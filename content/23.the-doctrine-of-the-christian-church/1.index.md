READ, FEBRUARY 16, 2024, to WISCONSIN LUTHERAN SEMINARY). [Wisconsin and Missouri: Overcoming Our Differences](https://cc.lutherclassical.org/spring-2023/wisconsin-and-missouri-overcoming-our-differences/){:target="_blank"}: "The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) ... were in fellowship with each other in the nineteenth and the first part of the twentieth centuries. The Wisconsin Synod broke fellowship with the Missouri Synod in 1961. Several doctrinal issues occasioned the break, the most prominent being differences between them on the practice of church fellowship._ ... Their disagreement has been on the form of the visible church and her ministry. Does Christ’s **visible Church** on earth have a divinely fixed form? Does the **Church’s ministry** have a divinely fixed form? Wisconsin said no. Missouri said yes." (Follow link and read about it in paragraph 1 and 4).
