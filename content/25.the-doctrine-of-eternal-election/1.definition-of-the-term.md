The central teaching of Scripture is the comforting doctrine of God's grace in Christ Jesus toward fallen and lost mankind, Rom. 3, 23. 24; Eph. 2, 8. 9. To this divine grace the Christian owes his conversion, justification, sanctification, and preservation in faith, 2 Tim. 1, 9; Titus 3, 7; 1 Cor. 15, 10. That is the doctrine of the sola gratia, which Scripture teaches so plainly and consolingly.
