title: 3. THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION THE CENTRAL DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.
description: 
---

It requires little proof to show that the article of justification by faith is the central doctrine (_articulus fundamentalissimus, articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae_) of the entire Christian religion; for it is the preeminent teaching of Holy Scripture, to which all the sacred truths of the Gospel converge. What the Word of God tells us of Christ’s incarnation, suffering, death, resurrection, etc., is only the foundation of this paramount doctrine; for Christ became incarnate, suffered, died, rose again, etc., in order that sinners, who could not be saved by their own efforts, might be justified by grace, through faith in His vicarious atonement. Hence those who deny the Scriptural doctrine of justification by faith deny the entire Christian religion; for they are compelled to teach the paganistic way of salvation by works, by which the Gospel of Christ is annulled. 

## Scripture

It is for this reason that Scripture so emphatically insists upon the clear and unadulterated proclamation of salvation by faith in Christ, [John 3, 16](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/3-16.htm){:target="_blank" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."}; [Rom. 3, 23—28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A23-28&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, ..."}; [1 Cor. 2, 2 ff](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202%3A2-5&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God."}.; [Gal. 2, 21](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/2-21.htm){:target="_blank" title="I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose."}; [5, 4](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/5-4.htm){:target="_blank" title="You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace."}; [Eph. 2, 8. 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-9&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."}; [Phil. 3, 8. 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203%3A8-9&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title=" Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith"}; [Gal. 1, 8. 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201%3A8-9&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed."}; [3, 1—3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A1-3&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"}; [5, 4](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/5-4.htm){:target="_blank" title="You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace."}; etc. The entire polemics of Scripture culminates in the refutation of all heresies that pervert the article of justification through faith in Christ, [John 8, 24](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/8-24.htm){:target="_blank" title="I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins."}; [Acts 10, 42. 43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010%3A42-43&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."}; [Gal. 1, 6—10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201%3A6-10&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title=" I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel — not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. ...  As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed."}; [Phil. 3, 2—9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203%3A2-9&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. ..."}, etc. Its supreme warnings and exhortations to the believer center in the appeal to continue in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, [2 Tim. 3, 8](https://biblehub.com/crossref/2_timothy/3-8.htm){:target="_blank" title="Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith."}; [Titus 2, 1—15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202%3A1-15&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine. ...  Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us. ..."}; [Heb. 4, 14—16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204%3A14-16&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."}; [1 Pet. 4, 1—5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%204%3A1-5&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God. ..."}; [1 John 5, 10 ff](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A10-12&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life."}., etc. All its teachings either point forward to it (_articuli antecedentes_), [Luke 24, 25—27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A25-27&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="And he said to them, 'O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?' And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself."}, or back to it (_articuli consequentes_). [Rev. 5, 9—14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%205%3A9-14&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="...  Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, 'Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!'"}. It is the paramount theme of the Old Testament, [Is. 53, 4—6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053%3A4-6&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all."}, and of the New Testament, [2 Cor. 5, 19—21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205%3A19-21&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title=" that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. ... We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."}. 

In short, the doctrine of justification by faith in the crucified and risen Christ is the entire Gospel. Wherever it is believed, there the Church of Christ, the communion of saints, exists; wherever it is not believed, there can be no Christian Church, since this has for its members only those who believe that Christ died for them and rose again, [Mark 16, 15. 16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A15-16&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title=" And he said to them, 'Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."}; [1 Cor. 15, 3. 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A3-4&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title=" For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,"}. Hence the Christian pastor must so administer his office that unfailingly he teaches this doctrine in its truth and purity and exposes and rejects all errors that are contrary to it. [Acts 26, 22. 23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026%3A22-23&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass: that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles."}; [Titus 1, 9](https://biblehub.com/crossref/titus/1-9.htm){:target="_blank" title="He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it."}. 

## Smalcald Articles

This is the clear demand which our Lutheran Confessions make of all who would serve as ministers of Christ’s holy Gospel. Thus the [_Smalcald Articles_](https://thebookofconcord.org/smalcald-articles/part-ii/article-i/){:target="_blank" title="Part II, Article I; The First and Chief Article"} ([II, 4](https://boc.confident.faith/sa-ii-i-0004){:target="_blank" title="Click to read from the Source..."}. 5) declare: 

> “Since it is necessary to believe this and it cannot be otherwise acquired or apprehended by any work, law, or merit, it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us, as St. Paul says, Rom. 3, 26. 28. Of this article nothing can be yielded or surrendered (nor can anything be granted or permitted contrary to the same), even though heaven and earth, and whatever will not abide, should sink to ruin. _For there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved_, says Peter, Acts 4, 12. _And with His stripes we are healed._ Is. 53, 5. And upon this article all things depend which we teach and practise in opposition to the Pope, the devil, and the (whole) world. Therefore we must be sure concerning this doctrine and not doubt; for otherwise all is lost, and the Pope and devil and all things gain the victory and suit over us.” 

Cp. also [Art. II, 1](https://thebookofconcord.org/smalcald-articles/part-ii/article-ii/){:target="_blank" title="Part II, Article II; Of the Mass."}: 

> “Of this article nothing is to be surrendered or conceded because the first article does not allow it.” 

## Solid Declaration

The _Formula of Concord_ writes in the same vein [Art. III, 6](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-iii-0006){:target="_blank" title="Click to read Article III. The Righteousness of Faith"}: 

> “This article concerning justification by faith, as the _Apology_ says, is the _chief article in the entire Christian doctrine_, without which no poor conscience can have any firm consolation or can truly know the riches of the grace of Christ, as Dr. Luther also has written: ‘If this only article remains pure on the battle-field, the Christian Church also remains pure and in goodly harmony and without any sects; but if it does not remain pure, it is not possible that any error or fanatical spirit can be resisted.’ ” 

## Lutheran Dogmaticians

This firm stand of our Lutheran Confessions on the doctrine of justification by faith is taken also by our Lutheran dogmaticians, of whom Chemnitz, for example, writes (_Loc. Th_., II, 216): 

> “This one point mainly distinguishes the Church from all heathen and superstitions, as Augustine says: ‘The Church distinguishes the just from the unjust, not by the law of works, but by the law of faith.’ Yes, this article is, as it were, the citadel and chief bulwark of the entire Christian doctrine and religion, which being either obscured or adulterated or subverted, it is impossible to retain the purity of the doctrine in other points. But if this doctrine remains untouched, all idolatries, superstitions, and perversions in all the other doctrines destroy themselves.” [_Doctr . Theol_., p. 440](https://archive.org/details/doctrinaltheolog00schmuoft/page/n449/mode/2up){:target="_blank" title="Click to read the original pages, 440-441"}. 

## Other Christians

Actually all true Christians, no matter how much they may be lacking in Christian knowledge and discernment on other points, hold to the doctrine of justification by faith, since all “are children of God _by faith in Christ Jesus_,” [Gal. 3, 26—28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A26-28&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."}; cp. [also 3,7](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/3-7.htm){:target="_blank" title="Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham."}. Those who repudiate this article are _extra ecclesiam_ [Gal. 3, 10](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/3-10.htm){:target="_blank" title="For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, 'Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them"}, or, as Luther says, “either Jews or Turks, papists or heretics.” Every true Christian confesses with Luther: “I believe that Jesus Christ, true God . . . and also true man, ... is my Lord, who has redeemed me, a lost and condemned creature,” etc. This truth we find attested especially in the many `Christian hymns`, which are the expressions of the personal faith of hundreds of Christians, who, though living at different places and times and belonging outwardly to different denominations, repeat the same joyous refrain: “By grace are ye saved, through faith,” [Eph. 2, 8](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/2-8.htm){:target="_blank" title="For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God"}.
