description: De Justificatione.
---

As soon as a contrite sinner believes the divine promises of grace which for Christ's sake is offered to him in the Gospel, or as soon as he puts his trust in the **vicarious satisfaction** which Christ has made for the sins of the world by His perfect obedience, he is justified[^1], or declared righteous before God, [Rom. 3, 23. 24](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/3-24.htm){:target="_blank" title="and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith."}. This is the so-called `subjective justification`, [Rom. 4, 6](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-6.htm){:target="_blank" title="just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:"}, or the **personal application**, through faith, of the merits which Christ has secured for the whole world by His substitutionary atonement (_objective justification_), [2 Cor. 5, 19](https://biblehub.com/crossref/2_corinthians/5-19.htm){:target="_blank" title="that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. ..."} ff.

Holy Scripture quite simply describes the act of justification `negatively` as a “forgiving of sins,” or a “covering of sins," or a “non-imputation of sins," [Rom. 4, 6—8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204%3A6-8&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: 'Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin."}, and `positively` as the “counting of faith for righteousness,” [Rom. 4, 5](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-5.htm){:target="_blank" title="And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,"}; [Gal. 3, 6](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/3-6.htm){:target="_blank" title="just as Abraham 'believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness"}; [Rom. 4, 3](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-3.htm){:target="_blank" title="For what does the Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness."}. `Subjective justification` may therefore be defined as the act of God by which He removes from the believer the sentence of condemnation to which he is subject because of his sin, releases him from his guilt, and ascribes to him the merit of Christ. Baier defines justification as 

> “the act by which the sinner, who is responsible for guilt and liable to punishment (_reus culpae et poenae_), but who believes in Christ, is pronounced just by God, the Judge.” [Doctr. Theol., p. 424.](https://archive.org/details/doctrinaltheolog00schmuoft/page/n433/mode/2up){:target="_blank" title="Click to read from the source on archive.org"}

By `subjective justification` we therefore do not understand “a moral condition existing in man or a moral change which he experiences, but only a divine judgment upon man, by which his relation to God is reversed.” [Ibid.](https://archive.org/details/doctrinaltheolog00schmuoft/page/n433/mode/2up){:target="_blank" title="Click to read from the source on archive.org"} Hollaz rightly says: 

> “Justification is a judicial and at the same time a gracious act by which God, reconciled by the satisfaction of Christ, acquits the sinner who believes in Christ of the offenses with which he is charged and accounts and pronounces him righteous.” [Doctr, Theol., p. 428](https://archive.org/details/doctrinaltheolog00schmuoft/page/n437/mode/2up){:target="_blank" title="Click to read from the source on archive.org"}. 

When defining justification by faith, we must bear in mind that justification by faith without works is based upon the justification of the whole world, secured by Christ’s **vicarious satisfaction** and offered to all men in the Gospel, [Acts 10, 43](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/10-43.htm){:target="_blank" title="To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."}. Because of the `objective justification` (reconciliation) `subjective justification` takes place “freely,” [Rom. 3, 24](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/3-24.htm){:target="_blank" title="and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus"}, no work on the sinner's part being necessary to complete the justification of Christ. If the **vicarious satisfaction** of Christ is denied, no room is left for justification by faith. On the other hand, the perfect redemption effected by Christ leaves no room for the papistic justification by works. The Gospel contains full pardon for every sinner, and as soon as he accepts the pardon by faith, he is justified subjectively. 

## Object of (justifying) faith

All who deny that the means of grace impart the forgiveness of sins (enthusiasts, Reformed, modern Lutheran theologians) and who make, not the redemptive work, but the “person of Christ” or His historical reality,” the **object of faith**, teach justification without faith by works, that is to say, by something in man, or by _gratia infusa_. However, that “faith is counted for righteousness,” [Rom. 4, 5](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-5.htm){:target="_blank" title="And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness"}, means that faith justifies, not considered in itself, but _because of **the object** which it apprehends_, namely, **the promise of the Gospel**. 

It is not Scriptural to say one must make only Christ or only His merit and not also `the objective justification` the **object of justifying faith**. — Only the direct promise of the Gospel can give us perfect assurance of the forgiveness of our sins. A justification by works from its very nature cannot but be productive of doubt. (Cf. [Rom. 4, 16](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-16.htm){:target="_blank" title="That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,"}.) The “theology of doubt” (_monstrum incertitudinis_) of papist theology is a necessary concomitant of the theology of work-righteousness. (Cf. Council of Trent, Sees. 6, Can. 13.) 

## The Roman Catholic

The Roman Catholic sect is the greatest enemy of the Christian Church; for all Christians live, move, and have their being in the doctrine of justification by faith. But this doctrine the papacy does not permit its adherents to accept and believe. It rather reviles and curses the Scriptural doctrine of justification by faith (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. 6, Cans. 9, 11.12.20) and trains its followers to seek salvation by works. The Church of Rome has murdered thousands bodily for their adherence to the doctrine of justification by faith and millions spiritually by teaching them to trust in justification by works. 

The Roman Catholic claim that the majority of modern Protestant teachers are advocates of the Catholic doctrine of justification by works is well founded. Those who deny the vicarious satisfaction and teach salvation through “morality” or through an “ethical act” or through faith as a “moral act” or “force” constitute a large majority among Protestants. Yet the doctrine of justification by faith, without works, has been believed and will be believed by all true members of the Christian Church to the end of time, Rom. [1, 16.17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A16-17&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, 'The righteous shall live by faith."}; [3, 21. 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A21-22&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it — the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction"}; [4, 3](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-3.htm){:target="_blank" title="For what does the Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness"}; [Rev. 7, 14](https://biblehub.com/crossref/revelation/7-14.htm){:target="_blank" title="I said to him, 'Sir, you know.'' And he said to me, 'These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."}. (Cf.
