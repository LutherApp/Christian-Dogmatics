title: 1. DEFINITION OF JUSTIFICATION.
description: De Iusti1lcatione.
---

As soon as a contrite sinner believes the divine promises of grace which for Christ's sake is offered to him in the Gospel, or as soon as he puts his trust in the vicarious satisfaction which Christ has made for the sins of the world by His perfect obedience, he is justified[^1], or declared righteous before God, Rom. 3, 23. 24. This is the so-called subjective justification, Rom. 4, 6, or the personal application, through faith, of the merits which Christ has secured for the whole world by His substitutionary atonement (objective justification), 2 Cor. 5, 19 ff.
