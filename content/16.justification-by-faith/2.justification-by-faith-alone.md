title: 2. JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH ALONE.
description: Sola Fide.
---

According to the express teachings of Holy Scripture the believer is justified by faith alone (_sola fide_), without the deeds of the Law, Rom. [3, 28](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/3-28.htm){:target="_blank" title="For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law."}; [4, 5](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-5.htm){:target="_blank" title="And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness"}; [Phil. 3, 9](https://biblehub.com/crossref/philippians/3-9.htm){:target="_blank" title="and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith"}. Positively, Scripture affirms this truth by ascribing justification directly to faith, [Rom. 3, 21—24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A21-24&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it — the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus"}, and negatively, by excluding from justification every work of man as a meritorious cause, [Rom. 3, 27](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/3-27.htm){:target="_blank" title="Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith"}. Indeed, Scripture emphatically declares that all who would be justified by works are under the curse. [Gal. 3, 10](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/3-10.htm){:target="_blank" title="For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, 'Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them"}, and it illustrates this fact by examples which leave no doubt as to the necessity of excluding human works from justification, [Rom. 4, 1—3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204%3A1-3&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness"}; [Luke 18, 9—14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018%3A9-14&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: 10 “Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. ..."}. 

## The righteousness of Faith

According to Scripture the attempt on the part of man to secure justification by his own efforts is “zeal not according to knowledge,” [Rom. 10, 2](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/10-2.htm){:target="_blank" title="For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge"}, and the insistence upon good works as necessary for salvation “a doctrine of the flesh,” [Gal. 3, 2.3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A2-3&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"}. On the other hand, it is the characteristic teaching of the Christian religion, which is of God, that sinners are justified before God solely by faith, without works. [Gal. 1, 8](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/1-8.htm){:target="_blank" title="But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed."}; [5, 4.5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A4-5&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness."}. Hence we must exclude from the act of justification not only `a)` all good works which God works in men in His Kingdom of Power (_iustitia civilis_), [Rom. 2, 14.15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202%3A14-15&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people."}, but also `b)` all spiritually good works, which flow from faith, [Rom. 4, 2.3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204%3A2-3&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness."}; for the exclusive particles (_particular exclusivae_), such as “without the Law,” “without works,” “not of works,” etc., [Rom. 3, 28](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/3-28.htm){:target="_blank" title="For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law."}; [4, 5](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-5.htm){:target="_blank" title="And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness"}; [Eph. 2, 8.9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-9&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."}, debar from the act of justification all human works whatsoever. 

### Solid Declaration

The _Formula of Concord_ says [Thor. Decl., III, 9](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-iii-0009){:target="_blank" title="Click to read from The Formula of Concord!"}: 

> “Concerning the righteousness of faith before God we believe . . . that poor sinful man is justified before God, that is, _absolved and declared free and exempt from ail his sins_ and from the sentence of well- deserved condemnation,.. . without any merit or worth of our own, also _without any preceding, present, or any subsequent works_, out of pure grace, because of the sole merit, complete obedience, bitter suffering, death, and resurrection of our Lord Christ alone, whose obedience is reckoned to us for righteousness.” 

## Why _works_ must be excluded from justification

Moreover, as the _Formula of Concord_ shows, Holy Scripture also points out the reasons why human works must be excluded from justification, namely, `a)` because God wishes to demonstrate the glory of His grace in the unmerited salvation of sinful mankind, [Eph. 2, 9](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/2-9.htm){:target="_blank" title="not a result of works, so that no one may boast."}; [1, 6. 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201%3A6-7&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,"}, and `b)` because He, in His infinite grace, has purposed to provide for lost mankind a salvation of which the sinner, on the basis of His gracious promise, may be absolutely sure and certain, [Rom. 4, 16](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-16.htm){:target="_blank" title="That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring — not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all"}. 

By teaching that justification is by faith, without the deeds of the Law, Holy Scripture rejects the papistic errors `a)` that justification is based upon infused grace (_gratia infusa_), or upon some good quality in man; `b)` that justification is a medical act (_actus medicinalis_), by which the sinner is made righteous through sanctification; `c)` that there are degrees (_gradus_) in justification, so that one believer is more justified than another; and `d)` that the believer cannot be sure of his salvation (_monstrum incertitudinis_). 

## The doctrine of _sola fide_

Positively, by its doctrine of _sola fide_, Scripture affirms `a)` that justification is based upon God’s gracious disposition in Christ Jesus (_gratuitus Dei favor propter Christum_), or upon divine grace, which is outside of man, “in God’s own heart,” though revealed and offered to him in the Gospel (_Media gratiae instru- menta iustificationis sunt_); `b)` that justification is a forensic act (_actus forensis_), by which God declares the sinner who believes in Christ to be righteous; `c)` that justification has no degrees, but is instantaneous and complete, the believer being justified as soon as he trusts in Christ for righteousness; `d)` that faith justifies not as a virtue or good quality in man, but solely as the instrument, or means, by which the believer lays hold of the perfect righteousness of the divine-human Savior; and `e)` that the believer may be sure of salvation, because salvation rests not upon his own worthiness, but upon the imputed merits of Christ. 

## Augsburg confession Art. IV

The doctrine of justification which the Reformers set forth in [Art. IV](https://thebookofconcord.org/augsburg-confession/article-iv/){:target="_blank" title="Read from the beginning of Ar. IV"} of the _Augsburg Confession_ is therefore truly Scriptural. It reads: “Men cannot be justified before God by their own strength, merits, or works, but are freely justified for Christ’s sake, through faith, when they believe that they are received into favor and that their sins are forgiven for Christ’s sake, who by His death has made satisfaction for our sins. This faith God imputes for righteousness in His sight, [Rom. 3](https://biblehub.com/esv/romans/3.htm){:target="_blank" title="Click to read Rom. 3 on BibleHub"} [and 4](https://biblehub.com/esv/romans/4.htm){:target="_blank" title="Click to read Rom. 4 on BibleHub"}.” By pronouncing upon this comforting doctrine of Scripture its anathema, the Church of Rome has proved itself to be the Church of Antichrist. 

## Presupposes as Necessary postulates

The doctrine of justification by faith, without the deeds of the Law, presupposes as necessary postulates `a)` objective justification, or the doctrine that Christ through His vicarious atonement has secured reconciliation for the whole world; `b)` universal grace (_gratia universalis_), or the doctrine that God earnestly desires the salvation of all men; `c)` salvation by grace alone (_sola gratia_), or the doctrine that the sinner is saved without any preceding, present, or subsequent human works; `d)` the means of gTace (_media gratiae_), or the doctrine that the Word of God and the Sacraments are the gracious means by which God offers and conveys to men the forgiveness of sins and righteousness which Christ has secured by His death (_media δοτικά_). 

All who deny these doctrines (Romanists, Calvinists, synergists) cannot consistently teach the Scriptural doctrine of justification by faith, since the rejection of these teachings invariably leads to the teaching of work-righteousness.
