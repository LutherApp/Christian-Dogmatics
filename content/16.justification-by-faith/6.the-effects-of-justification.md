title: 6. THE EFFECTS OF JUSTIFICATION.
description: Effectus Iustiflcationls.
---

As soon as a person has been justified by faith, he is in possession of all the spiritual blessings which Christ has secured for the world by His vicarious atonement, [1 Cor. 3, 21](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/3-21.htm){:target="_blank" title="So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,"}; [Rom. 5, 1—5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A1-5&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we[c] rejoice[d] in hope of the glory of God. ..."}. Having by faith received the adoption of sons, [Gal. 4, 5](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/4-5.htm){:target="_blank" title="to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons."}; [John 1, 12](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/1-12.htm){:target="_blank" title="But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,"}, he is an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ, [Rom. 8, 17](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/8-17.htm){:target="_blank" title="and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him."}, so that he lacks no spiritual gift whatsoever, [1 Cor. 1, 4—7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A4-7&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title=" I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus, that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge ... so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ"}; [Eph. 1, 3—8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201%3A3-8&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, ..."}. Of the spiritual blessings which justification confers we may mention in particular: — 

## a. The state of grace

a. _The state of grace (status gratiae)._ The justified believer is no longer under wrath, [Eph. 2, 1—3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A1-3&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="And you were dead in the trespasses and sins 2 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience ..."}, but in that blessed state where he has peace with God (_pax conscientiae_) , [Rom. 5, 1](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/5-1.htm){:target="_blank" title="Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."}. Through faith in Christ he is sure not only of divine grace in the present life, but also of eternal salvation in the life to come (_spes vitae aetemae)_, [Rom. 5, 2](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/5-2.htm){:target="_blank" title="Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God."}. The certainty of divine grace and eternal life through faith must be maintained against all SemiPelagians (papists) and synergists, who assert that a believer cannot be sure of salvation. As a matter of fact all those who uphold the “monster of uncertainty” (_monstrum incertitudinis_) thereby show that they are ignorant of what justification in its Scriptural sense really means. 

The “monster of uncertainty” is the unfortunate result of the mingling of justification and sanctification, or of the fatal error that salvation depends, at least in part, on human works. The objections against the certainty of salvation which have been raised also within the external Lutheran Church are utterly devoid of Scriptural ground; for such passages as [1 Cor. 10, 12](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/10-12.htm){:target="_blank" title="Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall."}; [Rom. 11, 20](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/11-20.htm){:target="_blank" title="That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear."}, etc., upon which these objections are founded, are designed not to intimidate the believer, but rather to warn those who are carnally secure and indifferent. Hence doubts with respect to the certainty of salvation must not be regarded or commended as a virtue, but must be condemned as unbelief, [Rom. 4, 16](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/4-16.htm){:target="_blank" title="That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,"}; [8, 17](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/8-17.htm){:target="_blank" title="and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him."}. [37—39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208%3A37-39&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, ... nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."}. 

## b. The indwelling of the Holy Ghost ...

b. _The indwelling of the Holy Ghost and of the Holy Trinity (inhdbitatio Spiritus Sancti sive Dei triuni essentialis)._ Through faith the justified believer receives the Holy Spirit, who dwells in his heart as in His holy temple, [Gal. 3, 2](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/3-2.htm){:target="_blank" title="Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?"}; [1 Cor. 3, 16](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/3-16.htm){:target="_blank" title="Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?"}, strengthening his faith and moving him to continuous childlike prayer, [Gal. 4, 6](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/4-6.htm){:target="_blank" title="And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!"}; [Rom. 8, 15.16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208%3A15-16&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, 'Abba! Father!' The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,"}. 

But according to Scripture not only the Holy Spirit, but also the entire Holy Trinity dwells essentially in the believer, [John 14, 23](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/14-23.htm){:target="_blank" title="Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him."}. This wonderful union of God with the believer is called _unio spiritualis_, or _unio mystica_, [1 Cor. 6, 17](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/6-17.htm){:target="_blank" title="But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him."}; [Eph. 5, 30—32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205%3A30-32&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="because we are members of his body. 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church."}. While through the mystic union the substance of the Christian is not transformed into that of God, as mystics at all times have affirmed (Weigel, Schwenkfeld), we nevertheless maintain on the basis of Scripture that God Himself (_unio essentialis_) and not merely His gifts (_dona Dei_; papists. Calvinists), dwells in the believer. 

With equal emphasis we at the same time reject the error of Andrew Osiander, who taught that the essential indwelling of Christ is the believer’s righteousness before God; for Christ is our Eighteousness inasmuch as He has redeemed us by His vicarious atonement and not inasmuch as He, with His essential righteousness, is found within us. In other words, our righteousness before God is Christ’s perfect obedience (_obedientia activa et passives; iustitia aliena_), which we appropriate through faith, [Rom. 3, 24](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/3-24.htm){:target="_blank" title="and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,"}; [5, 18.19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A18-19&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous."}. 

## c. Sanctification, or renewal

c. _Sanctification, or renewal (sanctificatio vel renovatio)._ By sanctification, or renewal, we understand the inward transformation of the believer through the Holy Ghost (_mutatio hominis interna per actum physicum vel medicinalem_), by which he is removed from the service of sin and made fit for the service of God in a new spiritual life (_iustitia inhaerens; iustitia vitae_). 

These inward spiritual changes occur in the very moment in which a person is justified by faith; for they are the unfailing fruits of justification, [Rom. 6, 1—11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206%3A1-11&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? ..."}. Before a person is justified, neither sanctification nor good works are to be found in him, [Eph. 2, 1—3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A1-3&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air ..."}; but after justification he is continually being sanctified and actuated to good works through faith in Christ, [Eph. 2, 10](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/2-10.htm){:target="_blank" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."}; [Gal. 5, 6](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/5-6.htm){:target="_blank" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love."}. For this reason sanctification and good works are indications (_indicia_) of the accomplished justification, [1 These. 4, 9](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm){:target="_blank" title="Now concerning brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another,"}; [John 14, 15](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/14-15.htm){:target="_blank" title="If you love me, you will keep my commandments."}, though they are never a cause of justification, [Eph. 2, 8. 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-9&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."}. 

## d. The Christian liberty

d. _The Christian liberty (libertas Christiana)._ By Christian liberty we mean the believer’s absolute freedom from every form of human tyranny in spiritual matters. [Gal. 5, 1—4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A1-4&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. ...  You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace."}. In other words, the justified believer is no longer a servant of men, [1 Cor. 7, 23](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/7-23.htm){:target="_blank" title="You were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men."}, to heed and obey human doctrine, but he is a servant of God, [Rom. 6, 22](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/6-22.htm){:target="_blank" title="But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life."}, and of Christ, [1 Cor. 3, 23](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/3-23.htm){:target="_blank" title="and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s."}, whose Word is the only rule of his faith, [John 8, 31. 32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A31-32&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."}. In relation to God all Christians are subordinate, for they all are equally bound to His Word and subject to His will, [1 John 5, 3](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_john/5-3.htm){:target="_blank" title="For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome."}; [Matt. 22, 38—40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022%3A38-40&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets"}; but in relation to one another they are brethren, [Matt. 23, 8](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/23-8.htm){:target="_blank" title="But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers."}, who are alike obedient to their divine Master, [Luke 17, 10](https://biblehub.com/crossref/luke/17-10.htm){:target="_blank" title="So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty."}, and subservient to one another in love, [Gal. 5, 13.14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A13-14&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself."}. 

Hence in the Christian Church not the word of man must prevail, but only the Word of God. Christian liberty thus consists in the believer’s freedom from the doctrines of men. [Matt. 16, 9](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/16-9.htm){:target="_blank" title="Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?"}, and his unswerving attachment to Christ and His Word. 

## e. Membership in the Christian Church ...

e. _Membership in the Christian Church and possession of all its gifts and blessings._ The Christian Church is the communion of saints, that is, of all true believers in Christ, [1 Cor. 1, 1. 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A1-2&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="... To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours"}; [Eph. 1, 1](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/1-1.htm){:target="_blank" title="Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus"}; [2, 20](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/2-20.htm){:target="_blank" title="built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,"}; [Acts 5, 14](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/5-14.htm){:target="_blank" title="And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,"}. Hypocrites, or nominal Christians, are not members of the Church, though in this life they are outwardly joined with the visible Church. The rights and privileges of the Church, commonly called the Office of the Keys (_potestas clavium_), that is, the peculiar church power to administer the means of grace, to forgive and retain sins, to preach the Word of God in its purity, to call and ordain ministers, etc., belong to all believers and not merely to the clergy, [Matt. 16, 19](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/16-19.htm){:target="_blank" title="I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."}; cp. with [18, 18](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/18-18.htm){:target="_blank" title="Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."}; [28, 19. 20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A19-20&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age"}; [1 Cor. 3, 21](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/3-21.htm){:target="_blank" title="So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,"}, as will be shown later.
