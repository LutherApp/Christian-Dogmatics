Christ’s state of exaltation began with His return to life in the grave and exhibited itself to the lower world by His descent into hell, to the world by His glorious resurrection, and to the highest heavens by His ascension and session at the right hand of God the Father.

The doctrine of Christ’s exaltation is clearly taught in Phil. 2,9—11; Eph. 1, 20—23; 4,10; etc. Th & Formula of Concord expressly rejects the error (kenosis) that Christ was exalted according to His divine nature.

As Christ’s humiliation, so also His exaltation took place for our salvation, so that in the doctrine of the two states the entire Gospel of reconciliation is wrapped up, Rom. 4, 25; 2 Cor. 5, 18—21. Our Christian faith rests upon both the crucified and the glorified Christ, 1 Cor. 15,1—23; Rom. 4, 25.
