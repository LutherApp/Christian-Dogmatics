Holy Scripture expressly calls Christ true God and ascribes to Him all the divine attributes; but it also calls Christ true man and ascribes to Him all the attributes common to men. Christ is therefore true God and true man, or the God-man _θεάνθρωπος_.

For this reason we must reject as unscriptural every doctrine which denies or limits a) the true deity of Christ (Monarchianism, Unitarianism), b) His true humanity (Docetae, Gnostics, Anabaptists), and c) the personal union of the two natures in the one Person (unio personalis) together with the resultant doctrines of the communion of the two natures (_communio naturarum_) and the communication of attributes (_communicatio idiomatum_). The controversies of the Lutherans in defense of the last two doctrines were directed not only against the Calvinists, but also against the papists.
