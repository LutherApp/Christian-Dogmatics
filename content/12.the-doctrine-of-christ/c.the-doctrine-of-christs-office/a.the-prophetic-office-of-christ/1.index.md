title: 1. THE EXECUTION OF THIS OFFICE IN THE STATE OF HUMILIATION.
description: De Munere Prophetico.

In His state of humiliation Christ did not teach as did the prophets of Israel, but as the unique Prophet sent by God (Propheta κατ' ἐξοχήν, Propheta omnibus excellentior, Luke 7, 16; John 4, 19; 6, 14, that is to say, immediately (avw:neoodmw~) and by His own authority, John 7, 46; 1, 18. Our Lord did not receive His divine doctrines by divine inspiration, 2 Pet. 1, 21, but possessed them as the omniscient Son of God, Matt. 23, 8. 10; Luke 24, 19; 4, 32; Matt. 7, 29; John 6, 63. Nor did He possess His divine knowledge merely according to His divine nature; for through the personal union (communication of attributes) also His human nature participated in the omniscience of His divine nature, Col. 2, 3. 9. (In Christo igitur Deus ipse munere prophetico fungitur, Heb. 1, 2.) Augustine: "Doctor doctorum Christus, cuius schola in terra et cathedra in coelo est."
