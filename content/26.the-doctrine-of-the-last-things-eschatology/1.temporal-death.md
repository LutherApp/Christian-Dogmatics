description: De Morte Temporali.

a. What temporal death is. Temporal, or bodily, death is not the total annihilation of man (Russellism; atheism), but the deprivation of natural life, occuring through the separation of soul and body (Baier). That temporal death is not the annihilation of the soul is clear from Matt. 10, 28; that it is not the annihilation of the body follows from John 5, 28. 29, where Christ tells us that the dead bodies, though turned to dust, are awaiting in their graves the day of resurrection (cp. also Dan. 12, 2). That death, properly speaking, is separation of the soul from the body is clearly taught in Luke 12, 20: "This night thy soul shall be required of thee"; and in Matt. 27, 50 (John 19, 30), where the death of our Lord on the cross is described as the "yielding up of the ghost," or as the "giving up of the ghost."
