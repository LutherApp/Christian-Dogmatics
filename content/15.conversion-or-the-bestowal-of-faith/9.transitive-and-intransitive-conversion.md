title: 9. TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE CONVERSION.
description: Conversio Transitive; Conversio Intransitive.
---

On the basis of Holy Scripture our dogmaticians speak of **transitive** and **intransitive** conversion (_conversio transitiva; conversio intransitiva_). In other words, God is said to convert man, and again, man is said to convert himself ([Jer. 31, 18](https://biblehub.com/crossref/jeremiah/31-18.htm){:target="_blank"}, [Acts 3, 19](https://biblehub.com/text/acts/3-19.htm){:target="_blank" title="Repent = μετανοήσατε"}, μετανοήσατε; [Jer. 24, 7](https://biblehub.com/text/jeremiah/24-7.htm){:target="_blank" title="they shall return = יָשֻׁ֥בוּ"}, [יָשֻׁ֥בוּ]). Between the two, however, there is no real distinction (_realis distinctio_), since man converts himself only when God converts him. Both expressions therefore describe one and the same act, of which God alone is the efficient Cause. The expressions must therefore not be understood in the synergistic sense as though God began while man himself accomplished or completed conversion. While the expression “intransitive conversion” (“Man converts himself”) is Scriptural, it must not be forgotten that in conversion God “worketh in man both to will and to do,” [Phil. 2, 13](https://biblehub.com/crossref/philippians/2-13.htm){:target="_blank"}. 

Baier's remark on the point is truly Scriptural. He writes: “_The word conversion_ is taken in a double sense in the Scriptures, inasmuch as at one time God is said to convert man and at another that man is said to convert himself, although as to the thing itself (_quoad rem_) the action is one and the same (_una et eadem_)" That God alone works conversion is abundantly proved in Scripture, [Jer. 31, 18](https://biblehub.com/crossref/jeremiah/31-18.htm){:target="_blank" title="I have heard Ephraim grieving,‘You have disciplined me, and I was disciplined, like an untrained calf;"}; [John 6, 44](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/6-44.htm){:target="_blank" title="No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day."}; [Eph. 1, 19](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/1-19.htm){:target="_blank" title="and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might "}; etc. These passages do not allow even a modified form of synergism (Man’s conversion depends on his necessary condition of passiveness and submissiveness toward the Gospel call; cp. Latermann, Dieckhoff, etc.).
