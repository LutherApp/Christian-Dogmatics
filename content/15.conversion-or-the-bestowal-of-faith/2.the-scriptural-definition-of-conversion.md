[1502coercion]: ## "coercion synonyms; force, threats, pressure, demand, enforcement, harassment, insistence, arm-twisting, influence, pressurization"

Conversion (_conversio, ἐπιστροφή, μετάνοια_) does not consist in a person's attempt to make amends for his sins and to appease the wrath of God by works; nor is it mere sorrow (_contritio_) over, or disgust at, sin or a solemn resolution on the part of man to improve his life by good works; for all these things even the unconverted may do, [Matt. 27, 3](https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-3.htm){:target="_blank"}. 4; [1 Sam. 24, 16](https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm){:target="_blank"}-22. But conversion is essentially the bestowal of faith (_donatio fidei_) in the divine promise of salvation for Christ's sake upon a sinner who from the divine Law has learned to know and lament his sins, [Mark 1, 14](https://biblehub.com/mark/1-14.htm){:target="_blank"} .15. 

This is the true Scriptural definition of conversion as it is described in [Acts 11, 21](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/11-21.htm){:target="_blank"}: “A great number believed and turned unto the Lord” (_πολύς τε άρι&μός δ πιστενσας ίπέοτρεψεν έπί τόν κύριον_). The turning to God, or conversion, of the great number, as here related, was accomplished by faith in “the preaching of the Lord Jesus,” [v. 20](https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm){:target="_blank"}. That is to say, the Lord Jesus was preached; a great number believed the Gospel of Christ and thus turned unto the Lord. 

In accord with this and other passages, [John 1, 45](https://biblehub.com/john/1-45.htm){:target="_blank"}—50; [Acts 8, 34](https://biblehub.com/acts/8-34.htm){:target="_blank"}—38; [16, 30](https://biblehub.com/acts/16-30.htm){:target="_blank" title="Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”"}—34, **Luther** defines conversion as follows: “To convert oneself to God means to believe that Christ is our Mediator and that we have eternal life through Him.” (Cp. St. L., [XIIIa, 1101](https://archive.org/details/st-l-13a-en-us/page/n565/mode/2up?q=%22To+convert%22&view=theater){:target="_blank" title="Important! Read more about this in note 1 below."};[^1] [V, 590](https://archive.org/details/st-l-05-deep-l-en/page/n303/mode/2up?view=theater){:target="_blank"}.[^3] Pieper, _Christl. Dogmatik_, [II, 545](https://archive.org/details/pieper-cdk-2-001-672-deep-l-en/page/545/mode/2up){:target="_blank" title="Important! Read more about this in note 2 below."} ff.) So also our dogmaticians declare that conversion takes place in that moment when the Holy Spirit engenders faith in the heart of the penitent sinner. Hollaz describes conversion as “the act of grace by which the Holy Spirit excites in the sinner sincere grief for his sins by the Word of the Law and enkindles true faith in Christ by the Word of the Gospel.” [Doctr. Theol., p. 466](https://archive.org/details/doctrinaltheolog00schmuoft/page/n475/mode/2up){:target="_blank"}.

In short, a person is truly converted only when he believes that God has graciously forgiven his sins for Christ’s sake; or we may say: A converted person is a true believer in the divine-human Christ, the only Savior from sin. For this reason we must reject all definitions which identify conversion with a mere `change of mind` or with a mere `moral improvement of life` (_reformatio vitae_) as these have been given by ancient and modern rationalists (Pelagians, Unitarians, Modernists, etc.). We readily admit that also an unconverted person may improve his life externally (_iustitia civilis_), that he may suppress this or that vice and cultivate this or that virtue, [1 Tim. 5, 8](){:target="_blank"}; but unless a person penitently receives the grace of God offered to him in Christ Jesus, he remains spiritually lost in spite of such change of conduct, [Luke 18, 10](https://biblehub.com/crossref/luke/18-10.htm){:target="_blank" title="Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector."}—14. His outward “good works” will be duly rewarded in this life (_in regno potentiae_); but since he is outside the Kingdom of Grace (_regnum gratiae_), he is without God, [Eph. 2, 12](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm){:target="_blank" title="remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world."}, and without hope of salvation, [Mark 16, 15](https://biblehub.com/crossref/mark/16-15.htm){:target="_blank"}. 16. To this truth the whole Bible bears witness. Luther: “God does not desire to be gracious to any people, either Jew or Gentile, unless they are converted, that is to say, unless they believe God with all their heart.” [St. L., III, 1697](https://archive.org/details/st-l-03-deep-l-en/page/n857/mode/2up?view=theater){:target="_blank" title="Read more of the quotation below in note 3."}[^3]. 

## Important about conversion

Because the Scriptural doctrine of conversion is of such eminent importance, it must be guarded against all error. To this end the Christian theologian must not only rule out all unscriptural doctrine on this point, but he must see to it that the terminology which he employs is in agreement with Scripture. Let him therefore consider the following points from the outset: — 

### a. Not a meritorious work, performed by man

a. Any teaching which makes of conversion a meritorious work, performed by man (papists: penance; Unitarians: a moral change) or the product of man’s power, either in whole or in part (Pelagianism, synergism), destroys the Christian faith and frustrates the sinner’s conversion and justification. 

### b. Contrition and faith is the essential element in conversion

b. The two essential elements in conversion are **contrition** and **faith**, [Mark 1, 16](https://biblehub.com/mark/1-16.htm){:target="_blank"}; [Acts 16, 30](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/16-30.htm){:target="_blank" title="Then he brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"}. 31; [Jer. 3, 13](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-13.htm){:target="_blank" title="Click to read this Bible verse!"}. 14. Contrition (_terrores conscientiae_), however, does not form the beginning of, or one half of, conversion, nor does it produce a better spiritual condition in the sinner; the terrified sinner hates God all the more because of his knowledge of sin and flees from Him. Contrition belongs to conversion only for the reason that faith cannot find entrance into the proud and secure heart; it is “the indispensable preparation for conversion.” Contrition is the effect of the preaching of the Law, which by itself cannot save a single sinner. [Gal. 2, 16](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/2-16.htm){:target="_blank"}. (Cf. the contrition of Judas, [Matt. 27, 3](https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-3.htm){:target="_blank"}—5.)[^4] 

### c. Not required with a fixed degree of contrition

c. Pietists and Methodists demand a fixed degree of contrition; but what is required is “that a person not only dreads the temporal effects of his sins, but also regards himself as lost forever on account of his sins, [Luke 18, 13](https://biblehub.com/crossref/luke/18-13.htm){:target="_blank" title="But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’"}.”[^5]

### d. What constitutes conversion?

d. Even the kindling of the first spark of faith in the sinner’s heart, or his longing after the grace of God in Christ, constitutes conversion. (Cf. _Formula of Concord_, Thor. Decl., II, [64](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0064){:target="_blank"}. [14](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0014){:target="_blank"}.) 

### e. Sanctification is the inevitable result of conversion

e. Conversion in a wider sense embraces **sanctification**, which is the inevitable result of conversion in the narrow sense (_donatio fidei_). _Much confusion and error has been caused by not keeping the two uses of the term separate_. 

### f. The doctrine of conversion is perverted by

f. The Scriptural doctrine of conversion is perverted 1) by the **papists** (conversion through man’s _voluntary reception_ of grace and its gifts, by which the unjust man becomes a just man); 2) by all **rationalists** (Unitarians, Modernists), who define conversion as the _“moral reformation”_ of the sinner; 3) by the **synergists**, who condition God’s forgiveness on faith as an _“ethical act”_; and 4) by all **errorists** who make the hatred of sin and the purpose to amend one’s life the constitutive element of conversion or who (Pietists, Methodists) claim that sorrow for sin from love toward God moves God to be gracious. 

### g. Conversion tak place instantaneously

g. Conversion does not take place by stages, or degrees, but instantaneously; for while the preparation for conversion (_motus praeparatorii_, which are chiefly the terrors of conscience, wrought by the Law) may extend over a period of time, conversion proper, or the kindling of faith, is effected in a moment. There is no intermediary state (_status medius_) in which man is semi-dead or semi-living, [John 3, 18](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/3-18.htm){:target="_blank"}. The synergists advocate the intermediary state, progressive, or successive, conversion, for the purpose of introducing at some stage of the process man’s cooperation. On the other hand, all enthusiasts (Pietists, Methodists) go beyond Scripture in denying that one is genuinely converted who cannot fix the exact moment of his conversion. 

### h. Repentance vs. contrition

h. The term repentance is sometimes used for contrition and faith (conversion)[^1] and sometimes for contrition alone. — In Christians, repentance (conversio continuata, poenitentia stantium) continues until death because of the evil which is ever present with them, [Rom. 7, 21](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/7-21.htm){:target="_blank" title="So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand."}; [Heb. 12,1](https://biblehub.com/crossref/hebrews/12-1.htm){:target="_blank" title="...let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely..."}. The believer therefore turns daily with a contrite heart to the Gospel of the forgiveness of sins. Perfectionism denies this _continued_ conversion. [Matt. 18, 3](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/18-3.htm){:target="_blank" title="If you do not convert (ἡ εὐπερίστατον ἁμαρτίαν) and become like children, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven'}. 

### i. Conversion of those who had fallen from grace

i. The conversion of those who had fallen from grace (David, Peter; [Jer. 3, 12](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm){:target="_blank"}; [John 3, 7](){:target="_blank"}; [Gal. 4, 19](https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm){:target="_blank"}) is identical with the first conversion. The Calvinists, who, contrary to [Luke 8, 13](https://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm){:target="_blank"}; [Matt. 12, 43](){:target="_blank"} ff.; [Gal. 5, 4](https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-4.htm){:target="_blank"}; [1 Tim. 1, 20](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm){:target="_blank"}; [1 Cor. 9, 27](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm){:target="_blank"}; [10, 12](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-12.htm){:target="_blank"}, teach that true believers can never lose faith, do not acknowledge renewed conversion (_conversio reiterata, poenitentia lapsorum_) and therefore prevent it. The same is true of Perfectionism. 

### j. Conversion is not a substantial change

j. Conversion is not a substantial change, that is, not the creation of a new essence of the soul (Flacius, Weigel), but the complete transformation of the soul, or the creation of new qualities in man, [2 Cor. 5, 17](https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm){:target="_blank"}; [Ps. 51, 10](https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm){:target="_blank"}. To teach the latter, does not mean to teach mysticism (rationalists), but to affirm the true doctrine of Holy Scripture on conversion. 

### k. Conversion is not a mechanical action

k. Conversion is not a mechanical action; for in conversion God works in man as in a rational creature and not as in a “stone or block” [Formula of Concord](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0059){:target="_blank"}, [Joel 2, 12](https://biblehub.com/joel/2-12.htm){:target="_blank"}. 

### l. Conversion is not by coercion

l. Conversion is not by [coercion][1502coercion]; that is to say, God does not convert a person _against his will_ (by irresistible grace: Calvinism) ; for conversion consists in this, that “God makes willing persons out of the unwilling” (Augustine; _Formula of Concord_, [Epit., II, 15](https://boc.confident.faith/ep-ii-0015){:target="_blank"}). 

### m. The divine action in conversion

m. Our Confession rightly condemns as expressions that “do not conform to the form of sound doctrine” the following: “God draws, but He draws the willing”; “In conversion the will of man is not idle, but also effects something”; and: “Only be willing, and God will anticipate you” (_Formula of Concord_, Thor. [Decl., II, 86](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0086){:target="_blank"}). In accord with Scripture it describes the divine action in conversion as a “drawing of the Holy Ghost” (Thor. [Decl., II, 88](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0088){:target="_blank"}), [John 6, 44](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/6-44.htm){:target="_blank"}; [12, 32](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/12-32.htm){:target="_blank"}. 

### n. Man "does or works nothing, but only suffers"

n. In conversion man is only the _subiectum patiens_, or the _subiectum convertendum_; that is to say, man “does or works nothing, but only suffers” (_Formula of Concord_, Thor. [Decl, 11, 89](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0089){:target="_blank"}.90). 

### o. Against synergism "Confession" declares

o. Against synergism our Confession declares on the basis of Scripture: “Before the conversion of man there are only two efficient causes, namely, the Holy Ghost and the Word of God, as the instrument of the Holy Ghost, by which He works conversion.” (_Formula of Concord_, [Epit., II, 19](https://boc.confident.faith/ep-ii-0019){:target="_blank"}.) 

Some of these points will be considered at greater length later on under their proper heads. We group them here in order to show how necessary it is to guard the Scriptural doctrine of conversion against error and to point out how essential it is to define conversion correctly. (Cf. [Christl. Dogmatik, II, 542](https://archive.org/details/pieper-cdk-2-001-672-deep-l-en/page/541/mode/2up){:target="_blank"} ff.; Dr. Engelder, Dogmatical Notes.) 

[^1]: The quotation is not 100% correct. Here follows a "copy/paste"  of what Luther says in the last page of his preach about St. Paul's conversion, volume 13a, page 1101; _"Repentance" means to leave evil behind, to repent and grieve over it; "turn to God" means to believe in Christ, that he is our mediator and that through him we have eternal life."_

[^2]: Luther's quotation comes from the interpretation of the [Deut. 4, 29](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-29.htm){:target="_blank"}-31. Here follows more of the context; _Those who seek the Lord with all their heart and with all their soul. He will not be gracious to any people, whether Jews or Gentiles, unless they are converted through fear and hardship, that is, unless they believe in God with all their heart._

[^3]: Luther describes conversion in the interpretations on the Psalms, [vol. V, page 590](https://archive.org/details/st-l-05-deep-l-en/page/n303/mode/2up?view=theater){:target="_blank"}; _"if you want to be converted, it is necessary that you be terrified or killed, that is, that you have a fearful and trembling conscience. If this has happened in such a way, then comfort must also be received, not from any work you have done, but from the work of God, who sent His Son Jesus Christ into this world for this reason, so that He preached the comfort of mercy to terrified sinners, by grace, for nothing. This is the way to be converted;"_

[^4]: _"So they turn back, they leave the word, they do not look at what the minister or a Christian says by the command of our Lord Christ; they look only at their repentance and contrition. But in this way they lose Christ and everything that is Christ."_ Luther in House Postil (volume XIIIa), nineteenth Sunday after Trinity, section 35 page 923. See also _"Interpretations on John the Evangelist"_ (volume VII), last paragraph in second section, page 2131; _" Item, when you confess, do not stand on your confession and contrition, but see that you hear the preacher say, "I proclaim to you forgiveness of your sins in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."_

[^5]: The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (LCMS), was governed by C.F.W. Walter from its inception (1847). [Walter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._F._W._Walther){:target="_blank"} was a _repristination theologian_ according to [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Lutheranism){:target="_blank"}. This theology was originated in [Neo-Lutheranism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Lutheranism){:target="_blank"}. It is a historical fact that this [lutheranism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Lutheranism){:target="_blank" title="Click to read more about Neo-Lutheranism on WikiPedia."} was developed in reaction against theological rationalism and pietism.
