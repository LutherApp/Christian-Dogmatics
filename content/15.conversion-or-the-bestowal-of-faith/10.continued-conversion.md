title: 10. CONTINUED CONVERSION. 
description: Conversio Continuata.
---

On the basis of Scripture our dogmaticians speak also of continued conversion, that is, of that conversion which continues throughout the life of the believer, [Matt. 18, 3](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/18-3.htm){:target="_blank" title="and said, 'Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."}. The need of continued conversion is based upon the fact that the regenerate are not fully sanctified, but retain the Old Adam, [Heb. 12, 1](https://biblehub.com/crossref/hebrews/12-1.htm){:target="_blank" title="Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,"}; [Rom. 7, 21](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/7-21.htm){:target="_blank" title="So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand."}. [23](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/7-23.htm){:target="_blank" title="but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members."}, so that because of the sinfulness of their flesh and the manifold actual sins flowing therefrom they must live in “daily repentance,” [Rom. 6, 3—6](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Romans_6:3-6){:target="_blank" title="Bibleref"}. It is this “daily repentance” with which “continued conversion” (continued regeneration, resuscitation, illumination) must be identified. (_Poenitentia continuata sive quotidiana est dolor hominis iam conversi de residua ad peccandum proclivitate et vitiositate._) 

Holy Scripture distinguishes sharply between the first conversion (conversio prima) j by which the unregenerate becomes a believer in Christ, and the continued conversion (conversio secunda) of the believer, [1 Pet. 2, 25](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_peter/2-25.htm){:target="_blank" title="For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls."} (cp. also [v. 10](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_peter/2-10.htm){:target="_blank" title="Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy."}), which extends throughout his life, [Ps. 51, 1—12](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Psalms_51:1-12){:target="_blank" title="Bibleref."}. The conversio prima is complete when the believer is endowed with the first spark of faith (_scintillula fidei_), while his _conversio secunda_ is never complete as long as he lives in this world, [Rom. 7, 24](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/7-24.htm){:target="_blank" title="Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?"}. In the first conversion man is purely passive (_mere passivus_), but in the second he cooperates with the Holy Ghost according to the "new man” (ἔσω ἄνϑρωπος; καινὸς ἄνϑρωπος, [Eph. 4, 24](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/4-24.htm){:target="_blank" title="and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness."}), implanted in him in his first conversion, [Gal. 5, 17](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/5-17.htm){:target="_blank" title="For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. "}. [24](https://biblehub.com/crossref/galatians/5-24.htm){:target="_blank" title="And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."}; [Rom. 7, 22](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/7-22.htm){:target="_blank" title="For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,"}. [25](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/7-25.htm){:target="_blank" title="Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin."}. The second conversion must never be mingled with the first, as some synergists have done in the interest of denying the pure passive of the first conversion, by which the unregenerate becomes a believer.

Dogmatik, II, 559](https://archive.org/details/pieper-cdk-2-001-672-deep-l-en/page/559/mode/2up){:target="_blank" title="Read on page 560 about conversio prima, behaves mere passive, vs. conversion secunda/ continued conversion, where good works is involved"} ff.)
