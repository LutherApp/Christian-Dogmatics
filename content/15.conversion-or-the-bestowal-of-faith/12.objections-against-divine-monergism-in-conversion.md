title: 12. OBJECTIONS AGAINST DIVINE MONERGISM IN CONVERSION.
description: 
---

Among the numerous objections which have been raised against the Scriptural doctrine that God alone converts man (_Solus Deus convertit hominem_) the following deserve special notice: — 

## a. Is a part of man able to convert himself?

a. _Since God in His Word demands repentance, or conversion, of man_ ([Acts 16, 31](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/16-31.htm){:target="_blank" title="And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”"}; [Mark 1, 15](https://biblehub.com/crossref/mark/1-15.htm){:target="_blank" title="and saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."}), _he must be able, at least in part, to convert himself_. To this we reply that from the divine demand no conclusion may be drawn with respect to man’s ability to comply with God’s will. _A debito ad posse non valet consequents._ 

On the contrary, the divine commands and exhortations are the means by which God works that which He demands. Thus through the commands of the Law (_admonitiones legales_) He humiliates man and works in him true knowledge of sin, [Luke 10, 28](https://biblehub.com/crossref/luke/10-28.htm){:target="_blank" title="And he said to him, 'You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live."}; [Rom. 3, 20](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/3-20.htm){:target="_blank" title="For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin."}, while through the Gospel exhortations (_admonitiones evangelicae_) He works in him true faith, [Matt. 11, 28](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/11-28.htm){:target="_blank" title="Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."}. As an analog of the divine method of working through His omnipotent Word that which He wills we may cite the resurrection of Lazarus, [John 11, 43. 44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A43-44&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="BibleGateway"} (cp. also [Acts 3, 6](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/3-6.htm){:target="_blank" title="But Peter said, 'I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!"}) and the work of creation, [Gen. 1, 3](https://biblehub.com/esv/genesis/1.htm){:target="_blank" title="And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. ..."} ff. Hence we must not reason: “Why command men to do what they are utterly unable to do? Why bid a man believe when he cannot?” but rather regard both the _acmonitiones legales_ and the _admonitiones evangelica_e as the efficient means by which God accomplishes His beneficent purpose of saving sinners. That the synergistic argument _A debito ad posse valet consequentia_ is untenable Scripture clearly shows, [Matt. 11, 28](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/11-28.htm){:target="_blank" title="Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."}, cp. with [John 6, 44](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/6-44.htm){:target="_blank" title="No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day."}. 

With regard to the conditional clauses, [Rom. 10, 9](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/10-9.htm){:target="_blank" title="because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved"}, it may be said that these point out, not _real conditions_, but the means by which God accomplishes man’s salvation. Thus the statement “If thou shalt believe in thine heart, . . . thou shalt be saved,” means nothing else than “By faith thou shalt be saved.” 

## b. Is conversion an act of coercion or force, if man don't cooperate in his conversion?

b. _Unless man cooperates in his conversion, his conversion becomes an act of coercion (COACTIO), or force; in other words, in that case man is converted by irresistible grace, an assumption which Scripture condemns._ To this we reply that this objection ignores the very nature of conversion, which consists in the divine act by which God through the means of grace changes the unwilling into such as are willing, [John 6, 44](https://biblehub.com/text/john/6-44.htm){:target="_blank" title="draws = ἑλκύσῃ"}. Conversion is not an act by which God thrusts upon the sinner what he does not desire or forces him to receive what he does not want, but it is a gracious divine drawing ([John 6, 44](https://biblehub.com/text/john/6-44.htm){:target="_blank" title="draws = ἑλκύσῃ"}: ἑλκύσῃ), by which He works in him “both to will and to do,” [Phil. 2, 13](https://biblehub.com/crossref/philippians/2-13.htm){:target="_blank" title="for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure"}. Luther rightly remarks that God, in converting man, does not draw him as the hangman draws a criminal to the gallows, but by “softening and changing his heart” through the means of grace. _“Es ist ein freundlich Loclcen und An-sich-Ziehen, wie sonst ein holdseliger Mann die Leute an sich zieht.” ([St. L., VII, 2287](https://archive.org/details/st-l-07-deep-l-en/page/n1155/mode/2up){:target="_blank" title="(203) The drawing is not as the executioner draws a thief on the ladder and to the gallows; but it is a friendly attracting and drawing to himself, as otherwise a charming man draws people to himself, so that he is friendly and affable, and everyone goes to him gladly. So God also neatly attracts and brings people to Himself, so that they are willing and (page 2288) are glad to be around and with him. ... (204) Otherwise one runs from our Lord God, as from the devil and from a tyrant, when one preaches that God is angry, and one must propitiate Him with good works, and have the intercession of the saints, if one does not want to be condemned otherwise. This is not drawn, but deterred. ... (Read more about this 'drawing' on page 2288 in section 203 ff..)"} ff.) 

## c. God works the ability to believe...

c. _God works the ability to believe, but not the act of faith, or He prepares man for conversion, but does not accomplish it, since the final decision rests with man himself._ To this we reply that according to Holy Scripture the very act of faith is God’s work and gift, [Phil. 1, 29](https://biblehub.com/crossref/philippians/1-29.htm){:target="_blank" title="For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,"}; [Eph. 1, 19. 20](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Ephesians_1:19-20){:target="_blank" title="and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,"}; [Phil. 2, 13](https://biblehub.com/crossref/philippians/2-13.htm){:target="_blank" title="for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."}. We concede indeed that God works in man the ability to believe, but as soon as this ability has been bestowed upon the sinner, he is no longer spiritually dead, but alive in Christ, or what is the same, then he is already converted. Spiritual death in that case has been removed, and in its place spiritual life has been implanted in the heart. 

So the _Formula of Concord_ understands the well-known statement, which synergists so often have quoted in their favor (Thor. [Decl., II, 83](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0083){:target="_blank"}) : “Conversion is such a change through the operation of the Holy Ghosf in the intellect, will, and heart of man that by this operation of t le Holy Ghost man _can accept_ the offered grace” (_qua homo potest oblatam gratiam apprehendere_). According to the _Formula of Concord_ the person who “can accept the offered grace” is already regenerate; for it states definitely (Thor. [Decl., II, 85](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0085){:target="_blank"}) : “The man who is not regenerate resists God altogether and is entirely a servant of sin, [John 8, 34](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/8-34.htm){:target="_blank" title="Jesus answered them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin."}; [Rom. 6, 16](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/6-16.htm){:target="_blank" title="Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?"}. The regenerate man, however, delights in the Law of God after the inward man.” Hence our Confession cannot be quoted as favoring the modified doctrine of the later synergists, who affirmed that man can convert himself by using rightly the new spiritual powers communicated to him by God (Latermann, a disciple of George Calixtus, † 1662), or what is the same, that he can convert himself after God has bestowed upon him the ability to believe. 

## d. Is it the Holy Ghost that is the subject of faith?

d. _Unless man cooperates in his conversion, not he himself, but the Holy Spirit in him does the believing; in other words, in that case not man, but the Holy Ghost is the subject of faith._ However, if this argument were correct, it would apply also to the natural life of man, for God “giveth to all life and breath,” [Acts 17, 25](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/17-25.htm){:target="_blank" title="nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything."}. Yet though God is the sole Author and Preserver of human life, [Acts 17, 28](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/17-28.htm){:target="_blank" title="for ‘In him we live and move and have our being’; as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are indeed his offspring."}, every sane person agrees to the fact that man himself lives, moves, works, eats, weeps, rejoices, etc.; in other words, that the life, movement, and activity of a person are his own. 

## e. If man can damn himself, can he also save himself?

e. _If man can resist divine grace and so hinder his salvation. [Matt. 23, 27](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/23-27.htm){:target="_blank" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people’s bones and all uncleanness."}, then he can also assist divine grace and so make his salvation possible._ Expressed more briefly, the argument reads: _If man can damn himself, then he can also save himself._ To this argument we reply that this conclusion does not follow. For while Scripture ascribes to man the power to destroy himself, [Hos. 13, 9](https://biblehub.com/crossref/hosea/13-9.htm){:target="_blank" title="He destroys you, O Israel, for you are against me, against your helper."}; [Acts 7, 51](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/7-51.htm){:target="_blank" title="You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you."}, it emphatically denies that he can save himself, [1 Cor. 2, 14](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/2-14.htm){:target="_blank" title="The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned."}; [Rom. 8, 7](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/8-7.htm){:target="_blank" title="For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot."}; [Phil. 2, 13](https://biblehub.com/crossref/philippians/2-13.htm){:target="_blank" title="for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."}. Hence from the statement “Ye would not” we must not conclude with respect to the regenerate “Ye would.” What is true in the realm of grace is true also in the realm of nature. Man by suicide can destroy his life, but the life so destroyed he is unable to restore. So in the realm of conversion there is no _capacitas volendi_ corresponding to man’s _caponcitas nolendi_. 

## f. If man is unable to cooperate in his conversion, is conversion not a “moral” process?

f. _If man is unable to cooperate in his conversion, then conversion is not a “moral” process._ In order to meet this argument properly, we must bear in mind that the expression “moral” is ambiguous. We admit that conversion is a “moral” act inasmuch as in conversion God does not deal with man as with an inanimate creature (a block or stone), but rather as with a personal moral being endowed with reason and will. Taken in this sense, conversion may indeed be called a moral process; for in conversion the Holy Spirit enlightens the intellect, changes the will, and sanctifies the heart. However, conversion is no “moral process” in the synergistic sense, that man in his conversion cooperates with divine grace toward his regeneration; for Scripture, on the one hand, denies to man any power to convert himself, [1 Cor. 2, 14](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/2-14.htm){:target="_blank" title="The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned."}; [John 6, 44](https://biblehub.com/crossref/john/6-44.htm){:target="_blank" title="No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day."}; [Eph. 2, 1](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/2-1.htm){:target="_blank" title="And you were dead in the trespasses and sins"}. [5](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/2-5.htm){:target="_blank" title="even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved"}, and, on the other, positively declares that God is the sole Cause of his conversion, [Eph. 1, 19. 20](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Ephesians_1:19-20){:target="_blank" title="and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,"}; [2, 10](https://biblehub.com/crossref/ephesians/2-10.htm){:target="_blank" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."}; [2 Cor. 4, 6](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/4-6.htm){:target="_blank" title="I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another."}; [John 1, 12.13](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=John_1:12-13){:target="_blank" title="But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God."}. For this reason the _Formula of Concord_ rightly affirms (Thor. [Decl., II, 87](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0087){:target="_blank"}) : “The conversion of our corrupt will, which is nothing else than a resuscitation of it from spiritual death, is _only and solely the work of God_, just as also the resuscitation in the resurrection of the body must be ascribed to God alone.” 

## g. Free vs. coercion (force)

g. _Conversion is a "free” process in man. (Homo libere se convertit.)_ To this argument we reply that, if the term “free” is used in opposition to coercion, its application to conversion is justified, because conversion is that act of God by which He changes the unwilling into willing. (_Ex nolentibus gratiam volentes gratiam facit._) But the term “free” may not be applied to conversion in the synergistic sense, that man before conversion is “neutral,” so that he can decide either for or against grace (_ut possit velle aut non_). With regard to man’s relation to God and His kingdom there is no neutrality; for man is either with or against Christ, [Matt. 12, 30](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/12-30.htm){:target="_blank" title="Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters"}; [Luke 9, 50](https://biblehub.com/crossref/luke/9-50.htm){:target="_blank" title="But Jesus said to him, 'Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you."}. Luther writes: “Here there is no middle road; for we are necessarily either under the strong tyrant the devil, in his captivity, or under the Redeemer Christ in heaven. . . . Hence every man lives either with Christ against the devil or with the devil against Christ.” [St. L., VII, 172](https://archive.org/details/st-l-07-deep-l-en/page/n99/mode/2up){:target="_blank" title="Luther about Matt. 12. 30"}.

## h. Civil righteousness vs. Spiritual righteousness

h. _Man can cooperate in his conversion since he is capable of civil righteousness (iustitia civilis, probitas naturalis)._ In answer to this argument we say that, while man by nature is indeed capable of civil righteousness (_iustitia civilis_), he is of himself incapable of spiritual righteousness (_iustitia spiritualis_). He may indeed refrain from gross sins outwardly, but inwardly he cannot truly love God nor rightly keep His commandments, since with all his external righteousness he does not believe the Gospel of Christ, but rather hates and resists it, [1 Cor. 2, 14](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/2-14.htm){:target="_blank" title="The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned."}. The Pharisees gloried in their civil righteousness; yet Christ judged of them: “The publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you,” [Matt. 21, 31](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/21-31.htm){:target="_blank" title="Which of the two did the will of his father? They said, 'The first.' Jesus said to them, 'Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you."}. In spite of their “civil righteousness” the “princes of this world . . . crucified the Lord of Glory,” [1 Cor. 2, 8](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/2-8.htm){:target="_blank" title="None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."}. Even to the “best” Jews, Christ Crucified is a stumbling-block, and to the “best” Gentiles He is foolishness, [1 Cor. 1, 23](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/1-23.htm){:target="_blank" title="but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,"}, until they are converted, [1 Cor. 1, 24](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_corinthians/1-24.htm){:target="_blank" title="but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."}. 

## i. Is it cooperating to use the means of grace externally?

i. _Man is able to cooperate in his conversion since he can use the means of grace externally, that is, attend church, read the Bible, etc._ We readily admit that man by nature can externally use the means of grace, as also the _Formula of Concord_ declares (Thor. [Decl., II, 53](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-ii-0053){:target="_blank"}): “This Word man can externally hear and read, even though he is not yet converted to God and regenerate; for in these external things, as said above, man even since the Fall has to a certain extent a free will, so that he can go to church and hear or not hear the sermon.” Yet this external use of the means of grace does not presuppose any ability on the part of men to repent of their sins and believe in Christ; for even while they read or hear the Word, “the veil is upon their hearts,” [2 Cor. 3, 15](https://biblehub.com/crossref/2_corinthians/3-15.htm){:target="_blank" title="Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts."}, which veil is “done away in Christ,” [v. 14](https://biblehub.com/crossref/2_corinthians/3-14.htm){:target="_blank" title="But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away."}, that is, through faith in Christ, wrought by the Holy Spirit, [v. 16—18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203%3A16-18&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 18 And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."}. 

## j. Both _sola gratia_ and _gratia universalis_ must be taught - side by side

j. _If God alone works conversion in man, then it cannot be maintained that He really desires the salvation of all men; for. actually He does not convert all. To this we reply that Holy Scripture teaches both the sola gratia and the gratia universalis;_ that is, God alone converts and saves sinners, and He earnestly desires to save all sinners. Both doctrines must therefore be taught side by side without any modification or qualification of either of them. It is true, if this is done, the theologian is confronted with the perplexing problem, which human reason cannot solve, “Why, then, are not all saved?” (_Cur alii, alii non? Cur alii prae aliis?_) Calvinism solves the mystery by denying the _universalis gratia_; synergism, by denying the _sola gratia_, whereas the theologian who is loyal to Scripture does not attempt any solution of the mystery at all, just as little as he endeavors to solve the mysteries involved in the doctrines of the Holy Trinity, the personal union, the real presence, etc. Reason indeed argues thus: Since all men are in the same state of guilt (_in eadem culpa_) and only God, who earnestly desires to save all men (_universalis gratia_), can save sinners (_sola gratia_), the actual conversion of all men must needs follow. But the true theologian does not recognize reason as his principle of faith (_principium cognoscendi_) ; he is bound to Scripture as the only source and rule of faith, which, however, does not explain this _crux theologorum_. 

Scripture indeed affirms that God is the sole Cause of man’s conversion and salvation, [Phil. 2, 13](https://biblehub.com/crossref/philippians/2-13.htm){:target="_blank" title=""}; [Eph. 1, 19. 20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201%3A19-20&version=ESV){:target="_blank" title="and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places"}, and, on the other hand, that unregenerate man is the sole cause of his damnation, [Matt. 23, 37](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/23-37.htm){:target="_blank" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!"}; [Acts 7, 51](https://biblehub.com/crossref/acts/7-51.htm){:target="_blank" title="You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you."}; [Hos. 13, 9](https://biblehub.com/crossref/hosea/13-9.htm){:target="_blank" title="He destroys you, O Israel, for you are against me, against your helper."}. But it does not explain why of two sinners who are in the same guilt (David, Saul; Peter, Judas) the one is saved and the other is not.[^1] For this reason we reject the argumentation of _Melanchthon_: “Since the promise is universal and there are no contradictory wills in God, it necessarily follows that there is in us a certain distinguishing cause (_[aliqua discriminis causa](https://translate.google.com.ph/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=aliqua%20discriminis%20causa&op=translate){:target="_blank" title="for some reason"}_) why Saul is rejected and David accepted; that is, there is in these two a certain dissimilar action (_[aliqua actio dissimilis](https://translate.google.com.ph/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=aliqua%20actio%20dissimilis&op=translate){:target="_blank" title="some kind of unlike action"}_)” This synergistic explanation indeed satisfies human reason, for it explains why one is saved and another is lost; but it denies the sola gratia and thus repudiates the central doctrine of Scripture. 

The _Formula of Concord_ clearly points out the true position which the theologian must take when he faces the mystery of election and conversion. It says (Thor. [Decl., XI, 54-58](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-xi-0054){:target="_blank" title="Web editor's comment; Maybe quotation from 54 explain why one is saved and another is lost"}): 

> “Thus there is no doubt that God most exactly and certainly foresaw before the time of the world, and still knows, which of those that are called will believe or will not believe. . . . However, since God has reserved this mystery for His wisdom and has revealed nothing to us concerning it in His Word, much less commanded us to investigate it with our thoughts, but has earnestly discouraged us therefrom, [Rom. 11, 33](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/11-33.htm){:target="_blank" title="Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!"} ff., we should not reason in our thoughts, draw conclusions, nor inquire curiously into these matters, but should adhere to His revealed Word, to which He points us. . . . Likewise when we see . . . that one is hardened, blinded, given over to a reprobate mind, while another, who is indeed in the same guilt, is converted, etc., — in these and similar questions Paul ([Rom. 11, 22 ff](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/11-22.htm){:target="_blank" title="Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree."}.) fixes a certain limit to us how far we should go, namely, that in the one part we should recognize God’s judgment (for He commands us to consider in those who perish the just punishment of God and the penalties of sins). For they are all well-deserved penalties of sins when God so punishes a land or nation for despising His Word that the punishment extends also to their posterity,” etc. 

[^1]: Web editor's comment; Look at the the quotations from [Thor. Decl. XI 54](https://boc.confident.faith/sd-xi-0054){:target="_blank" title="Thus there is no doubt that God most exactly and certainly foresaw before the time of the world, and still knows, which of those that are called will believe or will not believe; also which of the converted will persevere [in faith] and which will not persevere;"}. Maybe this explain why: "God knows, which of those that are called _will believe_ or _will not believe_ ..."
