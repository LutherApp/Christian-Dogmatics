description: Conversio Reiterata.

It is a clear doctrine of Scripture that believers in Christ may fall from grace, or lose their faith, [Luke 8, 13.14](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Luke_8:13-14){:target="_blank"}; [1 Tim. 1, 19](https://biblehub.com/crossref/1_timothy/1-19.htm){:target="_blank" title="holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith,"}. This is proved also by the examples of David and Peter. This truth must be emphasized over against the Calvinists, who affirm that believers, when committing mortal sins, lose indeed the exercise of faith (_exercitium fidei_), but not faith itself. 

Our Lutheran Confession strongly condemns this Calvinistic doctrine as unscriptural and pernicious. It says [Smalcald Art., III, 42](https://boc.confident.faith/sa-iii-iii-0042){:target="_blank"}: “If certain sectarists would arise . . . holding that all those who had once received the Spirit or the forgiveness of sins or had become believers, even though they should afterwards sin, would still remain in the faith and such sin would not harm them: ... I have had before me many such insane men, and I fear that in some such a devil is still remaining.” On the other hand, it must be maintained that those who have fallen from faith may again be converted (_conversio reiterata_). (_Poenitentia iterata lapsorum, qui ad meliorem frugem redeunt._) This truth we hold against the ancient Novatians and their modern followers. [Augsb. Conf., XII, 9](https://boc.confident.faith/ac-xii-0009){:target="_blank"}. 

However, when the sinner has committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, reiterated conversion is impossible. [Matt. 12, 31—32](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Matthew_12:31-33){:target="_blank" title="Bibleref"}; [1 John 5, 16](){:target="_blank"}. Since, however, man can only in rare cases definitely know who has committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, it is the duty of the Christian Church to preach repentance and faith to all men as it has opportunity, [Ezek. 18, 23—32](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Ezekiel_18:23-32){:target="_blank" title="Bibleref"}; [3, 16—21](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Ezekiel_3:16-21){:target="_blank" title="Bibleref"}. 

With regard to the Terministic Controversy, which occurredi in the Lutheran Church early in the 18th century and in which the Pietists, on the basis of such passages as [Matt. 3, 7 ff.](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Matthew_3:7-13){:target="_blank"}; [7, 21](https://biblehub.com/crossref/matthew/7-21.htm){:target="_blank" title="Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."}; [20, 1—16](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Matthew_20:1-16){:target="_blank" title="Bibleref"}; [2 Pet. 2, 20](https://biblehub.com/crossref/2_peter/2-20.htm){:target="_blank" title="For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first."}; [Heb. 6, 4 ff.](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Hebrews_6:4-6){:target="_blank" title="Bibleref"}, defended “terminism,” that is, the doctrine that only a limited term (_terminus peremptorius salutis_) is accorded to an individual for salvation, while the orthodox Lutherans, on the basis of [Luke 23, 40 ff](https://www.bibleref.com/biblepassage/?search=Luke_23:39-43){:target="_blank" title="Bibleref"}.; [Rom. 5, 20](https://biblehub.com/crossref/romans/5-20.htm){:target="_blank" title="Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,"}; [Is. 65, 2](https://biblehub.com/crossref/isaiah/65-2.htm){:target="_blank" title="I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices"}, affirmed that God desires the salvation of every sinner throughout his life and that, if there is a shortened term of grace (_terminus gratiae peremptorius_), this is due only to the sinner’s self-hardening against the means of grace, the rule just stated suffices: The Church should not withhold, but bestow, the grace of the Gospel as long as men are ready to receive it, [Mark 16, 15](https://biblehub.com/crossref/mark/16-15.htm){:target="_blank" title="And he said to them, 'Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation."}.
