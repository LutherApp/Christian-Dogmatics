DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY 


OF 

DR. FRANCIS PIEPER 

( 1852 - 1931 ) 

OF WHOSE DOGMATIC WORK 

“CHRISTLICHE DOGMATIK” 


THE PRESENT VOLUME IS AN EPITOME 



FOREWORD. 

For over half a century the outstanding teacher of dogmatics at 
Concordia Seminary was the late Dr. Francis Pieper, whom the Lord 
called to his reward in June, 1931. His courses in Christian theology 
were given in German even to the last, and also his great work on 
dogmatics, his Christliche Dogmatik, was written in that language. 
It will always remain a standard reference work, which students and 
pastors who possess an adequate knowledge of German will study with 
profit and pleasure. Nevertheless, since many students of dogmatics 
do not understand German, a comprehensive text-book on the subject 
written in English has been desired for some time. Moved by the 
requests of many students and encouraged by his esteemed teacher 
and colleague to undertake the work, the undersigned applied himself 
to the task of writing this one-volume Christian Dogmatics. His aim 
was to present the voluminous doctrinal material in Dr. Pieper’s 
Christliche Dogmatik as clearly, concisely, and, at the same time, as 
completely and practically as possible in order that the student of 
doctrinal theology might have a usable compend to introduce him into 
this important field of sacred theology and the busy pastor an ade¬ 
quate epitome of the Christian faith to assist him in his review of 
the subject. The intention was not to render a possible translation 
of Dr. Pieper’s Christliche Dogmatik unnecessary, nor was it designed 
to take the place of a larger original work on systematic theology. 
It was simply to be a sizable handbook of Christian dogmatics pre¬ 
senting both to the theological student and to the practical pastor 
the qntire subject of doctrinal theology in a brief, yet complete sum¬ 
mary according to Dr. F. Pieper’s Chnstliche Dogmatik. 

While the writer followed Dr. Pieper’s standard work rather 
closely, he did not bind himself to details in form or content. For 
this reason the book may be used as an independent text-book, com¬ 
plete in itself. Commonly the footnotes were embodied in the text. 
The purely polemical matter was greatly condensed; but the writer 
did not deem it advisable to omit it altogether, since confessional 
Lutheranism cannot assert itself without directing attention to the 
opposing tendencies of Romanism, Calvinism, synergism, and ration¬ 
alism, which have always attacked and endangered the Lutheran 
doctrine. 

Dr. Pieper’s method of teaching dogmatics was in many ways 
ideal; nevertheless each instructor in this branch of sacred theology 
has certain aims in view which will more or less determine his method 
of presentation. The writer consistently followed Dr. Pieper’s custom 
of quoting Luther and the Lutheran Confessions on the major points

on which they have spoken, since the Lutheran student cannot discard 
their valuable testimony. In addition, however, he has frequently 
quoted also our older dogmaticians, using as his source the Doctrinal 
Theology of the Ev. Luth. Church by Heinrich Schmid, translated 
from the German and Latin by Chas. A. Hay and Hy. E. Jacobs. This 
popular volume presents to the student many helpful passages from 
the works of our great dogmaticians in a convenient form and there¬ 
fore deserves diligent study. The writer indeed does not agree 
with every statement of either Dr. Schmid or the cited dogmaticians, 
yet it is both interesting and instructive to consider their doctrinal 
expositions even in brief excerpts. While a fair knowledge of Latin, 
Greek, and Hebrew will greatly aid the student in understanding this 
Christian Dogmatics, it may be profitably studied even without the 
knowledge of these languages. Commonly the Scripture-passages are 
only indicated, but the reader is expected to compare them carefully, 
if possible in Greek and Hebrew, since the original often brings out 
the proof value of a text more distinctly than does the translation. 
Dr. A. L. Graebner’s Outlines of Doctrinal Theology may be used for 
collateral study. The writer has always employed this book in his 
lectures, both on account of its excellent definitions of the given doc¬ 
trines and its well-grouped Scripture-passages. However, the greatest 
profit will be obtained if this volume is used in connection with the 
more complete treatment of the various heads in Dr. Pieper’s 
Christliche Dogmatik. 

The writer wishes to thank his esteemed colleagues Dr. E. 
Engelder, Dr. W. Arndt, and Dr. P. E. Kretzmann for their careful 
and conscientious reading of the manuscript and their many helpful 
suggestions. He acknowledges his indebtedness also to Synod’s Litera¬ 
ture Board, especially to Rev. L. Buchheimer, Rev. A. Doerffler, and 
Mr. E. Seuel of Concordia Publishing House, to Prof. W. G. Polack 
and Dr. W. A. Maier for their hearty support and personal interest 
in the venture, and to his secretary, Rev. F. T. Gabert, for his services 
in retyping the manuscript. 

In view of the fact that this handbook is largely a restatement 
of Dr. Pieper’s Christliche Dogmatik the writer has consoled himself 
with the thought that even the “prince of the theologians of the 
Augsburg Confession,” Martin Chemnitz, was satisfied with publish¬ 
ing a mere commentary on Melanchthon’s Loci Communes, his justly 
famous Loci Theologici, and that this work proved so eminently suc¬ 
cessful in the Lutheran Church; also that the well-known dogmatics 
of John William Baier, his Compendium Theologiae Positivae, was 
really a compend of the theology of Musaeus and “many other orthodox 
theologians”; and finally, that also John Andrew Quenstedt’s Theo- 
logia Didactico-Polemica followed most closely the outline of John

Frederick Koenig, whose compend of theology, Theologia Positiva 
Acroamatica, was widely used as a text-book. We live by the light of 
the faith of our fathers. 

Since this handbook of doctrinal theology had to be relatively 
brief, much valuable dogmatic material was omitted. The student 
will find much additional dogmatic material in Pastoral Theology by 
Dean J. H. C. Fritz, D. D., and in the new Popular Symbolics by 
Drs. Arndt, Engelder, Graebner, and Prof. F. E. Mayer. These three 
handbooks, supplementing one another, leave hardly any question un¬ 
answered that pertains to Christian doctrine and a pure Scriptural 
practise. It is the writer’s privilege to recommend these two im¬ 
portant handbooks in connection with the use of this Christian 
Dogmatics. 

We are sure that the readers will appreciate the excellent 
Preface which our esteemed colleague Dr. P. E. Kretzmann has 
written upon the author’s request. This fine conspectus of dogmatic 
research may be viewed as compensatory since the limited space of 
the handbook did not permit any adequate treatment of more recent 
developments in the field of dogmatics. It may also serve the student 
who is more deeply interested in the modern phases of dogmatic lore 
as an outline and canon by which to orient his own studies. 

May this Christian Dogmatics, then, go forth on its errand of 
assisting all students of dogmatics who desire to use it in their study 
of Christian doctrine! Shortcomings though it may have, it is never¬ 
theless a clear and correct testimony of “God’s Word and Luther’s 
doctrine pure”; for it was composed with constant consideration of 
our Lord’s command: “If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles 
of God,” 1 Pet. 4,11.

PREFACE. 

In supplying a preface for the handbook of doctrinal theology 
which is herewith being offered to the theological world, the under¬ 
signed is fully aware that he will add nothing to the intrinsic value 
of the book. Yet in doing so, he is yielding to the repeated requests 
of the esteemed author, who desired a special introduction presenting 
a brief survey of doctrinal theology from the time of Schleiermacher 
to the present day. The supposition is that a foreword of this kind 
may serve some little purpose as a kind of foil to set off the beauty 
of a strictly confessional theology as compared with the frequently 
false, or at least inadequate, presentation found in the great majority 
of books on dogmatics which have been issued in the century since the 
death of Schleiermacher, in 1834. It is with this purpose in mind that 
this short introduction is written. 

We must begin, naturally enough, with Schleiermacher himself 
(1768—1834), for his influence has dominated the theological thinking 
of some of the most prominent dogmaticians since his time. The 
theology of Schleiermacher is largely, if not entirely, subjectivistic, 
as his chief writings, his Reden ueber die christliche Religion (1799) 
and his Christlicher Olaube nach den Grundsaetzen der evangelischen 
Eirche, im Zusammenhang dargestellt (1821—22), clearly show. 
There can be no doubt that he was governed by certain points in the 
system of Spinoza, and there is evidence also of his being influenced 
by the philosophy of Kant. His early theology was clearly pantheistic, 
the ideas of God and of the universe converging in his presentation, 
while Christ was to him the archetype of a pure consciousness of God 
and the mediator of genuine piety. His idea of religion was not that 
of a knowledge based upon the objective revelation of God, but the 
consciousness of a person’s “absolute dependence” upon God. The 
“overworld” of Schleiermacher is one which man “intuits” by faith, 
and faith to him is practically nothing but the immediate self- 
consciousness of man’s relationship to this “overworld.” His concept 
of sin and guilt is that of mere inadequacy on the part of man. To 
him Christ is not Himself the object of faith, but merely the archetype 
of the proper and ideal condition of soul in the case of every believer. 
According to Schleiermacher the essence of redemption and reconcilia¬ 
tion consists in man’s becoming conscious of the eternal unity. His 
“religion” is thoroughly and entirely a religion of feeling. If a person 
has reached that state of mind in which he feels that he is in fellow¬ 
ship of life with Christ, regardless of the Gospel revelation, he may be 
sure of his redemption, of his salvation. Schleiermacher did not per¬ 
mit one Christian doctrine to stand unchallenged, but subverted every

fundamental truth, from the inspiration of the Bible to the doctrine 
of the last things. 

Yet Schleiermacher found many adherents in his own day as well 
as many followers after his death, so that we may even speak of 
a school which was, and to some extent is, governed by his religious 
philosophy. One of the most prominent theologians among the con¬ 
temporaries of Schleiermacher was De Wette (1780—1849), who en¬ 
tered into friendly relations with the older teacher during his sojourn 
in Berlin. De Wette really denies revelation in the Scriptural sense. 
His doctrinal system is based upon the Kantian criticism, and he 
favored the theory of religion as feeling. He is the predecessor of 
Wellhausen and of the modern higher criticism. He insisted upon 
the distinction between intelligent, ideal, and esthetic convictions in 
religious matters, and his insistence upon this intelligent (or intel¬ 
lectual) appreciation of the doctrine of Christ deprived the Gospel of 
its Christian content, although he usually clothed his dogmatic presen¬ 
tations in the garb of the old orthodox terms. Another man who was 
first a pupil and then a friend of Schleiermacher was Twesten 
(1789—1876), who made the principles of his teacher his starting- 
point, but went beyond the idea of dogma as presentations of pious 
conditions of mind in an effort to establish objective truth. When 
Twesten, in 1835, became Schleiermacher’s successor in Berlin, he 
maintained a mediating position between Marheinecke and Hengsten- 
berg, the former being an exponent of Hegelianism, which excludes 
redemption and prayer and has no adequate conception of personality 
and no consciousness of sin, the latter representing a neo-orthodox 
legalism, although he did splendid service in opposing higher criticism. 
Twesten’s attitude of mediation became so strongly unionistic that 
he defended the association of all Christians living in one place at 
the same time, even without doctrinal agreement. A third man whom 
we must name as a faithful disciple of Schleiermacher is Schweizer 
of Zuerich (1808—1888). He became the exponent of the Reformed 
type of his teacher’s ideas and may be called a predecessor of K. Barth. 
His position showed an eminently speculative spirit, and his sub¬ 
jectivism is seen in his insistence that dogmatics must go to the 
living consciousness of the Christian for its material instead of to 
the objective certainty of the Word of God alone. 

More dangerous to sound confessionalism in many respects than 
Schleiermacher was Albrecht Ritschl (1822—1889), a man who 
gained some of his ideas from Kant, others from Schleiermacher, of 
whom he states that he was the only one since the Reformation to 
employ the scientific method of proof in theology. He subverts the 
very foundation of truth by referring to the “precarious medium of 
the theory of inspiration,” and he sought the facts of theology in 
religious consciousness. He rejected the deity of Christ, merely con-

ceding that Jesus was a religious genius, a religious hero, who had 
progressed so far in moral and spiritual attainments that to the Chris¬ 
tian He has “the value of God.” On the atonement of Christ he wrote 
a large monograph, in which he defends a doctrine which leaves out 
the cardinal points of the vicarious sacrifice of the Savior. The im¬ 
mortality of the soul is treated in his theology as an indifferent matter. 
The most objectionable feature of Ritschlianism is its two-facedness. 
It uses the old theological terms with new meanings; the negative 
liberal thought is clothed in the old orthodox expressions. While 
Ritschl retained a semblance of Christian theology, he either changed 
the Christian doctrine substantially or rejected it outright. His favo¬ 
rite expression is “the kingdom of God,” by which he means a general 
organization or fellowship of men, whose chief distinguishing mark is 
mutual activity on the basis of love, but without the objective truth 
of the Gospel. 

Among the university teachers of Germany who were strongly 
influenced by Ritschl (in some cases also by Schleiermacher) the fol¬ 
lowing exerted considerable influence: Wilhelm Hermann (+1922), 
who modified his teacher’s “reflections” concerning the historical Jesus 
by emphasizing intuition to such an extent as to make the term 
Christ-mysticism applicable to his teaching, while the Bible was re¬ 
garded by him as nothing but a form in which the Christian faith 
expresses itself, thus making his teaching strongly “modernistic”; 
Hermann Schultz (+ 1903), who also advocated an immediate re¬ 
ligious contemplation of Christ, whose historicity he regarded as 
problematical and whose deity he denied; then J. Gottschick, P. Lob- 
stein, Julius Kaftan, — one of the strongest exponents of the Ritsch- 
lian school, although he tried to return to the Confessions, — 
Th. Haering, who held wrong views concerning the guilt of man, 
H. H. Wendt, who is farther away from the truth, F. Kattenbusch, 
who is confessional in his attitude, P. Drews, who faces in the other 
direction, E. W. Mayer, O. Kirn, who denies the vicarious satisfaction 
and most other fundamental truths of the Bible, K. Thieme, and 
others. Among the American clergymen who were strongly influ¬ 
enced by Ritschlianism are W. A. Brown, C. F. Clarke, G. B. Smith, 
Wm. De Witt Hyde, G. W. Gladden, Rauschenbusch, King, Sellars, 
Ward, Vedder, and others, most of whom became the exponents of the 
social gospel with its destruction of the fundamental truths of 
Scripture. 

In Germany other forces beside the theology of Schleiermacher 
were at work during the first half of the nineteenth century. The 
last exponent of formal rationalism was Paulus of Heidelberg 
(+1851); men who were influenced by the pantheistic philosophy of 
Schelling and Hegel were J. M. Daub (+1856), who was very active in 
the field of religio-historical research, and Marheinicke (+ 1846),

whose doctrinal theology was influenced throughout by Hegel. About 
this time there was also a revival of Pietism, with a rather romantic 
coloring, favored by men like Novalis and Tholuck (who, with all his 
excellencies, could not understand confessional Lutherans), the move¬ 
ment stressing in particular the feeling of sin and of grace, also 
a supranaturalism and “Biblicism (a dead literalism),” which differed 
widely from the attitude taken by Fr. Strauss. In the midst of this 
turmoil we find certain trends which resulted in three more or less 
distinct schools of religious or theological thought. 

The first of these schools was that which is now known as the 
extreme, liberal school, with Ludw. Feuerbach (+1872) as one of its 
first great exponents and Ferd. Chr. Baur (1792—1860) as its chief 
apostle. The latter is the founder of the so-called Tuebinger Schule, 
which became notorious for its attack on practically every tenet of 
orthodox Biblical introduction and on every Christian doctrine. In 
his case the statement came true: “A theology that ceases to be 
a theology of the heart and to make the historical Christ the center 
of the Christian life will eventually suffer shipwreck with regard to 
its faith.” Yet the evil and detrimental influence of this movement 
was very great, not only through the work of men like Schwegler, 
Planck, and others in Germany, but also through the work of British 
and American theologians, who felt that the false higher criticism 
introduced by Bauer and carried on by men like Hilgenfeld must con¬ 
tain some elements of truth. These men practically killed the truth 
in the circles in which they moved. 

The liberal Tuebingen school found strong opposition in the con¬ 
fessional school centering in Erlangen, but equally powerful in the 
faculties at Leipzig and Rostock. The most important exponents of 
this school deserve more than a passing mention because they were 
strong defenders of the Bible truth and of the Lutheran Confessions, 
even if they erred in occasional matters. “The Erlangen theology 
presumed to be genuinely Lutheran, but frequently gave up the prin¬ 
ciple that Christian theology must be based on Scripture alone.” The 
fact that most of these men were accused of orthodox traditionalism 
is decidedly in their favor. Yon Hofmann (1810—1877) is the father 
of the Ich-theologie, a man who denied the verbal inspiration. His 
most notable doctrinal work is his Schriftbeweis. His attempt to 
prove the authenticity and divine origin of Christianity from its 
records was a mighty attempt, but this very effort caused him to lose 
sight of the transcendental presuppositions of history, so that his 
presentation of the doctrine of the Scriptural kenosis. of the vicarious 
atonement, and of justification is entirely false. Harless (1806 to 
1879), who “wanted to be more orthodox than the old Lutheran 
teachers,” but sometimes failed in his attempt, was especially active 
in the fields of catechetics and of church music. His Theological

Encyclopedia gives his views of the Church and of many other doc¬ 
trines, and his System of Christian Ethics marks an epoch in Protes¬ 
tant literature. Theodosius Harnack (1817—1889), who made 
a special study of Luther’s theology, was opposed to the state church 
and did some excellent work, but erred, for example, in making the 
Gospel a modification of the Law. Hoeflinq (1802—1853) was espe¬ 
cially active in the field of liturgies, in which his magnum opus was 
the monograph Das Sakrament der Taufe, but in which he also erred 
in the doctrine of the ministerial office. Von Zezschwitz (1825 to 
1886) was particularly prominent in the field of cateehetics; his con¬ 
fessional standpoint was soundly Lutheran, opposing both Romanism 
and the Prussian Union. Franz Delitzsch (1813—1890) is notable 
on account of his monumental work in the field of exegesis. He was 
broader in his views than von Hofmann, and his theology was not 
free from theosophic influences, just as he made certain concessions to 
the liberal position in the field of Biblical criticism, against which 
a conservative theologian must be on his guard. Gottfried Thomasius 
( 1802—1875) was great both as a writer and as a teacher and preacher, 
his most notable writing being Christi Person und Werk, in which 
unfortunately he teaches an unscriptural kenosis. Franz Frank 
(1827— 1S94) wrote the monumental work Theologie der Konkordien- 
formel, a veritable storehouse of the history of dogma in the sixteenth 
century, and that threefold masterpiece of theological learning. 
System der christlichen Gewiszheit — der christlichen Wahrheit — 
der christlichen Sittlichkeit. It is unfortunate that Frank, with all 
his amazing learning, clung to a false subjectivism, so that he did 
not place the Scriptures in the first place as the objective principium 
cognoscendi. Luthardt (1823—1902) was active in the field of exe¬ 
gesis as well as in systematic theology ( Kompendium der Dogmatik; 
13th edition by Jelke, 1933), his chief errors being in the doctrines of 
inspiration, the office of Christ (kenoticism), and regarding synergism. 
He was for many years editor of the Allgemeine Ev.-Luth. Kirchen- 
zeitung, which tried to uphold the sound Lutheran position. Kliefoth 
( 1810—1895), an opponent of von Hofmann in many points, is known 
for his extensive work in the field of liturgies and of church polity, 
for his opposition to territorialism and unionism, for his ecclesias- 
ticism and hierarchical tendencies. He was one of the founders of the 
Allgemeine Ev.-Luth. Konferenz. Kahnis (1814—1888) in his earlier 
career was a subordinationist and even departed radically from the 
doctrine of the Trinity, but in later years became much more con¬ 
servative, as his Lutherische Dogmatik reveals. Yet he continued to 
hold false views on inspiration and to dissent in the doctrine of the 
Trinity and of the Lord’s Supper. Philippi (1809—1882) took a very 
decided ^tand against modem subjectivism and in his Kirchliche 
Qlaubenslehre follows the dogmaticians of the orthodox age more

closely than Thomasius. One of the most important writers is 
Wm. Rohnert (+1902), who stands four-square upon Scripture as the 
one source and norm of all Christian theology, although he iB not 
correct in his doctrine of the election. Other men who might here 
be mentioned are Hase {Hutterus Redivivus ), — otherwise rational¬ 
istic,— Schmid ( Dogmatik der ev.-luth. Kirche — Lutheran), Hoppe 
(DogmatiJc des deutschen Protestantismus — Reformed), Schnecken- 
burger (Zur kirchlichen Christologie ), Martensen {Dogmatik) , who 
denied that Christ was inspired, Sartorius ( Die heilige Liebe), a ke- 
noticist, and Oettingen ( Die lutherische Dogmatik), who wrote in 
the spirit of the Erlangen school. 

The third group, or school, is that of the compromise theologians 
(the Halle school), representatives of which were found at practically 
all theological schools of Prussia. Kattenbusch says that these theo¬ 
logians may well be called the modern Philippists, whose tendencies 
were fashioned as a result of the “awakening,” or second surge of 
Pietism, as a consequence of which they combined “Biblicism” with 
a scientific attitude toward the Bible. In this group we may well place 
Hengstenberg (1802—1869), who was especially prominent in Old 
Testament exegesis and exerted a great influence through his editor¬ 
ship of the Evangelische Kirchenzeitung. He was opposed to ration¬ 
alism, but was himself not always trustworthy in his views, his alle¬ 
gorizing in particular often leading him into the errors of the Berle- 
burger Bibel. Nitzsch (1787—1868) is another mediating theologian, 
whose System der christlichen Lehre was strongly influenced by 
Schleiermacher’s subjectivism, just as he strongly favored the union 
of Lutherans and Reformed bodies. Tholuck (1799—1877), with all 
his apparent originality and undoubted brilliancy, was influenced by 
Pietism, Moravianism, Schleiermacher, Neander, and even Hegel. He 
assumed the possibility of errors in the Bible. Jul. Mueller (1801 
to 1878) is notable in particular for his Christliche Lehre von der 
Suende with its assumption of an intelligible (intellectual) self¬ 
decision and for his vacillating position concerning the Prussian 
union. Landerer (1810—1878) tried to mediate between Baur and 
Beck and constructed Christology along anthropocentric lines. 
Dorner (1809—1884) is rightly considered one of the most prominent 
theologians of the nineteenth century, his chief monograph being his 
Lehre von der Person Christi, in which unfortunately he presented 
a false kenosis doctrine. His Christology throughout is influenced by 
philosophy. Other men who may be said to belong to this group are 
Koestlin ( Luthers Theologie), Luecke ( Johannes-Kommentar), G-asz 
(Geschichte der protestantischen Dogmatik), and especially Rothe 
( Theologische Ethik), who takes a very critical position over against 
the Bible. 

The newer form of the Erlangen theology is represented by

Ihmels (t 1933), who is not adequate in a number of points in his 
doctrinal position, particularly because of his denying the sacrificial 
concept of Christ’s obedience unto death; R. Seeberg, who champions 
the “modem-positive” attitude toward theology, following Frank in 
many respects, so that he, like him, does not, e. g., quite accept the 
Gospel as an actual means of grace; J.Kunze (t 1927), who was 
a faithful disciple of Luthardt; Theodor Kaftan (f 1932), who denied 
the verbal inspiration; Beth, and others. Among the more recent 
theologians of the compromise or mediating school is Lemme (+ 1928), 
a pupil of Domer, M. Kaehler (+1912), Cremer (+1903), Zoeckler 
(t 1906), known especially for his Handbuch der theologischen Wissen- 
schaft, and Schnedermann. In the more liberal field we have the 
names of Lipsius (f 1892), Pfleiderer (f 1908), and Luedemann. 
German theologians who are at the present time studying the theology 
of Luther and the Lutheran Confessions with more or less pronounced 
success are Elert (Morphologie des Luthertums), Sommerlath, Doeme, 
Jelke, K. Schneider, Koeberle, Holl, Kurtz, and K. Stange. 

Meanwhile we also have a religio-historical school in Germany 
and elsewhere, with a fairly strong renascence of the ideas of Schleier- 
macher and Ritschl. Here we must place De Lagarde (f 1891), Over¬ 
beck (+ 1905), Ernst Troeltzsch (+ 1923), Aulen, and others. Of 
a more Ritschlian cast are Luettge, Mulert, Stephan, Titius, Wehrung, 
Wobbermin, and Fabricius, some of whom have also recast some of 
Schleiermacher’s ideas. Girgensohn (f 1925) is often called a confes¬ 
sional theologian, but his Orundriss is not at all adequate on many 
questions of Christology and soteriology. — Some of the more promi¬ 
nent writers in Stange’s Zeitschrift fuer systematische Theologie are 
P. Althaus, Jr., and E. Hirsch. The influence of A. v. Hamack 
(t 1930), a follower of Ritschl, and of R. Sohm (f 1917), is generally 
acknowledged. 

At the present time the following men are most prominent in the 
field of systematic theology in Germany: R. Otto, whose great mono¬ 
graph Das Heilige passed through twenty-two editions in fifteen years 
and was translated into seven languages; F. Heiler, who regards him¬ 
self as a spiritual disciple of W. Loehe and is influencing doctrine 
through his book The Spirit of Worship and his monthly journal 
Die Hochkirche; Karl Heim, a very prolific writer, who operates 
strongly with the element of introspection; Karl Barth, with his 
“dialectical theology” (a “combatant theology favoring vehement dis¬ 
cussion”), or “theology of crisis,” which opposes relativism and repre¬ 
sents a pessimism which practically denies the certainty of salvation; 
Oogarten, Thumeysen, and Brunner, who are closest to Barth, to¬ 
gether with 0. Piper. Among the Ritschlian eclectics of recent years 
are Martin Rade and Horst Stephan. The Northern countries have 
the following theologians: Goeransson, Nygren, Lindroth, Scharling,

In the general field of English theology few outstanding works 
were produced during the last century. Some of the more prominent 
writers of England in the field of doctrinal theology were Cobb, Christ¬ 
mas, Stuart, Lyddon, Gore, and Moule, with Sydney Cave as a repre¬ 
sentative of the extra-Anglican theology in the liberal field. Of Amer¬ 
ican writers in the field the names of the two Hodges (Presb.), father 
and son, deserve a prominent place; but the writings of Hopkins 
(Congr.), Hall, F. J. (Episc.), Shedd (Presb.), Clark (Episc.), Strong 
(Baptist), Sheldon (Meth. Episc.), Mackenzie (Congr.), and Knudson 
(Boston Univ.) are often quoted, while the field of social theology has 
strong exponents, such as Rauschenbusch, Sellars, Brown, De Witt, 
G. B. Smith, Clarke, Yedder, and others. This latter group may also 
be designated as Modernists, especially Brown, with men like Fosdick, 
Grant, and Cadman as other exponents. These men are really the 
new rationalists, except that they profess an adherence to the forms, 
and use the terms, of orthodox Christianity, which they have emptied 
of their real contents. 

Within the ranks of the Lutheran theologians of America not 
a few books in the field of doctrinal theology have appeared. In Latin 
we have Walther’s edition of Baier’s Compendium. In the English 
field we have the names of C. P. Krauth ( The Conservative Refor¬ 
mation), Weidner (various monographs), Valentine (not soundly Lu¬ 
theran), Voigt, Jacobs, Gerberding, Lindberg, Hove, Stump, Mellen- 
bruch, and Reu (English and German). The works of Hoenecke 
( Ev.-Luth . Dogmatik, thetical) and of F. Pieper ( Christliche Dog- 
matik, discussional) are soundly confessional and orthodox and are 
written with constant reference to late developments, especially in 
Germany. 

May the book which is herewith presented to the English-speaking 
theological world serve to arouse and maintain a new interest in the 
sound doctrine of Jesus Christ, the God-man and Savior of the world!

NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 

(De Batura et Constltutione Theologiae.) 


Introduction to Sacred Theology. 

( Prolegomena.) 


1. THE SCRIPTURAL VIEWPOINT OF THE CHRISTIAN 

THEOLOGIAN. 

Owing to the diverse views and tendencies prevailing among 
theologians to-day, it is necessary for the Christian theologian, 
before presenting to his readers his dogmatic treatise, to declare 
in clear and unmistakable terms from which viewpoint it has 
been written. 

The viewpoint of the present-day modernistic theologian is 
that truth must be determined by human reason in the light of 
scientific research. The theological Liberalist therefore does not 
recognize Holy Scripture as the source and norm of faith, but 
holds that this ancient standard of Christian doctrine has been 
superseded by the standards of reason and philosophy which he 
himself has established. From this viewpoint his dogmatic treatise 
is written, and since this viewpoint is anti-Scriptural and unchris¬ 
tian, it follows that his whole theology is rationalistic, naturalistic, 
and diametrically opposed to the Word of God. 

The viewpoint of the Roman Catholic theologian is that truth 
must be determined by both Holy Scripture and the “infallible” 
traditions of the Church as these are formally set forth in the papal 
decretals and decisions. Thus he accepts as a source and norm of 
faith, in addition to Holy Scripture (to which he falsely adds the 
Apocrypha), something that is foreign and even opposed to Holy 
Scripture and ascribes to it the same authority as to the Word 
of God. This erroneous viewpoint proves the antichristian char¬ 
acter of papistical theology; for it, too, is in direct opposition to 
Holy Scripture. 

The viewpoint of the modern rationalizing Protestant theo¬ 
logian is that, while Holy Scripture is indeed a “divine-human 
record of revealed truths,” which contains the doctrines that Chris¬ 
tians must believe for their salvation, these saving truths must be 
determined, not by any authoritative statement of the Scriptures,

CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS.

NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


but rather by the Christian “faith-consciousness” or the “regen¬ 
erate and sanctified mind” or the “Christian experience” of the 
theologian (das christliche Glaubensbewusstsein, das wiedergebome 
Ich, das christliche Erlehnis). In his opinion not the objective 
statement of Holy Scripture, but rather the “sanctified self- 
consciousness of the dogmatizing subject” (das fromme Selbst- 
bewusstsein des dogmatisierenden Subjects) is in the last analysis 
the norm which decides what is divine truth and what is not. 
Modern rationalistic theology is therefore a movement away from 
Holy Scripture (eine Los-von-der-Schrift-Bewegung) to a source 
and norm of faith established by man himself. This movement 
may differ in degree, but is always the same in kind. It is basically 
anti-Scriptural and has its source in the unbelief of the corrupt 
flesh. The viewpoint of the modern rationalistic theologian must 
therefore likewise be rejected as unchristian and opposed to Holy 
Scripture. 

The viewpoint from which the present dogmatic treatise is 
written is that Holy Scripture is the only source and norm of 
Christian faith and life, for the simple reason that the Bible is the 
divinely inspired Word of God, which is absolutely infallible and 
inerrant, both as a whole and in each individual passage. Hence, 
whenever it speaks on any point of doctrine or life, the matter is 
fully decided. Scriptura locuta, res decisa est. This viewpoint 
identifies Holy Scripture with the Word of God; its claim is, not 
merely that the Bible contains the Word of God, but that it is, 
fully and absolutely, in all its parts, the Word of God. 

The fact that this viewpoint is the only correct one is proved 
by the statements and the attitude of both Christ and His inspired 
apostles. Our divine Savior accepted no other norm than Holy 
Scripture, and He invariably rejected the traditions of the Phari¬ 
sees and the “reasonings” of the Sadducees. When He declared 
His divine doctrines and refuted errors. He constantly based His 
teachings on the immovable foundation of the written Word 
of God. Thus at the beginning of His ministry He met the temp¬ 
tations of Satan with the emphatic assertion “It is written,” Matt. 
4, 4, and He adhered to this principle throughout His ministry. 
Cp. John 5, 39; Matt. 5,17—19; John 8, 31. 32; etc. 

Also the apostles regarded Holy Scripture, including their 
own inspired teachings, both oral and written, as the sole source 
and norm of faith. Cf. Gal. 1, 8; 2 Tim. 3,15—17; Titus 1,9; 
1 Cor. 14, 37; 2 Pet. 1, 19—21; etc. When in the age of the

Reformation the Bible was restored to its rightful place as the sole 
authority of the Christian faith, Luther once more proclaimed it 
to be “the fountain of all wisdom.” (St. Louis Ed., I, 1289 ff.) 
The great Reformer declared: “You must believe that God Him¬ 
self speaks in the Bible, and your attitude must be in accordance 
with that belief.” (Ill, 21.) Those who, like the scholastic theo¬ 
logians, deviated from the Word of God and based their views and 
doctrines on the ground of reason or philosophy, were branded 
“monsters” (portenta) by Luther. The claim of modern rational¬ 
istic theologians that Luther’s attitude with regard to the authority 
of Holy Scripture was “rather free” (eine freiere Stellung) is dis¬ 
proved by his own clear and emphatic statements to the contrary. 
And like Luther all true Christian theologians have at all times 
maintained that the Bible is the inspired Word of God and there¬ 
fore the only source and norm of Christian faith, — a truth which 
they stoutly upheld against all gainsayers. 

Modern rationalistic theologians declare that they cannot 
identify Holy Scripture with the Word of God or accept it as the 
sole norm of faith. They aver that their sense of actuality 
(Wirklichkeitssinn) does not permit them to do so, but instead 
demands another norm outside and beyond Holy Scripture, for 
example, their “Christian consciousness,” their “Christian expe¬ 
rience,” and the like. In reality, however, this claim only goes 
to prove how gravely they are deceiving themselves; for the knowl¬ 
edge of divine truth can be gained only from the Word of God. 
The Christian faith therefore can be based solely upon God’s 
Word. Our divine Lord states emphatically that we shall know 
the truth only if we continue in His Word as proclaimed by Him¬ 
self and by His inspired prophets and apostles, John 8, 31. 32; 
17,20; Eph.2,20. 

How truly Christ has spoken the history of the Christian 
Church amply shows; for all theologians who at any time have 
rejected Holy Scripture as the sole norm of faith have invariably 
denied the specific Christian doctrines, such as the vicarious atone¬ 
ment of Christ, justification by grace through faith, etc. (Cf. Dr. F. 
Pieper, Christliche Dogmatik, Vol. I, 4 ff.) Thus Hofmann, the 
father of modern subjective theology (Ichtheologie), denied Christ’s 
vicarious satisfaction and taught the pagan theology of salvation 
without the redemptive work of Christ. It is, moreover, proved 
by the confusion of doctrine (Lehrverwirrung) which has resulted 
whenever the principle that Holy Scripture is the sole authority 
in religion has been either ignored or surrendered. This confusion 



4 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


in doctrine prevails whenever norms different from Holy Scripture 
are accepted as the basis of Christian doctrine; for subjective 
theology can never supply the Christian Church with a true and 
certain basis of faith. Without Holy Scripture as the sole source 
and standard of faith the Church is without any foundation what¬ 
soever on which it can rest its faith; it finds itself in a maelstrom 
of conflicting subjective views, all of which are fatal to the Chris¬ 
tian faith. 

2. OF RELIGION IN GENERAL. 

The etymology of the term religion is still a matter of 
controversy. The Lutheran dogmatician Hollaz writes: “Some 
suppose the term religion to be derived from religare (Lactan- 
tius), others from relegere (Cicero). According to the former 
derivation, religion signifies the obligation rightly to worship God 
or something which imposes upon man obligations and duties. 
According to the latter etymology, religion is diligent attention 
to those things which pertain to the worship of God. The former 
derivation is more generally received.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 21 .) l ) 
The Lutheran dogmatician Quenstedt cites as synonyms of relig¬ 
ion the Greek terms ftgrjoxeta, Jas. 1, 26; evoe^eia, 1 Tim. 4, 8 ; 
Xoyixij Xargeia, Rom. 12,1. However, none of these terms is really 
synonymous with religion, although each designates and emphasizes 
a particular phase of it. True religion is communion with the true 
God through faith in Jesus Christ; it is nothing more and nothing 
less. Still the controversy concerning the etymological meaning of 
religion need not trouble us, since in the final analysis the denota¬ 
tion of a word does not depend on its etymological derivation, but 
rather on its usage (usus loquendi). 

However, from the common usage of the term religion we can 
derive no satisfactory definition of religion if we desire to include 
both the Christian religion and the non-Christian religions. While 
both Christians and non-Christians employ the term religion, each 
of these groups connects with it its own specific concepts and 
meanings, and, as we shall see, these are contradictory. The matter 
deserves careful attention. 

Investigation shows that all heathen religions stand in direct 
opposition to the Christian religion. They are all, without excep¬ 
tion, religions of the Law. To the heathen, religion means the 
earnest endeavor of men to reconcile the deities by their own efforts

tr. by Jacobs and Hay.

or works, such as worship, sacrifices, moral conduct, asceticism, etc. 
In this respect all non-Christian religions agree, no matter how 
much they may differ in individual details. Nor can we expect 
anything else; for the heathen by nature do not know the Gospel 
(1 Cor. 2,6—10: “We speak . . . the hidden wisdom, . . . which 
none of the princes of this world knew”), but only the divine Law, 
namely, so far as this is written in their hearts. Hence all their 
religious thoughts move within the sphere of the Law, so that 
from beginning to end their religions are, and indeed must be, 
religions of the Law. 

Christians, on the contrary, believe true religion to consist in 
the very opposite. To Christians, religion means true faith in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, or in the gracious message, revealed in 
Holy Scripture, that a perfect reconciliation has been effected 
between God and man through the vicarious atonement (satisfactio 
vicaria) of the divine-human Christ, the Redeemer of the world. 
Hence religion in the true sense of the term may be ascribed only 
to believers in Christ Jesus. And that is precisely what God’s 
Word teaches on this point. True religion, according to God’s 
Word, is communion with God through faith in Jesus Christ. 
Thus St. Paul testifies: “Knowing that a man is not justified by 
the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we 
have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the 
faith of Christ and not by the works of the Law,” Gal. 2,16. 

Whenever theologians or entire denominations within external 
Christendom deny the cardinal doctrine of justification by grace, 
through faith in Christ, either in whole or in part, these indi¬ 
viduals or church-bodies surrender the Christian conception of 
religion and adopt the pagan view. They are apostates from the 
Christian faith, as St. Paul declares: “Christ is become of no effect 
unto you whosoever of you are justified by the Law; ye are fallen 
from grace,” Gal. 5, 4. In short, the doctrine of salvation by faith 
and that of salvation by works are opposites (opposita), which 
necessarily exclude each other, so that, if any one trusts in his 
works for salvation, he no longer in deed and truth professes the 
Christian religion. 

The basic difference between the Christian religion and all 
other so-called religions has been aptly pointed out by Prof. Max 
Mueller of Oxford University, who writes: “In the discharge of 
my duties for forty years as professor of Sanskrit in the University 
of Oxford I have devoted as much time as any man living to the

study of the sacred books of the East, and I have found the one 
key-note, the one diapason, so to speak, of all these so-called sacred 
books, . . . the one refrain through all — salvation by works. They 
all say that salvation must be purchased, must be bought with 
a price, and that the sole price, the sole purchase-money, must be 
our works and deservings. Our own Holy Bible, our sacred Book 
of the East, is from beginning to end a protest against this doctrine. 
Good works are indeed enjoined upon us in that sacred Book of 
the East; but they are only the outcome of a grateful heart; they 
are only a thank-offering, the fruits of our faith. They are never 
the ransom-money of the true disciples of Christ. Let us not shut 
our eyes to what is excellent and true and of good report in these 
sacred books; but let us teach Hindus, Buddhists, and Moham¬ 
medans that there is only one sacred Book of the East that can 
be their mainstay in that awful hour when they pass all alone into 
the unseen world. It is the sacred Book which contains that 
faithful saying, worthy to be received of all men, women, and 
children, and not merely of us Christians, that Christ Jesus came 
into the world to save sinners.” (Cf. Pieper, Christliche Dog- 
matik, I, 15 ff.) 

3. OF THE NUMBER OF RELIGIONS IN THE WORLD. 

The number of religions in the world has been variously 
estimated. We commonly speak of four different religions: Chris¬ 
tian, Jewish, Mohammedan, and pagan. While such an enumera¬ 
tion may be employed in common speech, it must never be for¬ 
gotten that in the final analysis all religions must be reduced to 
two classes: religions of the Law , that is, religions which endeavor 
to reconcile the Deity by works of the Law; and the religion of the 
Gospel, that is, the belief, divinely wrought and engendered by 
the Holy Ghost through the means of grace, that God has been 
reconciled to the sinner without any works on his part, through 
the vicarious atonement of Christ Jesus, and that salvation is 
thus God’s free gift, appropriated by the sinner through faith in 
Christ Jesus. 

This division of religions into two distinct and mutually ex¬ 
clusive groups is truly in accordance with Scripture. Holy Writ 
acknowledges as true religion only that which teaches that the 
sinner is saved through faith in Christ. It distinctly declares it to 
be the mission of the Christian Church to displace all man-made 
religions and to establish throughout the world the religion of the 
saving Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our Lord’s Great Commission 



NATtJBE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY.

reads: “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every 
creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he 
that believeth not shall be damned,” Mark 16,15.16. To St. Paul 
the glorified Savior said: I am sending thee to the Gentiles “to 
open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from 
the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of 
sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that 
is in Me,” Acts 26,17.18. According to this express statement of 
Holy Writ all who do not believe the Gospel are kept in darkness 
and in the power of Satan, from which they can be delivered only 
through sanctification by faith. 

Thus the Word of God recognizes only the Christian religion 
as true and as capable of bringing salvation to men; it alone de¬ 
serves the name of religion since it alone reunites sinful man with 
God. If man-made forms of worship are called religions, this 
term is applied to them in an improper sense, just as idols are 
termed “Gods” although in reality they are not Gods. Since this 
is the case, it is impossible to find a general religious concept or 
definition by which all religions existing in the world, both the 
true and the false, may be grouped in a single class. Christianity, 
by its very origin, does not belong in the category of man-made 
religions. 

All who deny this and maintain that such a general religious 
concept or definition can be established overlook the essential dif¬ 
ference between the religion of Christ and religions of human 
origin. Religion has been defined as “the personal relation of man 
to God.” This definition, it has been asserted, is broad enough to 
include both the Christian religion and the pagan religions. How¬ 
ever, its inadequacy becomes apparent as we begin to analyze 
“man’s relation to God.” Since all men are sinners, their relation 
to God by nature is that of fear and despair and, consequently, of 
hatred toward God. This miserable condition is attested both by 
Scripture and experience. According to the clear teaching of 
God’s Word all men who are not born again through faith in 
Christ are “without Christ,” “have no hope,” and are “without 
God in the world,” Eph. 2,12. In spite of their earnest endeavors 
to reconcile God by their works they continue in their fear and 
hopelessness; for they remain under the curse and condemnation 
of the divine Law. This fact St. Paul asserts when he writes: “As 
many as are of the works of the Law are under the curse,” 
Gal. 3,10. The same apostle declares also that “the things which 
the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to God,” 1 Cor.

10, 20. In short, as long as a person is without faith in Christ, his 
personal relation to God is a relation of dread, despair, and hope¬ 
lessness and therefore also of enmity against God, Rom. 8, 7. 

However, the personal relation to God changes as soon as 
a person becomes a child of God through faith in Christ; then he 
obtains “a good conscience,” 1 Pet. 3, 21, the assurance of divine 
grace, the conviction that his sins are forgiven, and the inestimable 
hope of eternal life. “If any man be in Christ, he is a new crea¬ 
ture; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become 
new,” 2 Cor. 5,17. St. Paul describes this blessed relationship in 
beautiful terms Rom. 5,1. 2, where he writes: “Therefore, being 
justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace 
wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.” And 
again, v. 11: “We also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
by whom we have now received the atonement.” The believer's 
personal relation to God is therefore the very opposite of the per¬ 
sonal relation to God which is found in the unbeliever; it is a re¬ 
lation of peace, joy, and happiness. 

Again, religion has been defined as “the method of worshiping 
God.” This definition is quite adequate as far as the Christian 
religion is concerned, but as a definition of religion in general it is 
woefully inadequate, since all non-Christian religions are certainly 
not “methods of worshiping God.” True worship of God is possible 
only through faith in Christ, as our Lord emphatically tells us 
when He declares: “All men should honor the Son even as they 
honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the 
Father, which hath sent Him,” John 5, 23. Every “worship of 
God” without Christ dishonors God; therefore, far from being 
worship of God, it is in reality blasphemy and opposition to God. 
Indeed, it is devil-worship, as St. Paul declares: “The things which 
the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to God,” 
1 Cor. 10, 20. In these words the apostle affirms in no uncertain 
terms that the heathen cannot worship the true God. Though 
they be ever so earnest in their endeavor to placate their deities, 
their worship is a service of devils. 

The reason for this is clear. All non-Christian religions err 
with regard to the object as well as to the method of worship. 
The heathen worship objects that are not divine and thus give the 
glory belonging to God to another and His praise to graven images. 
Is. 42, 8. Such blasphemous worship is an abomination in the

eight of God and therefore the very opposite of true worship. But 
the non-Christian religions are in error also with respect to the 
method of worship. Since the heathen are ignorant of the divine 
Savior of men and therefore do not know that they must trust in 
Him for salvation, they seek to quiet their consciences whenever 
these are aroused to a consciousness of sin and guilt, and to recon¬ 
cile the objects of their worship, by good works. But reliance on 
good works for justification offends God and provokes Him to 
anger. “As many as are of the works of the Law are under the 
curse,” Gal. 3,10. That is God’s verdict, His own condemnation 
of a worship offered to Him on the basis of human merit. 

In short, religion in general cannot be defined as “the method 
of worshiping God”; for that definition is applicable only to the 
Christian religion, not to any other. This fact has been deci¬ 
sively asserted by our Lutheran dogmaticians. Hollaz writes: 
“Religion, improperly speaking, signifies the false; properly speak¬ 
ing, the true method of worshiping God.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 22.) 
This distinction is as vital as it is correct. 

Recently religion has been defined also as “the endeavor of 
man to secure, supplement, and perfect personal and social life 
with the aid of a higher, supernatural power.” This endeavor, 
the German theologian Kirn avers, is common to all religions, so 
that it supplies us with a general concept for the definition of 
religion. However, this definition applies only to the religions of 
the Law, or the non-Christian religions, which certainly endeavor 
to “secure, supplement, and perfect personal life” through human 
efforts and works. It is the common denominator of all religions 
outside of Christianity; the erroneous opinion that a man must 
save himself by good deeds (opinio legis) is inherent by nature in 
all men. The Christian religion, however, differs radically from 
this false notion. In fact, from beginning to end it is a protest 
against the false doctrine that a man must “secure, supplement, 
and perfect life” by his own efforts. It rejects altogether the doc¬ 
trine of work-righteousness and establishes as its prime and basic 
principle the fact that a sinner is justified by grace alone, without 
the deeds of the Law. It is largely because of this vast divergence 
between the Christian religion and the religions of work-righteous¬ 
ness that the Gospel of Christ is a stumbling-block to the Jew and 
foolishness to the Greek, 1 Cor. 1, 23; 2,14. Man, blinded by sin, 
does not desire a way to salvation that is purely by grace, through 
faith in a divine Savior. 



10 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


It is evident from the foregoing that Christianity, since it is 
the only true religion, dare not be placed in the same class with 
man-made religions. There is no general religious concept or 
definition that embraces the distinctive tenets of Christianity and 
of the man-made religions; Christianity is quite in a class by itself. 
It alone is the true religion, while all the others are counterfeit; 
and just as little as counterfeit coin is real money, so little can 
man-made religions substantiate their claim of being real religions. 
If the term religion is applied to them, it is done in a wholly 
improper sense. If we do designate them as “religions,” we do it 
in the same sense in which we term counterfeit coins “money” or 
in which Holy Scripture applies to the heathen idols the term 
“gods” (D'iihjt). The application of the name in this case never 
means that the object thus designated is in reality that which the 
name expresses. The heathen idols are not Gods, nor are the 
heathen forms of worship religions in the true sense of the term. 

Quenstedt accordingly writes (I, 28): “The term religion is 
used either improperly and falsely (abusive) or properly. Improp¬ 
erly and falsely it is used for false religion, namely, for the heathen, 
the Mohammedan, and the Jewish religions, in which sense Calix- 
tus, in the Theological Apparatus, treats of the divers religions of 
the world, in spite of the fact that there is only one true religion, 
namely, the Christian.” In keeping with this doctrine our Lu¬ 
theran dogmaticians never sought a general religious concept or 
definition to comprehend both the Christian and the non-Chris¬ 
tian religions, but placed the Christian religion in a class by itself 
as the only religion and classed all others as false and as unworthy 
of the name. This classification alone is Scriptural. 

But here the objection has been raised that the old orthodox 
dogmaticians were devoid of an adequate psychological, philosoph¬ 
ical, and historical understanding of the various non-Christian relig¬ 
ions and that for this reason it is clear why they failed to appreciate 
these forms of worship. This lack of appreciation, it is maintained, 
has been supplied by modern research work in the psychology of 
religion, the philosophy of religion, and in comparative religion 
(Religionsgeschichte). Yet, as we shall see, even the results of 
these investigations do not disprove the correctness of the old dual 
division of religions into the true and the false. 

Modern religious psychology endeavors to point out “the simi¬ 
larity of the psychological phenomena” (die Oleichartigkeit der 
psychologischen Erscheinungen) found in both the Christian re-

ligion and the non-Christian religions. This similarity, it is said, 
was overlooked by the older theologians, and their inability to 
find a general concept or definition to cover both the Christian 
religion and the non-Christian religions is attributable to this fact. 
However, we may state in reply to this charge that, after all, the 
psychological phenomena of the Christian religion and of the non- 
Christian religions are not similar at all; in fact, essentially they 
are diametrically opposed to each other. In the heart of the non- 
Christian we commonly find such “psychological phenomena” as 
the consciousness of guilt, an accusing and condemning conscience, 
fear of punishment, flight from God, and an inward hatred of 
Him — and all these coupled with the constant desire to placate 
the Deity by good works. But since good works cannot reconcile 
God, we find in addition the “psychological phenomena” of terror 
of death, hopelessness, and despair. These “psychological phe¬ 
nomena” are clearly attested by Holy Scripture, Eph. 2,12: “hav¬ 
ing no hope”; Heb. 2,15: “who through fear of death were all 
their lifetime subject to bondage.” The candid confessions of 
honest and earnest heathen thinkers emphatically confirm what 
Holy Scripture teaches on this point; they all reecho the tragic 
note of spiritual despair as they contemplate human sinfulness 
and guilt. 

However, in the soul of the believing child of God we find the 
very opposite “psychological phenomena,” such as the consciousness 
of guilt removed and of sin forgiven, peace with God (Rom. 5, 
1—3), filial love of God and implicit trust in His grace, triumph 
over death, and the sure hope of eternal life. And all these 
“psychological phenomena” are combined with the consecrated de¬ 
sire to serve God in deed and in truth, out of heartfelt gratitude 
for His unmerited gift of grace. Gal. 2, 20: “The life which I now 
live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved 
me and gave Himself for me.” St. Paul affirms the diversity of 
the “psychological phenomena” which he experienced before and 
after his conversion. He writes, 1 Cor. 15, 9.10: “I persecuted the 
Church of God; but by the grace of God I am what I am.” 
Furthermore, in order to assure his readers of the blessedness of 
their Christian calling, he continually directs their attention to 
the diversity of the “psychological experiences” which they had 
undergone, first as benighted heathen and afterward as enlightened 
Christians. Eph. 2, 5: “Even when we were dead in sins, hath 
[He] quickened us together with Christ.” Cf. Eph. 2, 11—22; 
1 Cor. 12,2. 27; etc. 



12 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


The similarity of the “psychological phenomena” which 
modern students of religious psychology assert so strongly is only 
a formal, not a material, similarity. Thus, both Christians and 
heathen engage in worship; yet how radically different is their 
worship in all its essentials! Christians pray, and so do the 
heathen; yet what a vast difference there is between the Christian 
and the pagan prayer! Hence religious psychology, too, cannot 
deny the essential difference between the Christian and the non- 
Christian religions and must therefore a dmi t that the dual division 
of religions into the true and the false is correct. 

The same holds true of the historical study of religion. Com¬ 
parative religion (Religionsgeschichte) demonstrates the fact that 
all religions outside the Christian religion are “religions of the 
Law,” or “religions of works,” maintaining as their basic principle 
that man must earn his salvation by worthy deeds. The glad 
tidings of salvation by grace through faith, on the other hand, 
is found in the Bible only, not in any other so-called book of 
religion. Thus the historical study of religion also can establish 
no other division of religions than that of the Lutheran dogma- 
ticians, who placed in the first group the Christian religion, which 
teaches salvation by grace, and in the second group all man-made 
religions, which teach salvation by works. “Work-religions” may 
differ in non-essential details, which depend on climatic, psycho¬ 
logical, and racial factors, but they all agree in the common funda¬ 
mental principle of salvation by works. 

Finally, the philosophical study of religion, or philosophy of 
religion, also cannot lead us beyond the dual division of religions 
in two distinct kinds, the one true and the other false. The student 
of religious philosophy can, of course, operate only with the natural 
knowledge of God, or the divine Law written in the heart of man. 
But when he does define religion on purely natural premises, that 
is, when he views religion wholly apart from divine revelation, his 
conclusion must necessarily be that religion is essentially man’s 
effort to reconcile God on the basis of meritorious conduct. Thus 
Socrates, the greatest of Greek philosophers, although he surpassed 
all the others by the loftiness and sublimity of his philosophico- 
religious ideas, nevertheless demanded that in the hour of his 
death a cock be sacrificed to Aesculapius. Socrates conceived the 
need of a savior far greater than any possible human savior; yet 
since the true Savior was unknown to him, he was obliged to trust 
in his works for salvation. Also Immanuel Kant, who is commonly 
regarded as the foremost religious philosopher and is still the 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


13 


greatest of all modern philosophers, affirmed that from the view¬ 
point of pure philosophy the essence of religion must be regarded 
as “morality” and that the Christian doctrine of the atonement 
can have no place in any speculative system of religion. Religious 
philosophy must therefore always conceive of religion as the effort 
of man to win salvation by works. Thus the dual division of re¬ 
ligions established by Christian divines of bygone centuries must 
be retained even to-day. 

There is, however, a system of religious philosophy which 
seeks to build up its rationalistic speculations on the basis of Holy 
Scripture. The advocates of this type of religious philosophy 
admit that the revealed truths of Holy Scripture lie beyond the 
intellectual comprehension of man. For this reason these must 
be believed and accepted as true a priori. Yet the theologian 
should not remain satisfied with this simple act of believing. 
Through faith in the divine truths of revelation he must progress 
to their intellectual apprehension. What the ordinary believer 
knows by faith the theologian must understand. So Anselm of 
Canterbury, the father of medieval scholasticism, declared: “Credo, 
ut intelligam” Anselm’s purpose, in a way, was laudable. He 
sought to meet and refute the skeptics of his time, who a priori 
rejected the revealed truths as false because they are unintelligible 
to human reason. Anselm demanded that the revealed truths 
should first be believed in order that they might be dialectically 
demonstrated and rationally understood. His underlying principle 
was that “a Christian through faith must progress to understand¬ 
ing and not through understanding to faith.” “Christianus per 
/idem debet ad intellectual proficere, non per intellectual ad fidem 
accedere.” The disciples of Anselm are the modern advocates of 
“scientific theology,” falsely so called, who, like their medieval 
teacher, assert that faith must be elevated to knowledge, because 
only in this way the Christian religion can be perceived and demon¬ 
strated as the absolute truth. 

This endeavor, however, to harmonize faith with reason is 
unscriptural. Jesus assures us that we shall know the truth only 
if we continue in His Word by faith, John 8, 31. 32. In the same 
spirit, St. Paul asserts that all teachers of the Church who do 
not adhere to the truth of Christ Jesus by simple faith are “proud, 
knowing nothing, but doting,” 1 Tim. 6, 3. 4. Thus both Christ 
and St. Paul are opposed to the endeavor of “scientific theologians” 
to elevate faith to knowledge and the revealed truth to a human 



14 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


science. The reason for this is evident. The Christian religion 
cannot be brought down to the level of man’s intellectual compre¬ 
hension without losing its supernatural character and content. 
History shows very plainly how fatal the endeavor to “elevate” 
faith to knowledge has proved itself. Anselm denied the active 
obedience of Christ, Abelard denied His vicarious atonement, and 
in recent times the adherents of “scientific theology” have denied 
both the divine inspiration of Holy Scripture and the justification 
of a sinner by grace, through faith in Christ. Thus both the 
formal and the material principles of Christianity have been denied, 
and the whole Christian religion has been eviscerated of its divinely 
revealed content. The ultimate consequence of the application of 
philosophy to theology is Modernism or agnosticism. 

Incidentally, also this last consideration proves the correct¬ 
ness of the dual division of religions into the true and the false; 
for the content of the Christian religion is of such a nature that 
it is either completely received by faith or is completely rejected, 
since the mysteries of revealed truth are not recognized as such 
by human reason. The perverted reason of man acknowledges as 
true only the religion of the Law, or of works, while with all its 
might it contends against the religion of faith. On the other 
hand. Holy Scripture condemns as false all religions of works, 
just as it declares unregenerate human reason to be blind, dead, 
and absolutely unable to perceive the things of the Spirit of God, 
1 Cor. 2,14. 

4. THE TWO SOURCES (PRINCIPIA COGNOSCENDI) 

OF THE EXISTING RELIGIONS. 

As we have seen, there are but two essentially different re¬ 
ligions, the religion of faith, or of the Gospel, and the religion of 
works, or of the Law. So also there are but two actual sources 
(principia cognoscendi, principles of knowledge) from which these 
two divergent religions are taken. The religion of works is of 
human origin; it is a man-made religion, having its source and 
origin in the human heart, in which God has inscribed His divine 
Law, so that also the heathen, who have not the Word of God 
as set forth in Holy Scripture, Rom. 2,14, “know the judgment of 
God” (dixatco/xa, the norm of right, Rechtssatzung ), Rom. 1, 32, 
and “show the work of the Law written in their hearts,” Rom. 2,15. 
On the basis of the divine Law, inscribed in the human heart, 
conscience accuses and condemns man whenever he does wrong, 
and so he is burdened with the consciousness of guilt, “they are

15 


without excuse,” Eom. 1, 20, “their conscience also bearing wit¬ 
ness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing 
one another,” Eom. 2,15. 

Thus condemned by his conscience, man seeks to reconcile the 
Deity by “good works,” such as worship, sacrifices, etc. The 
Apology rightly says: “But works become conspicuous among men. 
Human reason naturally admires these, and because it sees only 
works and does not understand or consider faith, it dreams accord¬ 
ingly that these works merit remission of sins and justify. This 
opinion of the Law (haec opinio legis) inheres by nature in men’s 
minds; neither can it be expelled, unless when we are divinely 
taught. But the mind must be recalled (revocanda mens est) from 
such carnal opinions of the Word of God.” (Art. Ill, 197.) 

The “opinion of the Law” of which the Apology here speaks, 
namely, the erroneous view that works merit remission of sins and 
justify the sinner, St. Paul calls “the religion of the flesh.” So 
he writes to the Galatians, who sought justification on the ground 
of their merits: “Are ye so foolish ? Having begun in the Spirit, 
are ye now made perfect by the flesh ?” Gal. 3, 3. Luther correctly 
explains this passage as follows: “Here flesh is nothing else than 
the righteousness, the wisdom, of the flesh and the thoughts of 
reason, which endeavors to be justified by the Law.” (St. L. Ed., 
IX, 288 ff.) That this is indeed the meaning of the word flesh in 
this passage the context clearly proves. The passage thus teaches 
the truth that every religion which seeks to acquire divine grace and 
remission of sins through human endeavors is not of God, but 
of man. Its source is the perverted, unregenerate heart. 

The religion of the Gospel, or of faith, on the contrary, is 
not of man, but of God, who has revealed it by His inspired 
prophets and apostles in Holy Scripture. 1 Cor. 2, 6—10: “We 
speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom 
of this world; . . . but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, 
even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto 
our glory; which none of the princes of this world knew. . . . But 
as it is written, Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have 
entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared 
for them that love Him. But God hath revealed them unto us 
by His Spirit,” etc. 

The religion of faith is therefore in the strictest sense of the 
term “wisdom of God,” 1 Cor. 1, 24. It is “God-made,” and its 
only source is God’s Book, the inspired Scriptures, John 5, 39; 
Eom. 16, 25. 26; Eph. 2, 20; 1 John 1, 4. Quenstedt writes 



16 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


(I, 33): “The sole, proper, adequate, and ordinary source of 
theology and of the Christian religion is the divine revelation con¬ 
tained in the Holy Scriptures; or, what is the same, the canonical 
Scriptures alone are the absolute source of theology, so that out 
of them alone the articles of faith are to be deduced and proved.” 
Again, I, 36: “Divine revelation is the first and last source of 
sacred theology, beyond which theological discussion among Chris¬ 
tians dare not proceed.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 127 ff.) This Scrip¬ 
tural truth must be maintained against every form of rationalism, 
by which at all times false teachers have sought to pervert the 
divine truth. Rationalistic doctrine (Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagi- 
anism, synergism, etc.) is not of God, but carnal, anti-Scriptural 
opposition to God. Essentially it is paganism, which destroys 
divine truth wherever it is accepted and allowed to hold sway in 
theology. Quenstedt is right when he writes (I, 38) : “Human or 
natural reason is not the source of theology and supernatural 
things.” {Doctr. Theol., p. 28.) 

But neither is tradition a source of the Christian faith. Calov 
is fully in accord with Holy Scripture when he declares: “We con¬ 
tend that over and above the written Word of God there is at 
present no unwritten Word of God concerning any doctrine neces¬ 
sary to Christian faith and life, not comprehended in the Scrip¬ 
tures, that ever came forth from the apostles, was handed down by 
tradition, was preserved by the Church, and is to be received with 
equal reverence.” {Doctr. Theol., p. 28.) This is truly Lutheran 
and Scriptural doctrine. We are to seek God’s Word only in God’s 
Book, never anywhere else, as also Quenstedt emphatically states 
when he writes (I, 44): “The consent of the primitive Church or 
of the Fathers of the first centuries after Christ is not a source of 
Christian faith, neither primary nor secondary, nor does it produce 
a divine, but merely a human or probable belief.” {Doctr. Theol., 

p. 28.) 

Lastly we must reject also the so-called private revelations as 
sources of faith; for, as Hollaz rightly points out, “after the 
completion of the canon of Scripture no new and immediate divine 
revelation was given to be a fundamental source of doctrine, 1 Cor. 
4, 6; Heb. 1 , 1.” {Doctr. Theol., p. 28.) 

The doctrine of a fixed revelation, that is, of a divine revela¬ 
tion given us only in the Word of Christ and His prophets and 
apostles, is plainly the doctrine of Scripture. Eph. 2,20: “And 
[ye] are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,

Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Corner-stone.” For this 
reason Christian theology, on the basis of Holy Scripture, can 
acknowledge only one source and standard of true religion, namely, 
the inspired, infallible written Word of God, or Holy Scripture. 

The religion of faith dates back to the beginning of the Old 
Testament, since it was revealed to Adam and Eve immediately 
after the Fall, Gen. 3, 15. It was afterwards proclaimed con¬ 
tinually by the holy prophets and was truly believed by all the 
Old Testament saints. Gen. 15, 6: “And he [Abram] believed in 
the Lord; and He counted it to him for righteousness.” In the 
New Testament both Christ and His apostles constantly point back 
to the promises of faith revealed in the Old Testament. Luke 
24, 27: “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He ex¬ 
pounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning 
Himself.” Acts 10, 43: “To Him give all the prophets witness 
that through His name, whosoever believeth in Him, shall receive 
remission of sins.” Eom. 3, 21: “But now the righteousness of 
God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law 
and the Prophets.” Rom. 4, 3: “Abraham believed God, and it 
was counted unto him for righteousness.” All these passages con¬ 
firm the truth that also in the Old Testament men were saved 
solely through the true religion of faith in Christ. The divine 
Law never had the function to save sinners; its chief purpose is 
to convince sinners of their sin and guilt. Gal. 3,24: “Wherefore 
the Law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we 
might be justified by faith.” Rom. 3, 20; 7, 7. 

5. THE CAUSE OF DIVISIONS IN CHRISTENDOM. 

Since all non-Christian religions are man-made, having their 
source in man’s endeavor to earn remission of sins by works, it is 
not strange that they should appear in many and diverse forms. 
The Apology writes: “And because no works pacify the conscience, 
new works, in addition to God’s commands, were from time to 
time devised (the hypocrites nevertheless used to invent one work 
after another, one sacrifice after another, by a blind guess and in 
reckless wantonness, and all this without the Word and command 
of God, with wicked conscience, as we have seen in the Papacy).” 
(Art. Ill, 87.) This statement the Apology applies, first of all, to 
the papists, but it holds true with respect to all the religions of 
works. Just because the old works never pacify the guilty con¬ 
science, new works must be tried to effect a cure of the sin-troubled

conscience; and so in all man-made religions there is an endless 
multiplication of “good works.” 

However, while divisions may thus be expected among the 
adherents of man-made religions, one preferring this good work 
and another that, so that each pagan sect has its own forms of 
worship as well as its own gods, there ought not to be any divisions 
among the adherents of the religion of faith, since this religion has 
only one source of doctrine, namely, Holy Scripture, which by its 
divine message of grace satisfies the human heart and appeases 
the human conscience by offering free remission of sins to all who 
believe in Christ. In other words, Christians having the one Word 
of God and holding to the one faith in Christ ought not to be split 
into factions, or parties. 

In addition to this, Holy Scripture very sternly condemns all 
divisions, demanding that all believers should “endeavor to keep 
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,” Eph. 4, 3. St. Paul 
states the reason for this demand very clearly when he adds 
(vv. 4—6) : “There is one body and one Spirit, even as ye are 
called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one Bap¬ 
tism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all,, 
and in you all.” The divisions existing at Corinth so horrified 
Paul that he wrote: “Is Christ divided?” 1 Cor. 1, 13. All be¬ 
lievers in Christ are equally members of His body, and so there is 
no cause whatever for any possible division in the Christian Church. 

Yet such divisions exist, and they have existed since the first 
proclamation of the Christian faith, so that there always have been 
sects within the visible Church. These divisions have been vari¬ 
ously explained by climatic or racial differences, under the plea 
that the peoples of the various zones are variously affected in their 
religious emotions. However, all these explanations are inadequate 
and even false; they are disproved by the simple fact that true 
believers in Christ who actually do keep the unity of the Spirit 
in the bond of peace are found the world over, no matter what 
kind of climatic or racial differences may exist among men. 

No indeed! The origin and the existence of divisions within 
Christendom are to be attributed to more serious causes. Accord¬ 
ing to Holy Scripture they are due to false prophets and apostles, 
who, unfaithful to the pure Word of God, in the name of the 
Christian religion disseminate their own perverse notions and dis¬ 
card the specific beliefs of Christianity, above all the fundamental 
doctrine of the Gospel that man is justified by grace, through faith,.

without the deeds of the Law. Such pseudapostles troubled even 
the churches founded by Paul and his colaborers. Rom. 16,17: 
“I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and 
offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid 
them.” 1 Cor. 14, 37: “If any man think himself to be a prophet 
or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto 
vou are the commandments of the Lord.” Gal. 1, 6—8: “I marvel 
that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you into the 
grace of Christ unto another gospel. . . . But there be some that 
trouble you and would pervert the Gospel of Christ. But though 
we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than 
that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” 
Phil. 3,18: “For many walk of whom I have told you often, and 
now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cross 
of Christ.” The malicious attempts of such pseudapostles to per¬ 
vert the Gospel of Christ, in particular the central doctrine of 
Christianity: salvation by grace alone, through faith in the 
vicarious atonement of the divine Redeemer, explain for all time 
the existence of divisions within Christendom. 

The truth of this assertion becomes obvious when we examine 
the major divisions existing within the Christian Church: the 
Romanistic division, the Reformed division, various divisions with¬ 
in the Lutheran Church, and the modern rationalistic schools of 
theology with their innumerable ramifications. 

The Roman Catholic Church, while in principle acknowl¬ 
edging the divine authority of Holy Scripture, nevertheless insists 
that the Bible must be interpreted according to the decisions 
of the Church, which, in the final analysis, are those of the Pope, 
who, as Luther points out in the Smalcald Articles (Part III, 
Art. VIII, 4), claims to have all rights within the shrine of his 
heart (in scrinio pectoris). The result of such interpretation of 
Holy Scripture according to the sense of the “holy Mother Church” 
(sancta mater ecclesia) is that the cardinal article of the Christian 
faith, the doctrine of justification by grace alone, through faith in 
Christ, is not only rejected, but expressly anathematized, so that 
all true Christians who base their hope of salvation solely on Christ 
Jesus and not also on their works and on the merits of the saints 
are pronounced accursed. ( Council of Trent, Sess. VI, Cans. 11. 
12. 20.) Thus the Romanistic division, or sect, deprives the Chris¬ 
tian religion of its specific character and content, and its whole 
theology is, as St. Paul styles it, “a religion of the flesh.” 



20 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OP THEOLOGY. 


Romanism is built upon two fundamental errors, which Holy 
Scripture most stringently condemns: the infallibility of papal 
authority in religion and the meritoriousness of man’s good works. 
It is above all these two errors that make the Church of Rome 
an antichristian sect. 

The Reformed faction likewise acknowledges the divine 
authority of Holy Scripture in principle. In fact, over against 
Lutheranism the Reformed Church makes the claim that it is 
“more exclusively Scriptural” than the Lutheran Church, which, 
it says, has always been inclined to be “historical” and “conserva¬ 
tive” in accord with the principle that church traditions and 
customs may be retained whenever they can be reconciled with 
the Word of God. But this distinction between Reformed and 
Lutheran theology is not based on facts. Reformed theology is 
not “more exclusively Scriptural” than Lutheran theology. On 
the contrary; while Romanistic theology demands the interpreta¬ 
tion of Holy Scripture according to the sancta mater ecclesia. 
Reformed theology insists that the Bible must be interpreted 
according to human reason, or according to rationalistic axioms. 

Thus, guided by rationalistic axioms, Reformed theology re¬ 
jects, first of all, the doctrine of the means of grace, that is, the 
doctrine that the Word of God and the Sacraments are the divinely 
ordained means by which the Holy Ghost directly works regenera¬ 
tion, conversion, and sanctification. The doctrine of the means of 
grace is clearly stated in Holy Scripture, Rom. 1,16; Titus 3, 5. 6; 
Acts 2, 38, etc. But in opposition to this Scriptural truth Reformed 
theology asserts the rationalistic axiom that “efficacious grace acts 
immediately.” In other words, Reformed theology separates the 
sanctifying operations of the Holy Ghost from the means of grace 
under the plea that the Holy Spirit needs no vehicle by which to 
enter the hearts of men. (Zwingli, Fidei Ratio; Calvin, Inst., IV, 
14.17; Hodge, Syst.Theol., II, 684; etc.) It was this rational¬ 
istic axiom, consistently and strenuously applied, which caused the 
division between the Lutheran Church and the Reformed sects. 
Against Romanism, Luther had to defend the truth that the Word 
of God must not be perverted by the rationalistic views of the 
“Church”; against Zwinglianism he had to defend the truth that 
the Word of God must not be perverted by the rationalistic views 
of individual theologians. 

Again, Reformed theology applies a rationalistic principle 
when it treats the doctrines of the person of Christ and of the

Lord’s Supper. It emphatically denies the real presence of Christ’s 
body in the Lord’s Supper, maintaining that His presence in the 
Sacrament is only spiritual, that is, a presence effected by the faith 
of the believer. In other words, Christ is present in Holy Com¬ 
munion only to the extent that the believing communicant is 
united with Him by faith. This denial of the Real Presence 
is manifestly in opposition to the clear words of Christ’s institution 
of the Holy Supper: “Take, eat; this is My body.” It rests solely 
on the rationalistic principle that Christ’s body, being a truly 
human body and having as such only a visible and local mode of 
presence (visibilis et localis praesentia), cannot be truly present in 
the Lord’s Supper because it is locally enclosed in heaven. That 
is to say, moved by human reason, Reformed theology denies the 
illocal mode of presence of Christ’s body, taught in such passages 
as John 20,19: “When the doors were shut, . . . came Jesus and 
stood in the midst”; Luke 24, 31: “And He vanished out of their 
sight,” etc. 

Holy Scripture ascribes this illocal presence of Christ’s human 
nature to Him by virtue of the personal union with its resulting 
communion of the two natures and the communication of attri¬ 
butes. But on the basis of reason Reformed theology denies the 
communion of the two natures of Christ and the communication 
of attributes. It asserts that “the finite is not capable of the 
infinite.” From this rationalistic principle follows another, 
namely, that Christ’s body cannot have an illocal presence and 
since the Ascension is therefore enclosed in heaven. The split 
between Zwinglianism and Lutheranism must be attributed to the 
maintenance and defense of these two rationalistic axioms on the 
part of the former. Luther was unable to extend to Zwingli the 
hand of Christian fellowship at Marburg (1529) because the latter 
showed a “different spirit,” namely, the spirit of rationalism, which 
is diametrically opposed to the Christian faith. 

Lastly, Calvinistic theology denies the universality of divine 
grace (gratia universalis) and teaches that the grace of God is par¬ 
ticular (gratia particularis), i. e., that it does not embrace all men, 
but the elect only, while all others are eternally predestinated to 
perdition. This doctrine is in direct opposition to Holy Scripture, 
which throughout affirms the universality of God’s grace and, 
besides, asserts that the damnation of a sinner is not due to any 
failure on the part of God to provide for his salvation, John 1, 29; 
3, 16 ff.; 1 John 1, 2; 1 Tim. 2, 4—6; etc. On what grounds, 



22 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


then, does Reformed theology deny the universality of divine grace ? 
Here again it employs a rationalistic axiom as a premise on which 
to rest its false doctrine. The rationalistic principle is: “We must 
assume that the result is the interpretation of the purpose of God.” 
(Hodge, Syst. Theol., II, 323.) Reformed theology reasons thus: 
“Since actually not all are saved, we must assume that God did 
not intend to save all.” In this way Calvinistic theology rejects 
Holy Scripture in favor of an argument drawn from reason, or 
a rationalistic axiom; and on this departure from the Word of 
God and its consequent enthronement of reason the Reformed fac¬ 
tion is founded. Just as soon as its theology ceases to be ration¬ 
alistic, it will also cease to be separatists. 

Within the pale of the Reformed denomination itself the strict 
Calvinistic doctrine of the particularity of divine grace has been 
emphatically denied by the Arminian party. Arminian theology 
denied the Calvinistic error that God from eternity has predeter¬ 
mined a certain number of men to damnation. However, on the 
other hand, Arminian theology erred by denying that grace alone 
(sola gratia) saves sinners. Over against the doctrine of sola 
gratia, so clearly taught by Luther, it reasoned that man’s conver¬ 
sion and salvation depends, at least to some extent, on his coopera¬ 
tion and the exercise of his free will. Calvinism denies the gratia 
universalis, while Arminianism denies the sola gratia. Thus also 
Arminianism is a departure from Holy Scripture, which ascribes 
man’s conversion exclusively to divine monergism, Eph. 1, 19; 
Phil. 1, 29; 1 Cor. 1, 23; 2,14. Arminianism simply revamped 
the error of Erasmus, who, Luther said, “seized him by the 
throat” when he taught that man by nature has the ability to apply 
himself to divine grace (facultas se applicandi ad gratiam) and 
thus to cooperate in his conversion. 

What has just been said of Arminianism applies also with 
regard to synergism (an error taught within the Lutheran Church). 
Synergism also denies the sola gratia and affirms, in opposition to 
Holy Scripture, that man’s conversion depends in part on his right 
conduct, self-decision, lesser guilt, etc. Synergism was introduced 
into Lutheran theology by Melanchthon, who maintained that there 
are three causes of salvation: the Holy Ghost, the Word of God, 
and man’s assenting will. This doctrine is distinctly antichristian 
and, if actually believed, will prevent the sinner’s conversion, since 
saving faith is engendered only in a contrite heart, which trusts 
for salvation alone in divine grace. If synergists are actually saved. 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


23 


it is only because they give up their false doctrine and cling solely 
to God’s grace in Christ Jesus while smarting under the terrors of 
conscience (terrores conscientiae). It is said of Melanchthon that 
he personally did not believe his false doctrine; for invariably 
when imploring God as a penitent sinner, he appealed exclusively 
to divine grace for salvation. Nevertheless this influential teacher, 
by promulgating his synergistic errors, caused divisions within the 
Lutheran Church that did incalculable harm and are still troubling 
the Church in many ways. Thus also within Lutheran Christen¬ 
dom divisions and offenses have been caused by manifest departures 
from Holy Scripture. 

Finally we may speak of the divisions within Christendom 
that owe their origin to modern "scientific theology.” Modern 
rationalistic theology, which dates back to Schleiermacher and 
Eitschl, denies the Christian doctrine that Holy Scripture is God’s 
own, infallible Word and hence discards it as the only source and 
norm of doctrine. It thus rejects the only principle by which the 
Christian Church may preserve its inherent and essential unity; 
for the unity of the Church does not consist in external forms, but 
in doctrinal agreement, which must necessarily cease if Holy 
Scripture is rejected as the only norm of faith. 

Modern theology suggests as norms of faith the "Christian 
experience,” “Christian consciousness,” “the regenerate heart,” etc.; 
but all these "norms” in the final analysis coincide with carnal 
reason, which by its very nature is in opposition to divine truth. 
This is conclusively proved by the results, found everywhere where 
the “norms” just named have been adopted. Thus modern ration¬ 
alistic theology unanimously denies the cardinal doctrine of justi¬ 
fication by grace, through faith, teaching in its place the paganistic 
doctrine of salvation by work-righteousness. Again, it denies the 
fundamental Christian doctrine of the divine inspiration of Holy 
Scripture and consequently also its inerrancy. Thus it rejects the 
two distinctive articles of the Christian faith and causes divisions 
and offenses contrary to the teachings of Christ and His apostles. 
The Christian Church demands of modern theology that it must 
surrender its opposition to Holy Scripture as the only source and 
norm of faith and to the vicarious atonement of Christ as the only 
means of a sinner’s justification. And that is Christ’s own demand, 
John 8, 31. 32; 1 Pet. 4,11. 

The point, then, is clear: Divisions within Christendom owe 
their origin and existence to actual departure from Holy Scripture 



24 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


and its divine doctrines. Wherever they exist, they may be traced 
to the perversion and rejection of divine truth and must be con¬ 
demned as the vicious work of Satan and his false prophets. 

The confessional Lutheran Church itself has been styled a 
“sect” within Christendom by non-Lutheran writers. But no charge 
is more unjust than that. The charge is due to a complete mis¬ 
understanding of the Reformation. The Lutheran Reformation 
was not an effort to found a new sect, or division, within Christen¬ 
dom, but to restore the corrupted Church to its ancient apostolic 
purity in doctrine and practise. The confessional Lutheran Church 
is therefore the ancient Church of Christ and His apostles, purified 
from the corruptions of papistical errors and restored on the basis 
of Holy Scripture. Its character is truly ecumenical; for its doc¬ 
trines are not peculiar views and tenets, distinct from those of the 
Apostolic Church, but the very doctrines around which the ancient 
ecumenical creeds of Christendom center. Its theology is that of 
the Holy Bible, and of the Bible alone; its doctrine is the divine 
truth of God’s Word. The Lutheran Church is therefore the 
orthodox visible Church of Christ on earth. This is both its claim 
and its glory, and it challenges every charge of sectarianism made 
against it. 

We freely admit of course that also within the Lutheran 
Church divisions have been caused by departures, both in doctrine 
and in practise, from Holy Scripture and from the Lutheran Con¬ 
fessions. Hence, when we use the term Lutheran Church, we do 
not include those divisions, or parties, but refer exclusively to that 
Lutheran Church or those Lutheran churches which are thoroughly 
Scriptural and thoroughly Lutheran both in doctrine and in 
practise. In other words, the Lutheran Church is that Church 
which stands four-square on the principles of the Reformation. 

With regard to Christian unity it must be emphatically stated 
that this is not the work of man, but of divine grace, John 17, 
11—15.20.21; Ps. 86,11; etc. Human influence, wisdom, and 
ingenuity do not suffice to preserve the unity of faith or doctrine. 
That precious boon is the gift of the Holy Spirit, who graciously 
bestows and maintains it through the Word of God. For this 
reason all Christians must diligently pTay for the unity of the 
Spirit and zealously use the means of grace, by which alone it is 
preserved. For wherever the Word of God is despised or rejected, 
no true unity of faith can prevail. Christians remain united in 
the faith only as long as they stand united upon God’s pure Word.

6. CHRISTIANITY THE ABSOLUTE RELIGION. 

The Christian religion is the absolute religion, inasmuch as 
it is absolutely perfect, neither requiring, nor being capable of, 
improvement or development. It is God-given (tfcdodozoc) and 
therefore precisely as God would have it to accomplish its 
beneficent purpose of saving sinners. When we ascribe to the 
Christian religion perfection or absoluteness, we do not mean to 
say that it is a “logically complete whole” (ein logisch vollkom- 
menes Oanzes) or a logically complete and perfect system, in which 
there are no missing links of thought. The Christian’s knowledge, 
the apostle says, and he includes his own, is but fragmentary. 
1 Cor. 13,12: “Now I know in part.” What Christianity knows 
of divine wisdom through revelation is only a part of the un¬ 
searchable knowledge of God. 

Again, the Christian religion is not perfect, or absolute, in 
the sense of constituting the best system of morality (die voll- 
kommenste Moral), although that, of course, is true. The moral 
theology of Holy Scripture is indeed perfect, for it centers in, and 
aims at, perfect love of God and the neighbor, Matt. 22, 37—40. 
Both its demand and its goal are perfect love, Matt. 5,48: “Be ye 
therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” 
But this perfect morality does not constitute the essence of the 
Christian religion; it is rather the effect, or fruit, of the Chris¬ 
tian faith, which the Holy Spirit implants in the human heart 
through the means of grace, or, as we may say briefly, it is the 
result of Christianity, not Christianity itself, 1 John 4, 9—21; 
Rom. 12,1. 

Nevertheless the Christian religion is absolute, that is, alto¬ 
gether perfect and unsurpassable. There are two reasons for this. 
In the first place, the Christian religion is not a moral code, teach¬ 
ing men how they may reconcile God by good works, but it is 
divine faith in the amazing fact that God through Christ “recon¬ 
ciled the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto 
them,” 2 Cor. 5,19. In that sense the Christian religion is abso¬ 
lute, that is, perfect and unsurpassable; for through the Gospel of 
Christ it offers to sinful mankind a perfect and incomparable 
reconciliation, effected through the vicarious atonement of the Son 
of God, the divine Redeemer of the world, who for us and in our 
stead satisfied the demands of divine justice (active obedience) and 
paid the penalty of sin (passive obedience). Gal. 4, 4. 5; 3, 13; 
Is. 53; 2 Cor. 5, 21. Every sinner who believes this reconciliation, 



26 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


or forgiveness of sin, is justified, or declared righteous, by grace, 
without the deeds of the Law, Acts 26,18; Luke 24, 46. 47; Eom. 
10, 17; 1 Cor. 2, 4. 5; Rom. 3, 28; 6, 1. That is the glorious 
gift which Christianity freely offers to all sinners. It announces to 
lost mankind that God by grace imputes to sinful man, who in 
himself is ungodly and condemned, the perfect righteousness of 
Christ through faith or that He covers the unrighteousness of the 
penitent believer with the perfect righteousness of His divine Son, 
Jesus Christ. Rom. 4, 5: “To him that worketh not, but believeth 
on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for right¬ 
eousness.” 1 John 2, 2: “He [Christ] is the Propitiation for our 
sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole 
world.” That is the wonderful absoluteness, or perfection, of the 
Christian religion: it proffers perfect reconciliation and salvation 
by grace and puts the believer into perfect and complete possession 
of God’s choicest gifts — His divine grace, His complete pardon, 
His peace, which passes all understanding, in short, spiritual and 
eternal life. Thus Christianity fully accomplishes what religion 
should accomplish — it reunites sinful mankind with the holy God 
and restores to him all that he has lost through sin. Col. 2, 
10—14: “And ye are complete” (perfect, r iXeioi), “in Him,” etc. 

It goes without saying that the Christian religion is abso¬ 
lute, or perfect, only if it is preserved in its purity, that is to say, 
if its character as a religion of grace and faith is fully maintained, 
or if its central doctrine of justification by grace, through faith 
in the vicarious atonement of Christ, is retained unadulterated. 
If this chief doctrine of the Christian religion is perverted or re¬ 
moved, then Christianity becomes dechristianized, a neopagan 
religion, unworthy of the name it bears, and incapable of saving 
sinners. Thus Romanism, which teaches justification through 
“infused grace” (gratia infusa) and consequently by “good 
works” (Council of Trent, Sess. VI, Cans. 11.12. 20), paganizes 
Christianity in its central teaching, and the result is that the 
sinner fails to obtain divine pardon and, besides, is burdened with 
the curse of uncertainty (monstrum incertitudinis) as to his state 
of grace. Gal. 5, 4: “Christ is become of no effect unto you who¬ 
soever of you are justified by the Law; ye are fallen from grace.” 

Similarly the doctrine of justification by grace, through faith 
in Christ, is corrupted by the rationalistic Protestant theologians 
of to-day, who reject the Scriptural doctrine of Christ’s vicarious 
atonement and in its place inculcate their own erroneous “theories 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


27 


of atonement.” They, too, deny the central Gospel truth that 
men are justified by faith alone, and through their man-made 
theories of atonement they paganize the Christian religion. ( The 
Moral Example Theory: Christ’s death should induce men to 
repent, reform and mend their conduct. The Governmental 
Theory: Christ died simply to show erring man that sin is dis¬ 
pleasing in God’s sight, since God’s government of the world neces¬ 
sitates such manifestation of wrath against sin. The Declaratory 
Theory: Christ died to show how much God loves man, etc.) The 
central article of Christianity is likewise denied and perverted by 
all Pelagians, Arminians, and synergists, who maintain that man’s 
salvation depends, at least in part, on his good conduct and works. 
The Christian religion, if so perverted, is deprived of its very 
■essence and is therefore no longer absolute, or perfect, since in its 
paganized form it is unable to save sinners. 

In the second place, the Christian religion is absolute, that is, 
perfect and unsurpassable, because its source and norm is not the 
fallible word of erring men, but the infallible Word of the in- 
arrant God, as this is set forth in Holy Scripture, John 10, 35; 
2 Tim. 3, 15—17; 1 Pet. 1, 10—12; Eph. 2, 20. Since Holy 
Scripture is divinely inspired, it is the absolute divine truth, 
John 17,17; and the Christian religion, which is drawn from this 
absolute truth, is the only true religion, whereas all other religions, 
falsely so called, are in fact not religions at all. This fact must 
be given great emphasis to-day; for at present unionistic and 
syncretistic tendencies are very strong even in Christian circles, 
and norms outside of, and contrary to, Holy Scripture are so 
readily adopted. Holy Scripture is the only norm of faith, and 
only that is true religion which is true Scripture-teaching. 

This truth we stoutly affirm not only against Modernism, 
which rejects Holy Scripture altogether, but also against modern 
rationalizing theology, which establishes as norms, besides Holy 
Scripture, such things as “Christian consciousness,” “Christiau 
conviction,” “Christian experience,” etc., and no less against 
Eomanism, which declares tradition to be a source and rule of 
faith. In short, all who desire to maintain the Christian religion 
as the absolute religion must adhere to both the doctrine of justifi¬ 
cation by grace, through faith in the vicarious atonement of Christ, 
and to the doctrine that Holy Scripture, as the inspired, inerrant 
Word of God, is the only source and standard of faith. The 
Christian religion is absolute only if it is presented and taught 
as God Himself has given it to us in His Word. 



28 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


The Christian religion was given to sinful mankind imme¬ 
diately after the Pall and was then, as it is now, the only absolute 
religion because it alone offered to, and bestowed upon, men sal¬ 
vation from sin through faith in the divinely appointed Redeemer 
of the world, Gen. 3,15; Acts 10,43. Throughout the Old Testa¬ 
ment the Gospel of Christ was proclaimed no less than in the 
New Testament, John 5,39; 8,56; Acts 10,43, although in the 
New Testament the preaching of the Gospel is clearer and more 
complete than in the Old Testament. When Holy Scripture speaks 
of the abrogation of the Old and the institution of the New Testa¬ 
ment, this does not refer to the preaching of the Gospel, which 
is the essence of Christianity, but to the Mosaic covenant of the 
Law, which has been abolished by the coming of Christ, Jer. 31, 
31—34; Heb. 8, 6—13; Gal. 3,17 £F.; Col. 2,16. Thus, while in 
the Old Testament divine revelation was progressive in the sense 
that the message of Christ’s coming and redemption was announced 
ever more clearly and fully, the religion which God gave to 
Adam and Eve after the Fall was from the very beginning abso¬ 
lute, that is, perfect and complete, because it was adequate to ac¬ 
complish the salvation of sinners. The claim that the Old Testa¬ 
ment presents to us essentially different religions, such as the 
patriarchal, the Mosaic, the prophetic, etc., is unfounded and con¬ 
tradicts the incontestable statements of Holy Scripture, Acts 
15,10.11; Rom. 4, 3—6; Heb. 11. Christ was always the only 
Savior of all sinners, and no one has ever been saved except 
through faith in Him. Acts 4,12: “Neither is there salvation in 
any other; for there is none other name under heaven given 
among men whereby we must be saved.” 

In view of the fact that the Christian religion is the only true 
religion, it is incorrect to speak of it as “the highest religion” or 
“the most perfect religion” or “the climax of all religions,” etc. 
Such superlatives express only a difference in degree, whereas the 
difference between Christianity and all other religions so called is 
one of kind. Christianity is a God-made religion; all others are 
man-made. For this reason it is objectionable also to say that 
Christianity offers to man “the highest satisfaction.” As a matter 
of fact, Christianity alone offers satisfaction to sinful men, since it 
alone conveys and seals to them the grace of God, forgiveness of 
sins, and life eternal. The character of absoluteness belongs only 
to the religion of Jesus Christ. 

When the question is considered as to what constitutes the

29 


essential difference between the Old and the New Testament, we 
must seek the difference not in the religion itself, hut in the acci¬ 
dental feature of greater clearness and fulness. Essentially the 
two are the same. The doctrinal content does not differ; for in 
both we find the same Moral Law, and the same Oospel-message, 
that sinners are saved alone by God’s grace in His Son, our Savior. 
This is attested by Christ Himself, who not only declared the Old 
Testament to be the divine truth, John 5, 45—47; 10, 35; 5, 39, 
but also affirmed that He is the Christ of the Old Testament, Luke 
24, 25—27. Our divine Lord became incarnate not to teach a new 
religion, but to fulfil the Old Testament prophecies concerning 
Himself and by His holy suffering and death to secure the salva¬ 
tion promised by the prophets. Matt. 5,17—19; Rom. 3,28—31; 
Col. 2,10—14. As Christ, so also the apostles, especially St. Paul, 
declared the Old Testament Scriptures to be able to make believers 
wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus, 2 Tim. 
3,15—17. Likewise St. Paul expressly teaches that the doctrine of 
justification by grace, through faith, is not a new doctrine, but the 
doctrine proclaimed by the prophets in the Old Testament and 
believed by all Old Testament believers, Rom. 3,21. 22; chap. 4. 
From all this it is obvious that the religion of the Old Testament 
is essentially the Christian religion, which by its very nature is 
perfect and unsurpassable, or the absolute religion of God. 

7. THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY. 

There are theologians who suggest the following distinction 
between Christian religion and Christian theology. They say that 
the Christian religion in its subjective sense is the knowledge of 
God which is possessed by every Christian believer, while Christian 
theology in its subjective sense is the knowledge of God which is 
possessed by the official teachers of the Church. Rightly under¬ 
stood, this distinction may be accepted; for Holy Scripture, while 
teaching that all believers possess knowledge of God, emphasizes 
the fact that the official teachers of the Church must possess knowl¬ 
edge of God in a higher degree, John 6,45; 1 Cor. 12,29; 1 Tim. 
3, 2; 2 Tim. 2,1. In these passages it is taught that, while be¬ 
lievers are “all taught of God,” yet they are not “all teachers” and 
that bishops, or ministers, must be “apt to teach” and must there¬ 
fore have the doctrines of God’s Word committed unto them in 
such a way that they “shall be able to teach others.” — Neverthe¬ 
less it must be maintained that there is no essential difference 



30 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


between religion and theology. Both have the same principle 
(principium cognoscendi), or source, namely, Holy Scripture, and 
both are received in one and the same manner, namely, through 
faith in the Word of God. John 8, 31. 32: “If ye continue in My 
Word, then are ye My disciples indeed; and ye shall know the 
truth.” 

We hold, then, that both the religious and the theological 
knowledge are fundamentally the same and are obtained by the 
same method, namely, through the believing study of, and prayerful 
meditation upon, God’s Word. Whatever is not taken from, or 
whatever goes beyond, Holy Scripture is neither religion nor 
theology, but human speculation. Quod non est biblicum, non 
est theologicum. This truth must be held over against all ration¬ 
alistic theologians, who assert that Christian theology is something 
that lies beyond the Christian religion as basically different from it, 
and in particular, that the Christian theologian intellectually com¬ 
prehends the mysteries of faith, whereas the ordinary Christian 
believer merely accepts them by faith. That such views are 
disastrous both to religion and theology requires no further proof. 
As a matter of fact, Christian theology is not a speculative system 
of philosophy, the substance of which lies within human intellec¬ 
tual comprehension; but it is “the wisdom of God in a mystery,” 
1 Cor. 2, 7. (The meaning of Paul’s statement is evidently: “In 
speaking the wisdom of God, we proclaim a mystery.”) For this 
reason a childlike faith in God’s Word is essential no less to the 
Christian theologian than to the ordinary Christian believer. 
A theologian is a Christian theologian only inasmuch as he im¬ 
plicitly believes in Christ and unconditionally accepts His Word. 

8. CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY. 

Etymologically considered, the term theology may be defined 
as “the Word concerning God” (Xoyog tieqI &eov). In the subjec¬ 
tive sense the term denotes the knowledge of God (Oottesgelahrt- 
heit) as it inheres in the theologian; in its objective sense it desig¬ 
nates the doctrine concerning God as it is presented in a book or 
treatise. (Cp. the meaning of psychology, physiology, biology, 
geology, etc.) Thomas Aquinas summarizes the meaning and 
function of theology as follows: “Theologia a Deo docetur, Deurn 
docet et ad Deum ducit The name God in connection with loyo?,. 
however, always denotes the object, so that theology in its objec¬ 
tive sense is properly the doctrine which teaches God (Deum docet). 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


31 


The term theology in its common significance (usus loquendi) 
does not occur in Holy Scripture. It is therefore a " vox non 
eyygatpog, sed dygaqpog, quamvis non dvrlygaypoi,” that is to say, 
a term used not in, but outside Scripture, yet one that is not against 
Scripture. The heading of St. John’s Revelation, ’AjzoxaXvync 
'Icodvvov xov deokoyov, as Gerhard correctly points out, was not 
selected by the author of that book, but was added by later copyists. 
This fact proves that the term theology was widely used already 
by the earliest Christian writers and was quite generally understood 
also in its specific meaning. However, the term theology was used 
also by non-Christian authors, and this fact must not surprise us, 
since man by nature has a certain knowledge of God, the divine 
Law being inscribed in his heart, Bom. 1 and 2. Pagan writers 
applied the term theology to the doctrine of God as this was taught 
by their poets and philosophers, whom some styled thdblogians. 
Thus Aristotle says of Thales and of the philosophers before Thales, 
who speculated on the origin of things, that they theologized 
{deoXoyr)oavxEQ). Cicero declares expressly: “Principio loves tree 
numerant, qui theologi nominantur (Cp. Aristotle, Metaph., 
I, 3; Cicero, De Natura Deorum, III, 21.) 

Nevertheless the term theology has not always been used in 
the same sense. This varying use of the term need not give us 
any concern since the word itself does not occur in Holy Scripture 
and may therefore be employed in sacred theology in different sig¬ 
nifications, as long as it is not made to represent something that 
in itself is condemned by God’s Word. The concepts which it is 
made to express should themselves be Scriptural. The term is 
used correctly and in accordance with Holy Scripture if it de¬ 
notes — 

1. The particular knowledge of God which those possess 
who are called to administer the public ministry, in other words, 
the special knowledge of pastors and teachers of the Church, 
1 Tim. 3, 2; 

2. The particular knowledge of God which is demanded of 
those who are called to prepare Christian ministers and teachers 
for their high calling, or the special knowledge of theological pro¬ 
fessors, 2 Tim. 2, 2; 

3. The general knowledge of God which all true believers pos¬ 
sess, especially the experienced Christians, whose knowledge of 
spiritual matters has been deepened by much prayerful meditation 
and practical experience in their profession of Christ, so that they 



32 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


themselves, in their limited sphere, are competent to teach others, 
1 Pet. 3,15; Col. 3,16; 

4. The special knowledge of certain parts of the Christian 
doctrine, in particular, the doctrine of the deity of Christ and of 
the Trinity. Thus Gregory Nazianzen (died ca. 390) was called 
d deokoyos because he defended the deity of Christ with special 
distinction. And Basilius applied the term theology to the doc¬ 
trine of the Holy Trinity. (Cp. Pieper, Christliche Dogmatik, 
Vol. I, p. 47.) 

As the term is applied generally, it denotes in its abstract 
sense, or objectively, either the entire Christian doctrine (usus 
generalis) or the particular doctrine concerning God (usus 
specialis). 

If the term theology is employed in the above significations, 
it is used in conformity with Holy Scripture and therefore cor¬ 
rectly. But if it is applied to any doctrine that goes beyond Scrip¬ 
ture or to a system of doctrine that is not exclusively based on 
Scripture, but rather on “Christian consciousness,” “Christian 
experience,” “Christian tradition,” etc., it is misapplied. For 
whatever is not drawn from Scripture is not theology at all, but 
human speculation, and that after all is nothing else than error 
and delusion, 1 Tim. 6, 3. 4: “knowing nothing.” 

In this treatise we use the term theology both subjectively, 
or concretely, to denote the spiritual ability (ixavoitje, habitus) to 
teach and defend the Word of God, in short, to administer the 
functions of the Christian ministry in the true Scriptural manner 
(2 Cor. 3, 5. 6), and objectively, or abstractly, for the Christian 
doctrine, either in whole or in part, presented either orally or in 
writing, 2 Tim. 1,13. Both uses are Scriptural. Subjective, or 
concrete, theology is the spiritual habitude of the Christian 
teacher; objective, or abstract, theology is the product, or result, 
of this ability. Also, we hold that the first meaning of the term 
is the primary, since theology must first be found in the soul of 
a person before that person can teach and present it either by word 
or in writing. If we call the product of the inherent ability 
theology, this is done by way of metonymy, the effect being named 
after the cause. For the Christian theologian this distinction is 
of paramount importance because it constantly reminds him that 
studying theology means not simply the intellectual apprehension 
of a number of facts, but the true regeneration, conversion, and 
sanctification of his own heart, from which his whole ministerial 
service must flow. 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY.

Dr. A. L. Graebner, in his Outlines of Doctrinal Theology 
(p. 1), defines theology in its subjective, or concrete, sense as 
follows: “Theology is a practical habitude of the mind, comprising 
the knowledge and acceptance of divine truth, together with an 
aptitude to instruct others toward such knowledge and acceptance 
and to defend such truth against its adversaries.” Theology in its 
objective, or abstract, sense he defines (p. 2) as “an oral or written 
exhibition of the truths, doctrines, principles, etc., by virtue of 
the knowledge, acceptance, maintenance, and practical application 
of which a theologian is a theologian.” 

9. THEOLOGY FURTHER CONSIDERED AS A HABITUDE. 

Theology as a habitude, or ability, is described in all those 
Scripture-passages which depict the character and qualifications 
of the true Christian minister, who, in the sense of Holy Scripture, 
is a true theologian, possessing the ability (ly.aroTtjg, sufficiency) 
to administer the functions of the ministry in the divinely ap¬ 
pointed manner. On the basis of Holy Scripture we may therefore 
describe the theological habitude as follows: — 

a. The theological habitude is a spiritual habitude (habitus 
spirituals, supernaturalis), that is to say, an ability which is im¬ 
planted in the soul not by natural gifts, but by the Holy Ghost. 
It presupposes personal faith in Christ’s vicarious atonement and 
consequently the regeneration, or conversion, of the theologian. 
Unbelieving ministers or teachers do not deserve the name of 
theologian; and in the sense of Holy Scripture they are not theo¬ 
logians, though they may have apprehended the doctrines of the 
Word of God intellectually and be able to present them clearly 
and correctly. In other words, there is no theologia irregenitorum, 
or theology of the unregenerate, since the souls of the unconverted 
and unbelieving are not inhabited and actuated by the Holy Ghost, 
but by the “prince of this world,” that is, Satan. Eph. 2, 2: 
“Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this 
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit 
that now worketh in the children of disobedience.” Holy Scripture 
always describes a true minister of Christ as a penitent, believing 
child of God, who ascribes to divine grace both his sufficiency and 
his call into the ministry. 2 Cor. 3, 5: “Not that we are sufficient 
of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency 
is of God, who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testa¬ 
ment.” 2 Tim. 2,1 ff.: “Be strong in the grace that is in Christ 

3 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 


84 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


Jesus,” etc. A true minister of Christ, or theologian, is therefore 
a sanctified believer. 1 Tim. 3,2 ff.: “A bishop must be blame¬ 
less, ... of good behavior, . . . apt to teach,” etc. 

Unbelieving and unregenerate ministers hold their sacred 
office not by God's will, but only by His permission. Although 
their personal unbelief does not render inefficacious the Word they 
preach and the Sacraments they administer, provided they preach 
the Word of God in truth and purity and administer the Sacra¬ 
ments according to Christ’s institution, yet the incumbency and 
administration of the sacred office by hypocrites greatly dishonors 
the Lord and is an offense to the Church and a perpetual menace 
to the faith and piety of their hearers. Jer. 14, 14—16: “The 
prophets prophesy lies in My name. I sent them not, neither have 
I commanded them. ... By sword and famine shall those prophets 
be consumed. And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast 
out in the streets.” Cp. also Jer. 23,11—32; Ezek. 13, 3—9; etc. 

It was this important truth, namely, that a true theologian 
is a sincere believer, that prompted our dogmaticians to describe 
theology, first of all, as a habitus spiritualis vel supernaturalis 
(deoadovos), conferred by the Holy Spirit through the Word of 
God. Baier thus writes (I, 69): “Theology is by its very nature 
a supernatural habitude, acquired not by any powers of our own, 
but by the powers of grace through the operation of the Holy 
Ghost.” He adds that all theology which is not wrought by the 
Holy Ghost is so called only in an improper sense. (Ita nonnisi 
aequivoce dicta theologia est.) So also Luther writes: “A doc¬ 
tor of Holy Scripture no one can make for you except the 
Holy Spirit from heaven, as Christ says, John 6, 45: ‘And they 
shall be all taught of God.’” (St. L., X, 399.) The spiritual 
habitude of theology implies also faith in Holy Scripture as the 
divinely inspired, infallible Word of God; and this faith, too, is 
the work and gift of the Holy Ghost. 

b. The theological habitude further includes the ability to 
refrain from all human opinions and thoughts on God and divine 
things, to draw all doctrines from Holy Scripture, and thus to 
teach nothing but God’s Word. John 8, 31. 32: “If ye continue in 
My Word, then are ye My disciples indeed.” St. Paul writes to 
Timothy, 1 Tim. 6, 3. 4: “If any man teach otherwise and consent 
not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, 
knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words.” 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


35 


That the “words of our Lord Jesus Christ” are not merely the 
words which our Savior Himself spoke during His sojourn on 
earth, but all the inspired writings of the prophets and the apostles, 
is proved by various passages, John 17, 20; 1 Pet. 1,10—12; Eph. 
2, 20; etc. These passages disqualify and bar all teachers of the 
Church who, while rejecting Holy Scripture as the sole source and 
norm of faith, draw their doctrines from false sources, such as 
“Christian traditions,” the “regenerate heart,” “Christian con¬ 
sciousness,” “private revelations,” “Christian experience,” etc. 
Luther, in his exposition of Jer. 23,16, correctly remarks: “Behold, 
all prophets who do not preach out of the mouth of God deceive, 
and God forbid that we should hear them.” (St. L., XIX, 821.) 

c. The theological habitude includes, moreover, the ability to 
teach the whole Word of God as it is set forth in Holy Scripture. 
In order to attest his ministerial faithfulness, St. Paul said to the 
elders of Ephesus, Acts 20, 27: “I have not shunned to declare 
unto you all the counsel of God.” Christian ministers must pro¬ 
claim the whole Word of God in its truth and purity to be “pure 
from the blood of all men,” as St. Paul witnesses concerning him¬ 
self, Acts 20,26: “Wherefore I take you to record this day that 
I am pure from the blood of all men.” It is for this very 
reason that the apostle so earnestly admonishes Timothy, 1 Tim. 
4,16: “Take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine; continue in 
them; for in doing this, thou shalt both save thyself and them 
that hear thee.” A Christian teacher should therefore “take heed 
unto the doctrine,” study it with great zeal and diligence, preach it 
fully and without admixture of human opinion, and thus prove 
himself faithful by presenting to his hearers all the doctrines of 
God’s Word. Matt. 28, 20: “Teaching them to observe all things 
whatsoever I have commanded you.” 1 Cor. 4, 2: “Moreover, it is 
required in stewards that a man be found faithful.” Jer. 48,10: 
“Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully” (mar¬ 
ginal note: “negligently”). Such ability, however, is not of man’s 
own power, but of God. 

d. The theological habitude implies also the ability to convince 
the gainsayers. Titus 1, 9: “Holding fast the faithful Word as he 
hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to 
exhort and to convince the gainsayers.” Holy Scripture never pro¬ 
hibits polemics, but rather commands it, since controversy, if car¬ 
ried on in the commendable spirit of Christian charity, is never 
destructive, but highly profitable to the Church. Every kind 



36 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGV. 


of polemics that is prompted by, and exhibits, a carnal, factious 
spirit is, of course, an abuse of Christian controversy and is there¬ 
fore forbidden. Titus 3, 9: “But avoid foolish questions and gen¬ 
ealogies and contentions and strivings about the Law; for they are 
unprofitable and vain.” 2 Cor. 10, 3: ‘Tor though we walk in the 
flesh, we do not war after the flesh.” Again, true polemics requires 
not only the refutation of false doctrine, but also the clear and 
Scriptural presentation of the true doctrine in order that the oppo¬ 
nent may be won over to the divine truth; for this, after all, is 
the final purpose of all true polemics, that falsehood may be elimi¬ 
nated and divine truth be received. Toleration of false doctrine 
within the Church is unfaithfulness to God’s Word and therefore 
unfaithfulness to God Himself, who has entrusted His truth to the 
care of His Church, Matt. 28,19. 20. 

For this reason also the ministry of Christ and His apostles 
was largely spent in polemics; for while they were teaching the 
truth, they always testified against error. Matt. 7,15: “Beware of 
false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing; but in¬ 
wardly they are ravening wolves.” Eom. 16,17: “I beseech you, 
brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary 
to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.” False 
doctrine is so pernicious and so displeasing to God that He de¬ 
mands not only the refutation of all error, but also the excom¬ 
munication of the errorist in case he proves himself a heretic. 
Eom. 16,17 : “And avoid them.” 2 John 10: “If there come any 
unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your 
house, neither bid him Godspeed.” Clearly and emphatically Holy 
Scripture rejects every form of syncretism, or unionism. 

No matter what the motives may be that induce men to depart 
from Holy Scripture and to cause divisions and offenses contrary to 
the truth of God’s Word, they must all be condemned as carnal 
and sinful. There are no “noble” motives for causing divisions 
within the Church; they are all equally reprehensible and ungodly. 
Holy Scripture describes them as follows: belly service, Eom. 
16,18; pride, 1 Tim. 6,4; the inordinate desire for honor, John 
5, 44; unwillingness to suffer for Christ’s sake. Gal. 6,12; envy, 
Matt. 27,18; perversity, 1 Tim. 6, 4; John 16, 3; 1 Tim. 1,13; 
the personal vanity and viciousness of theologians, 2 Tim. 3, 
1—9; etc. “Many heresies have arisen in the Church only from 
the hatred of the teachers ( Apology, III, 121.) Divisions within 
the Church are therefore not pleasing to God, nor do they exist by 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


37 


the will of God, but they are God’s just punishment upon those who 
do not love the truth. 2 Thess. 2,10—12 : “Because they received 
not the love of the truth that they might be saved, for this cause 
God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie, 
that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had 
pleasure in unrighteousness.” 

e. The theological habitude lastly embraces the ability to 
suffer for the sake of Christ and His Word. 2 Tim. 2, 3: “Thou 
therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ”; v. 9: 
“Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil-doer, even unto bonds. But 
the Word of God is not bound.” The suffering of Christians in 
general and of Christian ministers in particular is caused by the 
world’s hatred of, and contempt for, God’s Word. 1 Cor. 1, 23: 
“We preach Christ Crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block and 
unto the Greeks foolishness.” The result of the world’s antagonism 
to the Gospel of Christ is described by our Savior as follows: “Ye 
shall be hated of all nations for My name’s sake,” Matt. 24, 9. 
Unwillingness to suffer for the Gospel’s sake leads to compromises 
with error, to the denial of divine truth, and in the end to apostasy 
from divine grace. 2 Tim. 2,12: “If we suffer, we shall also reign 
with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us.” Unless the 
Christian, and above all the Christian theologian, is ready for 
Christ’s sake to renounce ease and friendship, to take upon himself 
loss of honor and property, and even to lay down his life for the 
sake of divine truth, he cannot serve his Master as this is required 
of him. 

The theological habitude ( habitus practicus deoodoTos), then, 
is the ability, divinely bestowed, to teach the pure and unadul¬ 
terated Word of God, to declare the whole counsel of God unto 
salvation, to oppose and refute false doctrine, and to suffer for 
Christ’s sake all the consequences which the proclamation of the 
Word of God entails. 

10. THEOLOGY CONSIDERED AS DOCTRINE. 

As theology in its subjective sense is the habitude, or ability, 
to teach the Word of God as set forth in Holy Scripture in all its 
truth and purity, so Christian theology in its objective sense, or 
conceived as doctrine, is nothing more and nothing less than the 
true and pure presentation of the doctrine of Holy Scripture. 
1 Pet. 4,11: “If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of 
God.” Titus 2, 7—10: “In doctrine showing uncorruptness, 
gravity, sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned, . . . 



38 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, 
our Savior, in all things.” The claim of being a Christian theo¬ 
logian may be properly made only by him who teaches nothing but 
Scripture doctrine. 

This doctrine, however, is not drawn or developed from human 
reason, but is taken in all its parts solely from Holy Scripture. 
The function of the Christian theologian therefore consists merely 
in grouping in distinct paragraphs and chapters and under proper 
heads the various teachings which Holy Scripture inculcates in its 
several passages on one given subject. If he applies synthesis and 
analysis, it is merely in the formal arrangement of the various 
Scripture doctrines. So far as the doctrines themselves are con¬ 
cerned, he allows them to stand, neither adding thereto nor taking 
away from them, no matter whether they appear consistent with 
reason and experience or not. In this way the Christian theologian 
secures his “system of doctrine” or his “dogmatic theology.” 

In accord with this principle the Lutheran theologian Pfeiffer 
writes ( Thes . Herm., p. 5) : “Positive theology [dogmatic the¬ 
ology], rightly estimated, is nothing else than Holy Scripture 
itself, arranged under proper heads in clear order; wherefore no 
member whatsoever, not even the least, must be found in that body 
of doctrine which cannot be supported from Holy Scripture, rightly 
understood.” (Baier, I, 43. 76.) Luther very aptly calls all true 
theologians “catechumens and disciples of the prophets, because 
they repeat and preach only what they have heard and learned 
from the prophets and apostles.” (St. L., Ill, 1890.) This faith¬ 
ful repetition (Nachsagen) of the teachings of the prophets and 
apostles by the Christian theologian is to Luther a matter of such 
grave concern that he writes: “In the Church no other doctrine 
should be taught or heard than the pure Word of God, that is. 
Holy Scripture; otherwise both teachers and hearers shall be 
damned.” (Cp. Pieper, Christl. Dogmatik, I, p. 56.) The same 
truth is expressed in the axiom Quod non est biblicum, non est 
theologicum. 

The Christian theologian must therefore exclude from his 
system of doctrine all opinions and speculations of men, and he 
must teach nothing but God’s own immutable truth and doctrine 
(doctrina divina) as it is exhibited in Holy Scripture (doctrina 
e Scriptura Sacra hausta). This demand is made by God Him¬ 
self. Col. 2, 8: “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy 
and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


39 


the world, and not after Christ.” And this divine demand pertains 
not merely to the chief doctrines, on which man’s salvation depends 
directly, but to all teachings of Holy Scripture, Matt. 28, 20: 
“Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com¬ 
manded you.” In whatever matter Holy Scripture has definitely 
spoken the Christian theologian must suppress his own views, 
opinions, and speculations and adhere unwaveringly to the divine 
truths revealed in Holy Scripture. In no case is he permitted to 
inject into the body of divine truth his own figments and fabrica¬ 
tions, and at no time must he allow his reason the prerogative 
of doubt, criticism, or denial, but every thought must everywhere 
be brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 2 Cor. 10, 5. 
That is the demand which God Himself makes on all who would 
serve Him as theologians; in every instance they are to attest and 
proclaim His Word and not their own. 

All teachers of the Church who refuse to do this are not Chris¬ 
tian theologians, but false prophets, against whose pernicious work 
God warns His saints. Jer. 23,16 : “Hearken not unto the words 
of the prophets that prophesy unto you. . . . They speak a vision 
of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the Lord.” And in 
the New Testament this warning is reiterated with no less emphasis, 
1 Tim. 6, 4; 2 John 8—11; Rom. 16,17; etc. Luther’s insistence 
on faithfulness in teaching God’s Word is well known. He writes: 
“If any one wishes to preach, let him keep silence with respect to 
his own words.” “Here in the Church he should not speak any¬ 
thing but the Word of this generous Host; otherwise it is not 
the true Church. Therefore he must say, 'God speaks.’ ” 

Emphasizing the great truth that all doctrine taught in the 
Church must be divine doctrine, our Lutheran dogmaticians as¬ 
serted that all theology proclaimed by the Christian theologian 
must be ectypal theology, or derived theology (theologia Ixxvnog), 
that is, a reprint, or reproduction, of archetypal theology (theologia 
dgxhvnog), or original theology, as it is originally in God Him¬ 
self. Hollaz explains these terms as follows: “Archetypal the¬ 
ology is the knowledge which God has of Himself and which in 
Him is the model of that other theology which is communicated 
to intelligent creatures. Ectypal theology is the knowledge of God 
and divine things communicated to intelligent creatures by God 
after the pattern of His own theology.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 16.) 

Modern rationalistic theology has rejected this distinction as 
useless and misleading; in reality, however, it is most profitable,

since it expresses the Scriptural truth that God’s ministers must 
speak only what He Himself teaches in His Word. Moreover, 
the distinction is Scriptural; for it declares very clearly that 
all true knowledge of God inheres originally and essentially in 
Him and that it is by divine grace that the knowledge which is 
necessary for man’s salvation has been revealed by Him to His 
prophets and apostles. Matt. 11, 27: “No man knoweth the Son 
but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son 
and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.” To ectypal the¬ 
ology belongs also the natural knowledge of God, which man de¬ 
rives either from the Law written in his heart or from the works 
of God, Eom. 1,19 ff.; 2,14.15. Also this natural knowledge of 
God man owes to God’s revelation of Himself, Acts 14, 17; 
17, 26. 27. Nevertheless this natural knowledge of God, while 
true and useful in its place, is not sufficient to save sinners, since 
it does not include the Gospel of God’s grace in Christ Jesus. For 
this reason the only ectypal theology which may constitute the 
source of the Christian religion is that of Holy Scripture, or the 
written Word of God. Whatever is beyond, and contrary to, Holy 
Scripture does not correspond to archetypal theology and is con¬ 
demned by Scripture as vain talking ( /xaxatoloyia ). 1 Tim. 1, 6: 

“From which some, having swerved, have turned aside unto vain 
jangling” 

The paramount truth that all doctrine taught in the Church 
must be Scripture doctrine has been all but universally discarded 
by modern rationalistic theologians. The present-day “scientific 
theology” no longer recognizes Holy Scripture as the only source 
and norm of the Christian faith; on the contrary, it regards the 
identification of Christian theology with the doctrine of Scripture 
as an “abnormality” and a “repristination of a discarded theo¬ 
logical viewpoint.” Nitzsch-Stephan writes: “No one bases his 
dogmatics any longer in the old Protestant way on the norma 
normans, i.e., Holy Scripture.” (Cp. Pieper, Christl. Dogmaiik, 
I, 65.) In place of Holy Scripture modern rationalistic theology 
accepts as the norm and standard of faith the dictates of human 
reason, more or less disguised under the terms “Christian conscious¬ 
ness,” “Christian experience,” “Christian self-assurance,” etc., 
while it denounces true loyalty to the Word of God as “Biblicism,” 
“Intellectualism,” etc., which can produce only a “mere intellectual 
Christianity,” “a dead orthodoxy without inner warmth,” and 
the like. 

However, in demanding for itself these unscriptural norms. 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


41 


modern rationalistic theology only deceives itself, as even a cursory 
examination of the matter will show. Thus, for example, Christian 
experience can in no way serve as a source or norm of faith, since 
the true Christian experience is never prior to Holy Scripture, but 
depends upon, and follows, its acceptance; that is to say, only he 
who believes the Word of God as set forth in Holy Scripture expe¬ 
riences in his heart both the terror of guilt and the comfort of 
grace. As a person studies and accepts the divine Law, he becomes 
convinced that he is a sinner; as he studies and accepts the Gospel, 
he becomes convinced that his sin is forgiven through faith in 
Christ. In short, there is no true Christian experience of sin and 
grace without the means of grace, or the Word of God. This is the 
true reason for Christ's emphatic command that repentance and 
remission of sins should be preached in His name among all 
nations, Luke 24, 47. Cp. also Acts 26, 20. 

Thus the Christian experience becomes actual only through the 
preaching and acceptance of the Word of God; or we may say, the 
Word of God is the only means by which the Holy Ghost works the 
Christian experience of repentance and faith, Eom. 7,7; 1,16.17. 
On the other hand, where the Word of God is not preached, there 
is no true Christian experience. The proof for this truth is fur¬ 
nished by the very advocates of Christian experience as a norm 
of faith. Schleiermacher, for example, who insisted upon Christian 
experience as a norm of faith, rejected the central doctrine of 
Christianity by denying the vicarious atonement of Christ and 
consequently also the doctrine of justification by grace, through 
faith. Schleiermacher's experience moved him ultimately to rely 
upon his good works for salvation. But such an experience, as is 
evident, is not Christian, but carnal, rationalistic, and pagan, in 
short, the very opposite of Christianity. 

So also the “Christian faith” or “Christian consciousness” 
can in no way serve as a source and standard of Christian theology; 
for as the “Christian experience,” so also the “Christian faith” 
or “Christian consciousness” results from faithful acceptance of 
Holy Scripture. Now, since the “Christian faith” is the fruit of 
Holy Scripture, it can never be the source and norm of Christian 
theology, as little as the apple growing on a tree can be its own 
cause or source. But just as the apple is produced by the tree, so 
the Christian faith is produced by Holy Scripture; it is found only 
where Holy Scripture is adhered to and believed. Kom. 10, 17: 
“Faith cometh by hearing.” John 17,20: “Who believe through 



42 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


their Word.” Hence every “Christian faith” or every “Christian 
consciousness” which is not rooted in the Word of God, but pre¬ 
sumes to judge the Word of God, is not Christian, but carnal and 
antichristian, 1 Tim. 6, 3—5. 

What Luther writes on this point is certainly true and deserves 
conscientious consideration. He says: “Faith teaches, and holds 
to, the truth; for it clings to Scripture, which neither lies nor 
deceives. Whatsoever does not have its origin in Scripture most 
assuredly comes from the devil.” All who wish to make the 
“Christian faith” or “Christian consciousness” a norm of faith 
would do well to heed this severe, but correct condemnatory verdict. 
Our Savior declares: “If ye continue in My Word, then are ye My 
disciples indeed.” Such statements as these settle the question so 
far as the Christian theologian is concerned; his discipleship as 
well as his theology is grounded only on God’s Word and on noth¬ 
ing else. All theology that is not drawn from God’s Word opposes 
the Gospel and subverts the Christian faith, as the rationalistic 
theology of all subjective or “I theologians” proves, from Aquinas, 
Scotus, and Schleiermacher down to the present-day Modernists. 
Wherever the Word of God is not accepted in its truth and purity, 
there can be no genuine Christian theology. 

Nor can the “regenerate heart,” or the “regenerate I,” serve 
as a source or norm of the Christian faith, since a person is truly 
regenerate only as long as he, in simple faith, believes Holy 
Scripture. Mark 16, 16 b: “He that believeth not shall be 
damned.” The “regenerate heart” which modern rationalistic 
theologians would set up as a standard of faith is, in the final 
analysis, the carnal and unbelieving mind of an unregenerate 
person, rising in rebellion against the mysteries of the faith. This 
is proved by the fact that practically all who accept their “regen¬ 
erate heart” as a norm of faith deny both the inspiration and 
the infallibility of Holy Scripture. Such an outrage, however, no 
truly regenerate heart will perpetrate. 

From this it is clear that all theologians who reject Holy 
Scripture as the only source and standard of faith have fallen 
into the error of a most pernicious self-delusion. Their very in¬ 
sistence upon another source and norm outside Holy Scripture 
proves the spirit of unbelief which either consciously or uncon¬ 
sciously governs their minds, nationalistic theology demands 
other norms than the Word of God for the very reason that it 
is rationalistic and unchristian. The believing child of God 
says with Samuel: “Speak, Lord; for Thy servant heareth,” 



nature and concept of theology. 


48 


1 Sam. 3, 9. Only blind unbelief and wicked rebellion against 
God presume to judge His Word by establishing norms of faith 
in opposition to the revealed divine truth. 

Modern rationalistic theology prides itself on its true evaluation 
of the “historical character” of the Christian religion. But ortho¬ 
dox theology has never denied this “historical character”; in fact, 
the historicity of Christianity has always been asserted by believing 
theologians, on account of their firm faith in Holy Scripture. 
Indeed, just because of their faith in the “historical character” 
of the Christian religion they are opposed to all norms that are 
put forth in opposition to Holy Scripture. For “historical Chris¬ 
tianity” can be learned only from the Bible, not from any other 
source. Tradition cannot reveal it to us, nor can it originate with 
human reason. Only what Christ and His holy apostles tell us of 
the Christian religion in the Bible is “historical Christianity.” 
The “historical Christ” whom modern rationalistic theologians 
wish to construct outside Holy Scripture and the “historical 
Christianity” which they desire to build up apart from Holy 
Scripture are alike unhistorical and false, for they are figments of 
unbelieving minds. For the true “historical Christian religion” 
we must rely solely on the Bible, Matt. 28,19. 20; John 8, 31. 32; 
17,20; Eph. 2,20. 

In short, rationalistic theology is a product of unbelief and as 
such is intrinsically false, ungodly, and unscriptural. Our divine 
Lord invariably affirmed, “It is written”; modern rationalistic 
theologians contemptuously reject that formula and substitute for 
it their own subjective opinion, “I believe” and “I think.” Thus 
they teach their own word, not the Word of God. Modem ration¬ 
alistic theology can be cured of its ingrained falsity only by re¬ 
turning to Holy Scripture and adopting Luther’s fundamental 
principle: “All trust is in vain which is not founded upon the 
Word of God. God wished to present to us His will and counsels 
through His Word alone, not by means of our fancies and imagi¬ 
nations.” (St. L., "VT, 70; III, 1417.) 

11. DIVISIONS OF THEOLOGY CONCEIVED AS DOCTRINE. 

Theology, considered objectively, is Christian doctrine, or 
Bible doctrine, which, as we have seen before, is inspired in all its 
parts, so that in the whole Bible there is not a single teaching which 
is not divinely given and profitable for salvation. Nevertheless, 
while it is the scope and purpose of the entire Bible to save 



44 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


sinners from eternal perdition, distinctions must be made between 
the various Bible doctrines regarding their special function and 
importance. We thus speak of 1) Law and Gospel; 2) funda¬ 
mental and non-fundamental doctrines; 3) theological problems, 
or open questions. 

A. LAW AND GOSPEL. 

The distinction between Law and Gospel is one that is made 
by Holy Scripture itself. For while at times the term Law is used 
for the entire Word of God or every revealed truth in Holy Scrip¬ 
ture (Ps. 1, 2; 19, 7; 119, 97), nevertheless this term, in its 
proper and narrow sense, has a distinct meaning, which properly 
does not apply to the whole revealed Word of God. So, too, the 
term Oospel is sometimes applied to the entire doctrine of the 
Bible (Hark 1,1—15; Phil. 4,15). Yet in its strict sense each 
of these terms denotes a definite message, which must not be iden¬ 
tified with the entire Scripture content. Therefore, properly or 
strictly speaking, the Law is not Gospel, nor is the Gospel Law, but 
the two are opposites. Accurate definitions of them will readily 
prove this. The Formula of Concord defines the Law thus: “The 
Law is properly a divine doctrine which teaches what is right and 
pleasing to God and reproves everything that is sin and contrary 
to God’s will.” The same confession defines the Gospel in its 
narrow sense as follows: “The Gospel is properly such a doctrine 
as teaches what man who has not observed the Law and therefore 
is condemned by it is to believe, namely, that Christ has expiated, 
and made satisfaction for, all sins and has obtained and acquired 
for him, without any merit of his, forgiveness of sins, righteousness 
that avails before God, and eternal life.” (Epitome, V, 2. 4.) 
These definitions are Scriptural and nicely show the fundamental 
difference between the Law and the Gospel. How essential this 
difference is, is obvious from the fact that Holy Scripture expressly 
excludes the Law from the province of salvation. Its pronounce' 
ment is: “By grace are ye saved, . . . not of works,” Eph. 2, 8. 9. 
“Therefore by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justi¬ 
fied,” Bom. 3, 20. “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified 
by faith, without the deeds of the Law,” v. 28. 

This distinction between the Law and the Gospel, which is so 
clearly taught in Holy Scripture, the Christian theologian must 
conscientiously observe and neither weaken the condemning force 
of the Law nor diminish the saving comfort of the Gospel. He 
must declare without qualification the whole guilt and condemna-

45 


tion of sin which the Law reveals. Ezek. 3,18: “When I say unto 
the wicked. Thou shalt surely die and thou give him not warning 
nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his 
life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood 
will I require at thine hand.” So also the Christian theologian 
must proclaim fully and without any qualification the whole con¬ 
solation of the Gospel with its matchless offer of divine grace, 
pardon, and eternal life. Matt. 11, 28 : “Come unto Me, all ye that 
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” 1 Cor. 2, 2: 
“For I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus 
Christ and Him crucified.” 

Unless the Law and the Gospel are thus preached as two dis¬ 
tinct and contradictory doctrines (Luther: plus quam contradic- 
toria), the Christian religion is deprived of its distinct content, 
is paganized by the introduction of work-righteousness as a cause 
of salvation, and is therefore rendered incapable of saving sinners. 
The sinner indeed needs the Law in order that he may know his sin 
and the condemnation of God which rests upon him because of his 
sin; but he needs the Gospel in order that he may know divine 
grace, which through Christ Jesus has fully removed his sin and 
offers full forgiveness to him. Gal. 3, 10: “Cursed is every one 
that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of 
the Law to do them”; v. 13: “Christ hath redeemed us from the 
curse of the Law, being made a curse for us.” Whenever the Law 
with its condemnation is weakened and sinners are taught to rely 
for salvation on the works of the Law, though only in part, then 
the Gospel, too, is corrupted, since a weakened Law means a weak¬ 
ened Gospel. The final result is that the sinner is robbed of the 
salvation which is offered in the Gospel; for this offer is received 
only by those who implicitly trust in its divine promises and cast 
themselves upon God’s mercy, in short, by those who absolutely 
repudiate the error of salvation by works. Gal. 5,4: “Christ is 
become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the 
Law; ye are fallen from grace.” Gal. 3,10: “As many as are of 
the works of the Law are under the curse.” As the Law must for¬ 
ever remain the “ministry of condemnation,” so the Gospel must 
forever remain the “ministration of righteousness,” 2 Cor. 3, 9. 
For a person is a Christian only in so far as he comforts himself 
against the terrors of conscience with the free and full promise of 
forgiveness, “without the deeds of the Law.” 

This fundamental truth requires special emphasis to-day in 



46 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


view of the fact that both Romanism and modern Protestant sec¬ 
tarianism have discarded the Scriptural distinction between Law 
and Gospel and have mingled the two into each other. (Cp. Pieper, 
Christliche Dogmatik, I, 84 ff.) The reason for this is obvious. 
Both Romanism and modern sectarianism are basically pagan; for 
both insist upon work-righteousness as a condition of salvation. 
Now, where work-righteousness is consistently taught, the distinc¬ 
tion between Law and Gospel necessarily is eliminated, and each is 
deprived of its distinctive character. Salvation by works has room 
only in that type of theology which affirms that sin is not as 
hideous as Holy Scripture pictures it and that divine grace is not 
as glorious as the Gospel proclaims it. In other words, the pagan- 
istic error of salvation by work-righteousness is possible only if 
neither the Law nor the Gospel is taught in its truth and purity. 
Against this pernicious corruption of God’s holy Word let every 
true theologian be warned. Our divine Lord says: “Whosoever 
therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall 
teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of 
heaven,” Matt. 5,19; and St. Paul writes: “But though we or an 
angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that 
which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed,” Gal. 1, 8. — 
With regard to the use of Law and Gospel the following distinc¬ 
tions must be conscientiously observed: — 

a. Knowledge of sin must be taught from the Law; forgive¬ 
ness of sin must be taught from the Gospel. Rom. 3, 20: “There¬ 
fore by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified.” 
Rom. 1,16.17: “I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it 
is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. . . . 
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, 
as it is written, The just shall live by faith.” All who teach forgive¬ 
ness of sin from the Law or on the basis of work-righteousness are 
not Christian theologians, but false prophets, Gal. 5, 4. “I would 
they were even cut off which trouble you,” Gal. 5,12. Since by 
the Law there is the knowledge of sin, it must be preached to secure 
sinners, who, filled with carnal pride, refuse to admit their guilt. 
Rom. 3,19: “That every mouth may be stopped and all the world 
may become guilty before God.” On the other hand, the Gospel 
must be proclaimed to contrite hearts, that is, to penitent sinners, 
who have been humbled by the Law, make no assertion of having 
any merit whatsoever of their own, and gladly accept salvation as 
a free gift. Luke 4, 18: “He hath anointed Me to preach the 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


47 


Gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the broken-hearted.” 
It is needless to say that the right apportionment of Law- and 
Gospel-preaching must remain a matter of pastoral wisdom. Never¬ 
theless the true minister of Christ is above all a preacher of the 
Gospel and will therefore not deny his hearers a full and abundant 
measure of Gospel comfort. 

b. By means of the Law the Christian theologian teaches what 
good works are; but by means of the Oospel he produces true joy 
and zeal to do good works, Matt. 15,1—6; 22, 35—40; 19,16— 22 ; 
Eom. 12, 1; Gal. 5, 24—26; Eph. 6, 5—10; 2 Cor. 8, 8. 9; etc. 
These diverse functions of the Law and the Gospel have been fit¬ 
tingly expressed by the axiom: Lex praescribit; evangelium in- 
scribit. Luther writes: “A legalistic preacher compels by threats 
and punishments; a preacher of grace calls forth and moves by 
showing divine goodness and mercy.” (St. L., XII, 318.) 

c. The Law checks sin only outwardly , while it increases sin 
inwardly; but the Gospel, by converting the sinner, destroys sin 
both inwardly and outwardly. Korn. 7, 5: “For when we were in 
the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the Law, did work in 
our members to bring forth fruit unto death.” V. 6: “But now 
are we delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein we were 
held, that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the old¬ 
ness of the letter.” Eom. 6,14: “Sin shall not have dominion 
over you; for ye are not under the Law, but under grace.” This 
important truth is stated in the axiom: " Lex necat peccatorem, 
non peccatum; evangelium necat peccatum, non peccatorem.” 
Luther writes: <f Hence, whoever knows well this art of distinguish¬ 
ing between Law and Gospel, him place at the head and call him 
a doctor of Holy Scripture.” (St. L., IX, 802.) 

B. FUNDAMENTAL AND NON-FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES. 

The doctrines of Holy Scripture have been fittingly divided 
into fundamental and non-fundamental doctrines. The purpose of 
this division is not to discard certain teachings of the Word of 
God as practically unimportant or unnecessary. Such a procedure 
would be in direct opposition to Scripture itself. Matt. 28, 20: 
“Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com¬ 
manded you.” Eom. 15, 4: “For whatsoever things were written 
aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience 
and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.” According to 
these words, God demands of the Christian theologian that he 
teach the entire Scriptural content, adding nothing and taking 



48 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


away nothing. Nevertheless the distinction of which we speak is 
fully Scriptural and serves an excellent purpose. It helps the 
Christian theologian to recognize and distinguish those doctrines 
of God’s Word which “are so necessary to be known that, when 
they are not known, the foundation of faith is not savingly appre¬ 
hended or retained.” (Hollaz.) In other words, the fundamental 
doctrines are those “which cannot be denied consistently with faith 
and salvation, being the very foundation of the Christian faith.” 
(Quenstedt.) 

In order that we may understand this, we must remember that 
not everything that Holy Scripture teaches is the object or foun¬ 
dation of justifying and saving faith. For instance, we are not 
saved by believing that David was king or that the Pope in Rome is 
the great Antichrist. However, the Christian theologian does not 
for that reason deny these facts, for they are taught in God’s in¬ 
fallible Word. But these truths, which the theologian accepts as 
such, are non-fundamental as far as saving faith is concerned. 
Saving faith is faith in the forgiveness of sins through the vicarious 
atonement of Jesus Christ, or trust in the statement of Scripture 
that God justifies a sinner without the works of the Law, for 
Christ’s sake. That is the essence of the Christian religion, the 
foundation on which the entire Christian hope is built. Of this 
essence and foundation nothing can be removed without destroying 
the whole Christian religion. Any one who denies even a particle 
of this fundamental doctrine is outside the pale of the Christian 
Church. Luther says very correctly: “This doctrine [of justifica¬ 
tion by faith] is the head and corner-stone, which alone begets, 
nourishes, builds up, preserves, and protects the Church, and with¬ 
out this doctrine the Church of God cannot exist one hour.” (St. L., 
XIV, 168.) Again: “As many in the world as deny it [justifica¬ 
tion by faith] are either Jews, or Turks, or papists, or heretics.” 
(IX, 29.) Because of its paramount importance our Lutheran 
dogmaticians have called the doctrine of justification by grace 
through faith in Christ’s vicarious atonement “the most funda¬ 
mental of all doctrines” (articulus omnium fundamentalissimus). 

The doctrine of justification by grace, through faith in Christ’s 
atonement, however, presupposes and includes other fundamental 
doctrines. These are — 

a. The doctrine of sin and its consequences. All who deny 
the Scriptural doctrine of sin cannot have saving faith; for saving 
faith is implicit trust in God’s gracious forgiveness of sins. The 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


49 


true Christian believes that all his sins, both original and actual, 
are fully pardoned for Jesus 1 sake. In other words, he believes 
both the divine Law, which condemns sin, and the divine Gospel, 
which pardons sin. Both doctrines, the doctrine of sin and that 
of forgiveness of sins, are fundamental. This truth our Savior 
affirms when He says that “repentance and forgiveness of sins 
should be preached in His name among all nations,” Luke 24,47. 
According to Christ’s direction the preaching of repentance for 
sin, or of contrition, must precede the preaching of forgiveness. 
Our divine Lord further illustrates this great truth by the Parable 
of the Pharisee and the Publican. The Pharisee, who did not 
believe the Scriptural doctrine of sin and therefore did not regard 
himself as a sinner, could not be justified; in his opinion he had 
no need of justification and forgiveness. The publican, on the 
other hand, believed the fundamental doctrine of sin, declared 
himself guilty and lost, and, trusting in divine grace, received 
forgiveness through faith. In short, saving faith can exist only 
in a contrite heart, that is, in a heart which is terrified and sorry 
because of its sin. Is. 66, 2: “To this man will I look, even to 
him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at My 
Word.” Is. 57,15: “I dwell with him that is of a contrite and 
humble spirit.” Ps. 34,18: “The Lord is nigh unto them that 
are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.” 
Cp. Ps. 51, 16. 17; Luke 4, 18; Matt. 11, 28. Hence we rightly 
classify the doctrine of sin among the fundamental doctrines of 
Holy Scripture. 

b. The doctrine of the person of Christ. The doctrine of 
the person of Christ is fundamental because saving faith is trust 
in the divine-human Redeemer, who died for the sins of the world. 
For this reason the denial both of Christ’s true deity and of His 
true humanity makes saving faith impossible. Our divine Lord 
very severely discountenanced the opinions of those who regarded 
Him as John the Baptist, Elias, Jeremiah, or as one of the prophets 
and required of His disciples that they believe in Him as “the 
Christ, the Son of the living God,” Matt. 16, 13—17; cp. also 
1 John 1, 1—4. Modern rationalistic theologians, who deny the 
true deity of Christ and ascribe deity to Him only honoris causa 
(cp. Ritschl’s declaration: “In our judgment we ascribe to Him 
the value of a God”), are not Christians, but Unitarians and there¬ 
fore extra ecclesiam; that is to say, the doctrine of God which 
modern rationalistic theology inculcates is essentially paganistic,

since it rejects the true God of the Bible. It is self-evident that 
true faith in the divine Christ must include also faith in the 
Triune God. In other words, the true Christian, who believes in 
the deity of Christ, believes also that the true God is none other 
than the units Deus, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; for without 
faith in the Father no one can believe in the Son, Matt. 16,17; 
11,27; and again, without the Holy Ghost no one can call Jesus 
Lord, 1 Cor. 12, 3; Rom. 8,15; John 16,13—15. The Scriptural 
doctrine of the Holy Trinity is therefore as fundamental as is 
that of the deity of Christ. — However, also the doctrine of Christ’s 
true humanity is fundamental; for the denial of the substantial 
humanity of Christ (cp. the error of the Docetae) implies the 
denial of His actual suffering and death. Saving faith is trust in 
the vicarious atonement of the theanthropic Christ (dedvdgcDJios), 
John 1,14—17: “The Word was made flesh; . . . and of His ful¬ 
ness have all we received, and grace for grace. . . . Grace and 
truth came by Jesus Christ.” Hence we rightly classify among 
the fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion the doctrines 
of the Holy Trinity, of Christ’s true deity, and of His true 
humanity. 

c. The doctrine of Christ’s vicarious atonement. Saving faith 
is faith in Christ not merely as a Teacher of the divine Law or 
as an Ensample of Virtue or as the “Ideal Man,” as modernistic 
theology maintains, but faith in Christ as “the Mediator between 
God and men,” who has given His life as a ransom for many, and 
as “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world,” 
1 Tim. 2, 5. 6; Matt. 20, 28; Eph. 1, 7; John 1, 29. All who de¬ 
cline to put their trust in the vicarious satisfaction of Christ 
(Is. 53,1—6) are obliged to trust for reconciliation and pardon in 
their own good works and thus exclude themselves from the grace of 
God secured by Christ’s substitutionary death, Gal. 5,4. That is 
true of all who depart from the Scriptural doctrine of justification 
by grace, through faith, and reject the sola gratia and the sola fide. 
The Semi-Pelagianist, the Arminian, and the synergist, if they 
consistently hold to their error, are as much extra ecclesiam as the 
Unitarian and the Modernist. The warning of the Apology is 
well in place: “Most of those errors which our adversaries defend, 
overthrow faith, as their condemnation of the article concerning 
the remission of sins, in which we say that the remission of sins 
is received by faith. Likewise it is a manifest and pernicious error 
when the adversaries teach that men merit the remission of sins

by love to God prior to grace. In the place of Christ they set up 
their works, orders, masses, just as the Jews, the heathen, and the 
Turks intend to be saved by their works.” (Art. IY, 22.) If with¬ 
in those churches which teach the pagan doctrine of work-righteous¬ 
ness individual persons still remain Christians, this is due to the 
surpassing grace of God, as the Apology rightly reminds us: 
“Therefore, even though Popes or some theologians and monks in 
the Church have taught us to seek remission of sins, grace, and 
righteousness through our own works and to invent new forms of 
worship, which have obscured the office of Christ and have made 
out of Christ not a Propitiator and Justifier, but only a Legislator, 
nevertheless the knowledge of Christ has always remained with 
some godly persons.” (Art. Ill, 271.) 

d. The doctrine of the Word of God. The Word of God, 

that is, the external Word of the holy Gospel, which Christ com¬ 
manded His blessed apostles to preach and teach to all nations 
(Matt. 28, 19. 20; Mark 16,15. 16) and which is set forth in Holy 
Scripture, is both the object and the means of saving faith. It is 
the object of saving faith because saving faith believes the Gospel, 
Mark 1,15; Rom. 1,1. 2; it is the means of saving faith since 
saving faith is engendered only through the Gospel, Rom. 10,17; 
1, 16; John 17, 20; Jas. 1, 18. Every “faith” that is not pro¬ 
duced by the Word of God is not faith, but a figment of 
the mind, or fancy. Such faith Luther rightly styles “faith in 
the air.” True, saving faith is always God-made, never man¬ 
made, 1 Tim. 6, 3. 1 Cor. 2,1—5: “That your faith should not 

stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.” For this 
reason the doctrine of the Word of God is likewise a fundamental 
doctrine. The penalty of the rejection of the Gospel is damnation, 
Mark 16,15.16. 

e. The doctrine of the resurrection. Modern rationalistic 
theology discards the Scriptural doctrine of the resurrection, deny¬ 
ing both Christ’s glorious resurrection and the resurrection of all 
the dead on Judgment Day. In place of the resurrection it teaches 
the immortality of the soul. Holy Scripture, however, affirms 
that the denial of the resurrection involves the denial of the entire 
Gospel of Christ, 1 Cor. 15, 12—19. It unqualifiedly condemns 
those who deny the resurrection as having made shipwreck of their 
faith and erred concerning the truth, 1 Tim. 1,19. 20; 2 Tim. 2, 
17.18. Hymenaeus and Alexander, who denied the doctrine of the 
resurrection, were delivered by St. Paul “unto Satan that they may 



52 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OK THEOLOGY. 


learn not to blaspheme.” The denial of the resurrection is there¬ 
fore tantamount to blasphemy of Christ. It is for this reason that 
we classify the doctrine of the resurrection among the fundamentals 
of the Christian religion. 

When we speak of the fundamental doctrines of the Christian 
religion, we of course mean these doctrines as they are presented 
in Holy Scripture, not the dogmatic formulation of these teachings, 
or the dogmas of the Church. Dogmas may be faulty; the teach¬ 
ings of Holy Scripture are infallible. Nevertheless it must be 
borne in mind that, whenever the doctrines of Holy Scripture have 
been formulated correctly, the rejection of such dogmas, or creeds, 
is nothing less than the rejection of Holy Scripture itself. Thus 
Modernists, who reject the Apostles’ Creed or the Nicene Creed or 
the Athanasian Creed, reject the very Word of God; for the doc¬ 
trines expounded and defended in these confessions are the teach¬ 
ings of Holy Scripture. 

Primary and Secondary Fundamental Doctrines. 

The fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion may be 
divided into primary and secondary fundamental doctrines. This 
distinction is not only Scriptural, but also practical and useful, for 
it helps the Christian theologian to discriminate rightly between the 
fundamental doctrines themselves. As we have learned, funda¬ 
mental doctrines are such as constitute the foundation of the Chris¬ 
tian faith; yet not all fundamental doctrines constitute this 
foundation in the same manner. Hollaz rightly observes: “All 
the fundamental articles of faith must necessarily be known, but 
the grades of this necessity are different.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 99.) 
Thus the primary fundamental articles are of such absolute im¬ 
portance that, if they are denied, there is no foundation whatever 
on which saving faith may rest. All the doctrines enumerated be¬ 
fore under the heading “Fundamental Articles of Faith” are to be 
classified as primary fundamental articles; for if these are cast 
aside, Christianity cannot exist. 

Secondary fundamental doctrines, on the other hand, while 
also serving as a foundation of faith, do not do so primarily and 
absolutely. Examples of secondary fundamental doctrines are 
those of Holy Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. These two Sacra¬ 
ments, instituted by Christ have been given to us as a founda¬ 
tion of faith besides the Gospel; for the same grace and forgive¬ 
ness proffered and conveyed to us in the Word of God are proffered 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


53 


and conveyed to us also in them. Acts 2, 38: “Repent and be bap¬ 
tized, every one of you, for the remission of sins.” Matt. 26, 28 
(Luke 22,19f.) : "This is My blood of the new testament, which 
is shed for many for the remission of sins.” On this gracious 
offer of pardon, sealed by Christ in the Sacraments, the Christian 
faith rests, and in the same manner and to the same degree as it 
rests on our Lord’s offer of pardon in the Word. For this reason 
the doctrines of Holy Baptism and Holy Communion are funda¬ 
mental; they are the foundation of the Christian’s faith. Never¬ 
theless a person may be ignorant of these doctrines, or he may 
even err with regard to them and yet be saved, provided he clings 
to the promise of forgiveness offered in the Gospel. The reason 
for this is obvious. The entire forgiveness which Christ has secured 
for sinners by His death on the cross is offered and conveyed to 
the believer in the Gospel, so that, if he trusts in the Gospel 
promise, he possesses by faith all the merits of Christ, together 
with spiritual life and eternal salvation. This does not mean 
that the sacramental promise is superfluous. The Christian 
Church can never dispense with the Sacraments, since they convey 
the spiritual blessings of the Savior in a particularly close and 
comforting manner. The Sacraments are the visible Word (Ver- 
bum visibile) and the individual application (applicatio indi- 
vidualis) of divine grace. But the Christian believer who trusts 
in the divine promise of pardon which is offered in the Gospel to 
all men is already in possession of salvation. The Sacraments offer 
nothing new; they only seal and confirm the same grace and the 
same absolution which the Gospel announces, gives, and confers. 
In this sense the Sacraments are not absolutely necessary; and for 
this reason we call the doctrines of Holy Baptism and Holy Com¬ 
munion secondary fundamental doctrines. Nor should we reject 
this distinction; for it points out to us where we must draw the 
line between Christians and non-Christians. Thus the believing 
children of God in the Reformed churches err with regard to the 
essence and purpose of the Sacraments, and this error we must 
regard as one which is both dangerous and pernicious. Still they 
trust in the grace which is offered to them in the Gospel, and as 
long as they do that, we cannot deny that they have the saving 
faith. In other words, we must still regard them as Christians, 
though as weak and erring Christians and such as constantly en¬ 
danger their state of grace by not accepting the whole Word of 
Christ. What has just been said of the children of God in the 



51 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


Reformed churches pertains also to the believers in other sects and 
in the Roman Catholic Church. As long as a believer trusts in 
the grace of Christ offered in the Word, as did the thief on the 
cross, he is saved, even though he has never received the bless¬ 
ings of the Sacraments. Hollaz is quite right in saying of 
the secondary fundamental articles as such: “A simple want of 
acquaintance with them does not prevent salvation, but the perti¬ 
nacious denial of, and hostility to, them overturns the foundation 
of faith.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 99.) 

In his remark concerning the secondary fundamental doc¬ 
trines, Hollaz directs our attention to a very important truth. The 
distinction between primary and secondary fundamental doctrines 
must never be abused in the interest of tolerating false doctrine. 
A pertinacious denial of, and manifest hostility to, the secondary 
fundamental doctrines, the same as to all doctrines of Holy Scrip¬ 
ture, must in the end overturn the foundation of the faith; for this 
implies resistance offered to the Holy Spirit. Of this we must con¬ 
tinually remind all errorists, even if we cannot deny their state of 
grace. Let every Christian theologian remember: — 

a. That he is commanded by Christ to teach all the doctrines 
of God's Word and not to ignore or deny a single one. Matt. 
28, 20: “Teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have com¬ 
manded you.” 

b. That every departure from the Word of God, according to 
God’s express statement, is a scandal (axavdaXov), or offense. Rom. 
16,17: “Mark them which cause offenses contrary to the doctrine 
which ye have learned.” No theologian can teach errors without 
giving offense to others; and this is a most serious matter. Matt. 
18, 7: “Woe to that man by whom the offense cometh!” Cp. also 
Luke 17, 1. Rom. 14, 13: “That no man put a stumbling-block, 
or an occasion to fall, in his brother’s way.” 2 Cor. 6, 3: “Giving 
no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed.” 

c. That every one who sets aside the clear testimony of God’s 
Word in a single point rejects the entire Word of God as the only 
source and standard of faith; for Holy Scripture must be believed 
and taught not merely in its general application, but all its parts, 
indeed all its words, must be accepted as divine truth. Luther 
rightly says: “The Holy Spirit [speaking in Holy Scripture] can¬ 
not be separated or divided, so that He should teach and have us 
believe one doctrine as true and another as false.” (St. L., XX, 
1871.) All the teachings of God’s Word are so intimately inter- 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


55 


woven with one another that, if one is denied, all the rest are 
likewise affected by such denial; that is to say, “one error produces 
another,” as the history of dogma proves. If there are exceptions 
to this rule, they must be attributed to the wonderful sustaining 
grace of God alone. Due to God’s grace an erring theologian some¬ 
times, by a strange “fortunate inconsistency,” does not personally 
believe what he officially teaches; or again, he does not, in his own 
life of faith, draw the deadly inferences which his rationalistic 
rejection of divine truth suggests. Thus many a synergist who 
officially affirmed man’s cooperation in conversion in his own per¬ 
sonal dealings with God as a penitent sinner disavowed this per¬ 
nicious error and trusted for salvation in God’s grace alone. Again, 
erring theologians who publicly and officially denied the univer¬ 
sality of divine grace nevertheless proclaimed and asserted the uni¬ 
versal character of God’s grace and of Christ’s redemption when 
they preached the Gospel to the common people. This fortunate 
difference between theory and practise they owed to the unspeakable 
mercy of God, who earnestly desires the salvation of sinners. 

However, also this truth must not be abused to promote indif¬ 
ference in doctrine. While we admit that there is a “fortunate 
inconsistency,” we must remember that there is an “unfortunate 
consistency,” by which theologians who offend in one point are led 
to offend in many points and even in all. In other words, the 
proclamation of one error consistently leads to the proclamation 
of others and in the end to the denial of the entire Scriptural 
truth. Against this fatal consequence of denying God’s Word and 
indulging in error Luther earnestly warns all Christian theologians 
when he writes: “You must not say, I purpose to err as a Chris¬ 
tian. Christian erring occurs only from ignorance.” (St. L., XIX, 
1132.) Luther admits that there is such an anomaly as “Christian 
erring”; that is to say, even a true Christian at times errs due to 
weakness or to ignorance. But this “Christian erring” becomes 
an “unchristian erring” as soon as a person deliberately and know- 
ingly yields to error. Such “unchristian erring” must needs over¬ 
turn the foundation of faith and endanger salvation. Let the 
Christian theologian, then, be warned. Indifferentism with respect 
to the doctrines of Holy Scripture and spiritual unionism resulting 
therefrom are diametrically opposed to God’s Word, which declares: 
“A man that is an heretic, after the first and second admonition 
reject, knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth, 
being condemned of himself,” Titus 3, 10. 11. Holy Scripture 



56 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


never justifies the teaching of error, but always and most vehe¬ 
mently condemns it as an offense, oxavdaXov. 

d. That the whole Church, in order to preserve unadul¬ 
terated the purity of doctrine, must continually guard against 
every error by which Satan would cause divisions and offenses. To 
this end it must rebuke even the slightest error and departure from 
the truth that is in Christ Jesus. Gal. 5, 9: “A little leaven 
leaveneth the whole lump.” It is the "little leaven” of false 
doctrine with which the whole corruption of the entire Christian 
theology usually begins. Modernism, with its crass rejection of 
all the Scriptural truths that are necessary to salvation, is but 
the result of the indifferentism of such theologians and churches 
as allowed the “little leaven” a place in their system of dogmas. 
Let errorists deny the doctrine of verbal inspiration, and the whole 
doctrine of inspiration will fall. Let the sola gratia be removed 
from the corpus doctrinae, and the rejection of Christ’s vicarious 
atonement will follow. The Christian theologian cannot err in 
“little things” without sooner or later erring also in the “great 
things” of salvation. That is the “unfortunate consistency” of 
tolerating error. How deadly it is all earnest Christians know 
who have studied the history of the Christian Church in the light 
of Holy Scripture. 

Non-Fundamental Doctrines. 

Non-fundamental doctrines of Holy Scripture are such as do 
not constitute the foundation of faith, inasmuch as they do not 
offer and convey to sinners forgiveness of sins and thus make them 
children of God through faith in Christ. They do not form the 
foundation of saving faith, but rather strengthen the faith which 
already exists. Hollaz describes non-fundamental doctrines as 
“parts of the Christian doctrine which one may be ignorant of 
or omit and yet be saved” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 92). Such doctrines 
are, for example, those of the angels, of Antichrist, etc. As we see, 
these doctrines do not create saving faith in Christ, but they are 
given for the comfort or warning of those who already believe in 
Christ. This does not mean that the non-fundamental doctrines 
are useless; in many respects their importance is indeed very great, 
and so they may not be dispensed with. Thus the doctrine con¬ 
cerning the holy angels glorifies divine grace and strengthens our 
faith in God’s merciful providence. Both quantitatively and quali¬ 
tatively this doctrine constitutes a weighty part of Christian 
theology. This fact the Christian theologian must never overlook. 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


57 


Again, the doctrine concerning Antichrist instructs with regard to, 
and warns us against, the greatest fraud ever perpetrated within 
Christendom, and evangelical theology would suffer a most serious 
loss if this doctrine were eliminated. Accordingly also the non¬ 
fundamental doctrines are necessary and must be inculcated with 
becoming earnestness and emphasis. 2 Tim. 3,16: "All Scripture 
is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for 
reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” Never¬ 
theless the non-fundamental doctrines are not properly the object 
of saving faith; for faith relies on the gracious Gospel-promise of 
pardon through faith in the redemption of Jesus Christ; in this 
sense alone they are non-fundamental. Whoever declares them to 
be non-fundamental in the sense that they can be dispensed with 
denies both the divine authority and the perfection of Holy Scrip¬ 
ture and thus denies a fundamental doctrine. Baler’s warning with 
regard to this matter should be heeded here. He writes: "At 
the same time [while we admit that there are nonr-fundamental 
doctrines] we are to be careful in regard to this point lest by 
embracing or professing error we rashly sin against divine revela¬ 
tion and God Himself; especially, lest through the persuasion of 
others something be maintained, contrary to conscience, through 
which the foundation and the truth of one or more of the funda¬ 
mental articles of the faith are overturned. For thus, as by a mor¬ 
tal sin, faith and the Holy Spirit may be, and are, entirely driven 
away.” (Doctr. Theol., p. 97.) This warning applies also to the 
historical, archeological, and scientific facts and statements con¬ 
tained in Holy Scripture. While these are not fundamental, we 
wickedly reject the divine authority of Holy Scripture if we pre¬ 
sume to deny them to be absolutely true; for an erring Scripture 
is not authoritative. Indeed, an errant Bible cannot be believed 
at all; for if it is false in non-fundamental points, how can it 
be true in its fundamental teachings? If we cannot rely on it 
when it teaches us earthly things, how much less can we do so 
when it speaks of heavenly things. Hence, while the Christian 
theologian acknowledges non-fundamental doctrines in Holy Scrip¬ 
ture, he believes and declares the entire Holy Scripture, in all its 
parts and in all its statements, to be the divine truth which must 
be proclaimed to men. The distinction between fundamental and 
non-fundamental doctrines is made by him merely to distinguish 
clearly between those teachings of God which are the foundation 
of justifying faith and those which are not.

C. OPEN QUESTIONS, OB THEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. 

Open questions must not be defined as points of doctrine “on 
which men cannot agree” or “which the Church has left undecided 
in its Confessions,” but as questions which Holy Scripture itself 
has left open, or unanswered, or has not answered clearly. This 
definition of open questions is very important; for not human, 
but only Scriptural authority determines what must be taught in 
the Christian Church, namely, the entire content of Holy Scrip¬ 
ture, Matt. 28, 20; not a definite doctrinal platform which certain 
theologians or churches have drawn up. In other words, Holy 
Scripture alone is the spiritual teacher of men, not the Church or 
the theologian in the Church. The spirit of indifferentism and 
unionism has always set up false standards regarding the issue of 
open questions. Guided by a vicious principle of religious tolera¬ 
tion, theologians again and again have erred on this point by exalt¬ 
ing their limited human reason above the inspired Word of God 
and “opening” or “closing” questions at their own will. Over 
against this unscriptural practise it must be maintained that open 
questions owe their existence alone to the silence of Scripture 
and not to any fixation of doctrine by the Church or to any policy 
of expediency advocated by parties in controversy. Since the doc¬ 
trine of Holy Scripture is God’s Word, men have no right what¬ 
ever to decide what to teach and what not to teach or to deter¬ 
mine which should be closed and which should be open questions. 
That is a matter outside their jurisdiction. 

As we study Holy Scripture, we find that, in agreement with 
its scope and purpose, it does not answer every question which 
men may desire to have answered. For instance, it does not ex¬ 
plain how sin originated or could originate since all creatures were 
originally created “very good.” Nor does Holy Scripture answer 
the question whether the soul of a child comes into being either 
by creation or traduction (creationism; traducianism). Questions 
on which the Word of God is silent we call theological problems, 
or open questions. To these questions we may add also the crux 
theologorum, which has always puzzled the minds of inquisitive 
theologians: Why are some converted and others not, though by 
nature all men are in the same guilt (eadern culpa) and are saved 
by grace alone (sola gratia) f (Cur alii, alii nonf Cur non omnesf 
Cur alii prae aliisf) Since God’s Word does not answer these 
questions, the theologian should not endeavor to do so. All 
attempts to do so are both anti-Scriptural, because the theologian 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


59 


is to speak only as the oracles of God, 1 Pet. 4,11, and unscientific, 
since he who takes it upon himself to answer such questions pre¬ 
sumes to know what he cannot know. Divine truth is apprehended 
only through faith, or by simply believing what Holy Scripture 
teaches. John 8, 31. 32. Hence, whatever doctrine is drawn from 
any other source than Christ’s Word is not theology, but mere 
speculation or downright ignorance, 1 Tim. 6, 4. 

The proper attitude of the Christian theologian toward open 
questions, or theological problems, is therefore that of confessing 
that he is incapable of solving them since the source of his faith. 
Holy Scripture, furnishes him no data. Eeusch very pertinently 
says: " Inutilis est eorum cognitio, et vanae sunt de eisdem dispu- 
tationes.” (Annotationes in Baieri Comp., 1757, p. 52.) However, 
such disputations are not only useless, but directly dangerous. Of 
this Luther reminds us when he says that the Gospel is hindered 
mainly by two things, namely, first, if sinners are taught to trust 
in their good works, and secondly, if useless questions are pro¬ 
pounded the answering of which causes the chief parts of the 
Christian doctrine to be neglected. (St. L., IX, 863 ff.) Open 
questions are certainly not “open” in the sense that the Christian 
theologian may allow his imagination to run wild on matters which 
God has wisely refused to reveal. If he indulges in speculations, 
these must always be kept within the bounds of the analogy of 
faith, or the clear revelation of God’s Word. But it is safer and 
better for a theologian not to speculate at all, since his own views 
may easily lodge in his theological system and be taught as a part 
of divinely revealed truth. Let the Christian theologian learn to 
say nescio wherever Holy Scripture does not speak with clearness 
and definiteness, remembering that both in revealing truths and in 
withholding facts which we should like to know God had in mind 
our salvation, 2 Tim. 3,15—17. 

In this connection we may discuss also the important question, 
“What are articles of faith?” Articles of faith, as our dogma- 
ticians have always affirmed, have their origin solely in Holy 
Scripture. That means that the Christian Church accepts and 
believes only such doctrines as are unmistakably taught in Holy 
Scripture. Hollaz describes an article of faith as “a part of the 
doctrine revealed in the written Word of God concerning God and 
divine things and proposed to the sinner to be believed for his 
salvation.” However, since it is true that some articles of 
faith contain truths which man’s natural knowledge of God and 



60 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


the contemplation of God’s works in nature disclose to him, for 
example, those concerning the existence of God, the articles of 
faith have been divided into mixed articles, that is, such as are 
manifest also from the light of nature, and pure articles, or such 
as are known only from the study of Holy Scripture. (Baier.) 
But also the former, the mixed articles, are articles of faith only 
inasmuch as they are directly taught in God’s Word. The true 
Christian theologian recognizes no source of divine truth other 
than the Bible. 

12. THE CHURCH AND ITS DOGMAS. 

Since the Christian theologian is to teach only what Holy 
Scripture teaches and nothing else, the question has been raised 
whether creeds, dogmas, or confessions are rightfully given a place 
in the Christian Church. The question has been denied by both 
conservative and modernistic theologians. Modernistic theology 
favors a creedless, or undogmatic, Christianity. Its plea is that the 
real function of the Church is to spread the “social gospel” and 
not the supernatural Gospel of Christ, with which our present 
advanced age is no longer in sympathy. Modernistic theology is 
therefore absolutely present-worldly, not otherworldly. It proposes 
a theology for this life, not one for the life to come (eine Dies- 
seitigskeits-, nicht eine Jenseitstheologie) . This theology, so it is 
claimed, is one of good works, to be done now, and not one of 
comforting words with respect to a possible future existence. 
Because modernistic theology is so constituted, it regards creeds, 
dogmas, and confessions not only as unnecessary, but also as in¬ 
jurious. Creeds are said to impede the free progress and develop¬ 
ment of the Church and its activity. Thus modernistic theology 
must needs be opposed to dogmas. Modern theologians of a more 
conservative type oppose creeds for a somewhat different reason. 
Their claim is that dogmas and confessions prevent the necessary 
“progress in theology” (Lehrfortbildung), which must take place 
if the Church is to remain a living organism. In fact, this type 
of theologian holds that the doctrines of the Church are ever- 
living and expanding factors, forever subject to change as newer, 
fuller, and deeper revelations are given to men. Therefore the 
Church must not be fettered by the chains of definite creeds, since 
these prevent the progress, or development, of doctrine. As we see, 
in the final analysis the difference between the two types of theo¬ 
logians is not so very great. It is a difference in degree, not in 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


61 


kind. Both reject Holy Scripture as the sole rule and norm of 
faith and in its place enthrone reason or science. 

From the objections just now considered it is obvious that the 
animosity of modern liberalistic and rationalistic theology is pri¬ 
marily directed not against the creeds, or dogmas, themselves, but 
against Holy Scripture. These rationalists object to creeds because 
they object to divinely revealed truths. Their creedless theology 
is tantamount to a theology without the Holy Bible. They wish to 
follow their own words, not the Word of God. 

This hatred against Holy Scripture is, however, found also in 
churches that favor creeds. Koman Catholic theology, for example, 
is built up entirely on definite creeds. Because the Church of Rome 
accepts the ancient confessions of the unadulterated Christian 
Church, we still consider it as being within the pale of Christendom. 
But it has hedged in these ancient creeds by later creeds whose 
tenor is antichristian and which actually make void what the 
ancient Christian confessions declare. Moreover, these specifi¬ 
cally papistical creeds are in direct opposition to Holy Scripture, 
for they reject Scripture as the only rule of faith and flatly con¬ 
tradict its central doctrines. They affirm that the Pope as the 
head of the Church is the infallible norm of faith, that a sinner is 
justified by works, that the doctrine of justification by grace, 
through faith in Christ, is anathema, that the merits and inter¬ 
cessions of the saints avail for salvation, and so forth. Such creeds 
quite obviously do not deserve a place in the Christian Church; 
for they are not Christian, but antichristian. But also in the Cal- 
vinistic churches we find creeds that stand in opposition to the 
pure Word of God. The specifically Calvinistic creeds deny the 
universality of God’s grace and of Christ’s redemption, the efficacy 
of the means of grace, the true presence of our Lord’s body in the 
Holy Supper, the communion of natures in the person of Christ, 
and the resulting communication of attributes, etc. Such creeds 
must not be tolerated in the Christian Church because they are 
unscriptural and rationalistic. 

The Christian Church, which has for its source of faith only 
the infallible Word of God (Eph. 2, 20), must under no condition 
acknowledge as right and legitimate any dogma, or doctrine, which 
is not a clear teaching of Holy Scripture. Or we may say: The 
dogma of the Christian Church is the doctrine of the Holy Bible. 
Whatever the written Word of God declares and teaches is eo ipso 
a church dogma, no matter whether it is especially formulated 



62 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


or not. The question is not: Is this or that doctrine clearly stated 
in the Confessions ? but: Is this or that doctrine set forth in God’s 
Word ? If it is set forth in Holy Writ, it is for this reason a church 
dogma, even though not a word is said about it in the Confessions 
of the Church. The reason for this is not difficult to perceive. 
The Christian Church is not the lord of God’s doctrine, but only 
its servant. Its paramount purpose is not to create new doctrines, 
but to preach the doctrines which its divine Lord has revealed. 
Matt. 28, 20: “Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever 
I have commanded you.” Luther’s dictum applies here with full 
force: “The Church of God has no authority to establish any article 
of faith, just as it never has established any nor ever will estab¬ 
lish any.” So also Quenstedt rightly says (1, 36): “Divine reve¬ 
lation is the first and last source of sacred theology, beyond which 
theological discussion among Christians dare not proceed.” ( Doctr . 
Theol., p. 28.) This does not mean that the Church should not 
have any articles of faith or any confessions, but it does mean that 
all its articles of faith must be in deed and truth “declarations” 
of the faith that has been delivered to it by God in His holy Word. 
Thus Christians universally accept the ancient confessions of the 
Christian Church because these profess and defend nothing but 
Scripture doctrine. This is true even though the technical theo¬ 
logical terms which they employ to express the doctrine of God’s 
Word, such as “Trinity,” “consubstantial,” etc., are not found in 
Holy Scripture. So also the specifically Lutheran Confessions, 
which were added at the time of the Reformation and after Luther’s 
death to defend the doctrine of the Word of God against Romanism, 
sectarianism, and enthusiasm, profess only Scripture doctrine. We 
say this not in a spirit of carnal pride, but in the holy conviction 
of that loyalty to Christ and His Word which He demands of His 
disciples. Dogmas (creeds, confessions) have a rightful place in 
the Christian Church provided they teach the doctrines of God 
and not doctrines of men. If, however, they set forth doctrineB 
in opposition to God’s Word, they must be renounced and rejected; 
for the Christian Church must teach the Word of its divine Lord, 
nothing else. 

What has just been said of dogmas and creeds in general 
applies with equal force to the theological treatises of individual 
teachers of the Church. No theologian should be listened to in 
the Church, and no dogmatic treatise should be regarded as worthy 
of consideration, unless they profess and defend the truth which is

in Christ Jesus. The dogmatician who draws his teachings from 
any other source than Holy Scripture perpetrates an inexcusable 
fraud upon the Church and deserves excommunication from the 
Church as a false prophet, Eom. 16,17; 2 John 10.11; 1 Tim. 
4,16. God’s earnest and persistent demand is: “If any man speak, 
let him speak as the oracles of God,” 1 Pet. 4, 11. This applies 
to all ministers and teachers who have been called to instruct the 
Christian people in general. Christian ministers, teachers, and 
missionaries must proclaim to their hearers God’s Word, not their 
own, so that in the whole Christian Church, in its schools and col¬ 
leges, in its churches and homes, not one doctrine is taught that is 
not in agreement with Holy Scripture. 

If the dogmas and creeds of the Church are truly and abso¬ 
lutely Scriptural, they are of great value also for preserving the 
inner connection of the various theological disciplines and securing 
their truly theological character. Commonly we speak of theology 
as dogmatic, historic, exegetic, and practical. This division is both 
practical and useful. It assists the theological student in dis¬ 
tinguishing one subject from the other and so prevents confusion 
as he takes up the study of sacred theology. Nevertheless, in the 
final analysis the purpose of the various theological disciplines is 
the same; each is to teach God’s Word together with its specific 
applications. The dogmatic theologian inculcates with special 
emphasis the several doctrines of Holy Scripture; the exegetic 
theologian sets forth the same doctrines while he expounds to his 
hearers the meaning of the words of the sacred text; the his¬ 
toric theologian exhibits the same doctrines as they react upon 
men in history; and the practical theologian applies the same 
doctrines to the special needs of the Christian congregation. While, 
therefore, the four theological disciplines may be distinguished 
from one another by their particular scope, they all center in the 
one paramount purpose of proclaiming, expounding, and defending 
the Word of God; and this one purpose, the teaching of God’s 
Word, preserves their inner connection, unifying the whole course 
of theology. At the same time this one purpose of inculcating 
God’s Word preserves also the truly theological character of each 
discipline. It is this factor that makes historic theology, or exe¬ 
getic theology, or practical theology, theology in the true sense of 
the term. If historic theology goes beyond the Word of God, it is 
no longer theological; and the same is true of dogmatic, exegetic, 
and practical theology. In short, these branches are theology only 



64

in as far as they teach and expound the Word of God set forth 
in Holy Scripture. As soon as theologians present their own views, 
they are teaching philosophy or speculation, not theology; for this 
is as much the Word of God as it is the word about God. 

In view of the general apostasy among theologians to-day the 
truth just stated certainly requires constant emphasis. The crisis 
that troubles the Christian Church to day calls for renewed loyalty 
to the Word of God. If the Church is to be healed from its mani¬ 
fold ills, it must apply the age-old precious remedy which God has 
ordained for the salvation of men, the unadulterated Word of God. 
Christ’s command is: “Preach the Gospel,” Mark 16, 15. That 
divine injunction binds all Christians, and in particular all Chris¬ 
tian teachers, to the Word of God for all time. “Quod non est bibli- 
cum, non est theologicum.” This is an axiom which the Chris¬ 
tian Church must ever respect and heed; if it fails to do this, it 
is an apostate Church and dishonors our Lord, who built His 
Church on the foundation of the prophets and apostles. He Him¬ 
self being the chief Corner-stone. 

13. THE PURPOSE OF CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY. 

In the performance of his sacred functions the Christian theo¬ 
logian must at all times conscientiously keep in mind the true ob¬ 
jective of his theological activity. The purpose of sacred theology, 
so far as it regards lost and perishing mankind, is not the spread 
of culture, nor the establishment of civic righteousness on earth, 
nor the satisfaction of the intellectual craving of the human mind, 
nor the enrichment of human knowledge, but the eternal salvation 
( oa)Ti]Qia , salus aeterna) of sinners. In other words, the purpose 
of sacred theology is not academic or speculative, but intensely and 
absolutely practical (habitus practicus); it is to lead perishing 
souls to Christ and through Him to communion with the true God, 
here in time inchoatively and hereafter in eternity perfectly. This 
exalted purpose of Christian theology Holy Scripture expressly 
states in indisputable terms. 1 Tim. 4,16: “Take heed unto thy¬ 
self and unto the doctrine . . . ; for in doing this, thou shalt both 
save thyself and them that hear thee.” Mark 16,15.16: “Preach 
the Gospel. ... He that believeth . . . shall be saved.” If modern 
rationalistic theology rejects eternal salvation as the primary and 
preeminent purpose of sacred theology, it is because this obnoxious 
type of pseudotheology is not Biblical, but carnal; not the divine 
theology of Christ’s Gospel, but the man-made theology of a social

65 


gospel. The Lutheran dogmatician Meisner is right when he de¬ 
clares : “Whoever does not continually pursue, and keep in mind 
in his entire study (Theorie), this purpose [the salvation of men] 
does not deserve the name of a true theologian.” ( Lehre und 
Wehre, 14, 76.) 

In accordance with the principle just stated the Lutheran 
divines have defined the purpose of sacred theology as follows: 
“Sacred theology occupies itself with man inasmuch as he is 
a sinner and must be restored to eternal salvation.” This defini¬ 
tion is truly Scriptural. The object of sacred theology is not 
man in general, but homo peccator, or sinful man, for whose sal¬ 
vation God has sent His only-begotten Son into the world “that 
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting 
life,” John 3,16. True, also the state, or the civil government, 
deals with men as sinners (homines peccatores), but its purpose is 
not the eternal salvation of men, but only their earthly, or temporal, 
welfare, in particular the protection of human life and property. 
Its interest therefore attaches only to this present life, not to the 
life that is to be after death. The state has therefore no jurisdic¬ 
tion in the sphere of a man’s spiritual and eternal life; its func¬ 
tions cease where this begins. However, to offer to, and bestow 
upon, sinful men eternal happiness in the life to come, and this 
through faith in Christ Jesus, engendered by the divinely insti¬ 
tuted means of grace, that is the special and proper function of 
sacred theology. Its message to fallen mankind reads: “He that 
believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth 
not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on 
him,” John 3, 36. 

The final purpose of sacred theology (finis ultimus) is there¬ 
fore the eternal salvation of men. The intermediate purpose (finis 
intermedins) may be defined as the generation and preservation of 
saving faith in Christ Jesus unto life eternal. Rom. 1, 5: “By 
whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the 
faith among all nations, for His name” (that men of all nations 
might be led to obey Christ in true faith). The Christian theo¬ 
logian therefore performs his holy office, first of all, in order that 
sinners may believe in Christ and obtain salvation through Him. 
But sacred theology effects not only conversion, but also sanctifica¬ 
tion and good works. This objective the Christian theologian must 
constantly bear in mind, urging with holy zeal those entrusted to 
his care to be zealous of good works. Titus 3, 8: “These things 

5 


CHRI8TIAN DOGMATICS. 



66 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


I will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed 
in God might be careful to maintain good works.” However, good 
works are not the means by which eternal salvation is obtained, 
but rather the effects and fruits of faith. Good works, in the 
Scriptural sense of the term, are such works as are done by those 
who already have obtained salvation through faith in Christ. 
Rom. 3, 28: “A man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the 
Law”; 6, 22: “But now, being made free from sin and become 
servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness.” Eph. 2, 10: 
“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good 
works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in 
them.” From this it follows that all who preach good works as 
a condition or means of salvation are under the curse. Gal. 3,10. 
On the other hand, the Christian minister who in accordance with 
Holy Scripture proclaims salvation by God’s grace alone, through 
the very preaching of the Gospel truly produces good works that 
please God and glorify Him. Titus 2,14: “Who gave Himself for 
us that He might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto 
Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.” 1 Tim. 6,18: 
“That they be rich in good works.” This does not mean that the 
Christian theologian neglects the divine Law, for the divine Law 
is the Word of God just as truly as the Gospel. But he employs 
the Law in its rightful place, to show what good works are and 
what God demands of the believer with regard to them. The will¬ 
ingness and power to do good works, however, he produces alone 
through the preaching of the Gospel. The Christian theologian 
must therefore be able rightly to apply both the Law and the 
Gospel. 

14. THE EXTERNAL MEANS BY WHICH SACRED 

THEOLOGY ACCOMPLISHES ITS PURPOSE OF 
SAVING SINNERS. 

The external means which the Christian theologian employs 
to accomplish the salvation of sinners are not the carnal weapons 
suggested by man’s wisdom, such as external coercion, the sword 
of the civil government, legal enactments, social service, the per¬ 
fecting of church organization, etc. On such things theologians 
are prone to rely if they are guided by principles of reason, as the 
history of the Christian Church proves. Erring theologians within 
the Christian Church have always advocated carnal means to main¬ 
tain and spread church power. Holy Scripture, however, condemns 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


67 


these means, not only as unprofitable, but as even downright 
injurious. For all of them are based upon the Law; and while the 
Law can check the gross outbursts of sin and improve the sinner 
outwardly, it cannot change his heart by producing in it true faith 
in Christ. But where there is no true faith in Christ, there is also 
no salvation. Hence the only means by which the Christian theo¬ 
logian can accomplish his preeminent, divinely prescribed purpose 
of saving sinners unto eternal life is the Gospel of Christ. Matt. 
28,19. 20: “Go ye therefore and make disciples of all nations by 
baptizing them . . . , teaching them to observe all things whatso¬ 
ever I have commanded you.” Mark 16,15: “Preach the Gospel to 
every creature.” Acts 20, 32 : “I commend you ... to the Word of 
His grace, which is able to build you up.” 2 Tim. 3,15 : “Thou hast 
known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto 
salvation.” Rom. 10,17: “Faith cometh by hearing and hearing 
by the Word of God.” These divine injunctions of Holy Scripture 
the Christian theologian must constantly bear in mind in order 
that he may not be misled toward relying on any means suggested 
and advanced by his carnal heart, but may exclusively employ the 
powerful, living Word of God, by which alone sinners are trans¬ 
formed into children of God and governed and kept through faith 
unto salvation. In the Christian Church, as in the entire activity 
of the Christian theologian, the Word of God must rule alone. It is 
the only efficacious means of grace because it alone is prescribed 
by God. Luther very correctly declares: “Christians cannot be 
ruled by any other means than by the Word of God; for Chris¬ 
tians must be ruled by faith, not by external measures. Faith, 
however, can come only through God’s Word, not through any 
word of man, as St. Paul teaches, Rom. 10,17: ‘Faith cometh by 
hearing and hearing by the Word of God.’ ” (St. L., X, 406.) Let 
the Christian theologian, then, rely alone on God’s Word for the 
successful execution of the work of the holy ministry; for it alone 
is the imperishable foundation of Christ’s holy Church. Cp. 1 Cor. 
3,10—14. 

15. THEOLOGY AND SCIENCE. 

The question whether the term science may be applied to 
sacred theology has caused no little debate among theologians. 
Some with great vehemence have affirmed it; others with the same 
vehemence have denied it. The question itself is not difficult to 
answer, provided the term science is used and understood precisely 
in the same meaning. It is quite obvious that the term science 



68 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


as employed in its common meaning cannot be applied to sacred 
theology. Christian theology is not a science in the same sense as, 
for instance, geology, psychology, biology, etc., are sciences. It dif¬ 
fers from these sciences not only in subject-matter, but also in 
source, method, and purpose. Its subject-matter is the divine truth, 
set forth in Holy Scripture; its source, the Holy Bible; its method 
(medium cognoscendi), faith; its purpose, the salvation of sinners. 
Sacred theology therefore does not deal with human knowledge, or 
man’s wisdom, obtained by human study, contemplation, or re¬ 
search, as do the common sciences established by philosophers and 
scientists. The Christian theologian gains his wisdom directly 
from the Bible, whose truths he receives by faith. The heart of 
sacred theology is the message of Christ’s vicarious atonement, 
which was revealed to men from heaven; for by nature man could 
not know or ascertain it, 1 Cor. 2, 6—10. By nature man can know 
only the divine Law, which God has written into his heart, Bom. 
1,18 ff.; 2,14.15. He has a natural knowledge of God, and this 
innate knowledge of divine things can be developed through reason 
and experience; both intensively and extensively it may be in¬ 
creased by contemplation and study. But the Gospel of Christ’s 
redemption does not lie within the natural knowledge of fallen man. 
It is a "mystery,” whose gracious revelation he owes entirely to 
God and which he knows alone through faith in Holy Scripture. 
From all this it is obvious that sacred theology cannot be called 
a science in the ordinary sense of the term. 

Again, sacred theology is not a science in the sense that it 
represents a higher Christian knowledge, which is above the simple 
religion of faith professed by the common Christian and which like 
the human sciences is capable of intellectual apprehension and 
logical demonstration. Sacred theology is not an advanced type of 
Christianity; it is not a philosophy of religion, but deals exclu¬ 
sively with the revealed truths of Holy Writ, which the theologian 
both accepts and apprehends by faith, John 8, 31. 32; Bom. 1, 5; 
1 Cor. 13,12. What the Christian theologian knows of divine, spir¬ 
itual things he knows only from the Word of God. If he knows 
more concerning the divine truths revealed by God than the ordi¬ 
nary believer, his knowledge exceeds that of the latter merely ex¬ 
tensively, not intensively; that is to say, he is conversant with the 
inspired truths of Holy Scripture to a greater extent simply be¬ 
cause he devotes more time to the study of the Holy Bible than 
the average Christian does. Hence the difference between the 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


69 


knowledge of the theologian and that of the ordinary Christian is 
one of degree, not one of kind. By this we mean to say that the 
theologian does not understand the divine mysteries of faith where¬ 
as the Christian church-member only believes them; for also the 
theologian knows only so much as he believes. To say it in other 
words, also with the Christian theologian, faith is knowledge, and 
knowledge is faith. The philosophical, philological, and historical 
facts which the theologian knows and operates with in contradis¬ 
tinction to the ordinary believer do not belong to the essence of 
Christian theology, but constitute merely the external scientific 
apparatus, or outward means, by which he approaches and studies 
Holy Scripture. They are merely his tools, or instruments, never 
a source of spiritual knowledge from which he is to draw opinions 
or doctrines beyond and contrary to the Word of God. The attempt 
of modern rationalistic theology to elevate the Christian faith to 
a science is nothing else than self-deception, and in the final 
analysis it is tantamount to the rejection of Holy Scripture as the 
only principle of Christian knowledge, or the only source of faith 
(prindpium cognoscendi). 

Nevertheless Christian theology may be rightly called a science 
if by that term we understand a definite knowledge, or accurate 
and reliable information, in opposition to mere views, opinions, 
and hypotheses. Understood in this sense, Christian theology is 
the science of sciences, or the science par excellence, the perfect 
science. This claim we make and sustain for Christian theology 
because it is God’s own infallible wisdom and not the fallible 
wisdom of man. To err is human (errare humanum est), but it is 
impossible for God to err (errare in Deum non cadit). John 
17,17: “Thy Word is truth.” John 10, 35 : “The Scripture can¬ 
not be broken.” Holy Scripture is in every part inerrant, and 
therefore Christian theology, which is drawn from Holy Scripture, 
is the most definite, most accurate, and most reliable, in fact, the 
only definite, the only accurate, and the only reliable science in 
the world. It is the divine science, which cannot err. 

This is the Christian conviction which every true Christian 
theologian must hold. If he does not have it, if he doubts the 
truth of what he declares and proclaims to his hearers, he is not 
a truly Christian theologian, but a reed shaken with the wind, and 
he has no business at all to teach or preach in the Christian Church. 
A Christian theologian must be so deeply convinced of the truth of 
his message that he is able to say with Paul: “But though we or 



70 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that 
which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed,” Gal. 1, 8. 
This truth must be emphasized over against modern agnostic the¬ 
ology, which denies the possibility of knowing the truth and claims 
that it is impossible for a theologian to be subjectively assured of 
his possessing the truth. This agnostic denial sets aside Christ's 
definite promise: “If ye continue in My Word, ... ye shall know 
the truth,” John 8, 31. 32. These words are Christ’s own guarantee 
that, if in true faith we accept His Word as it is set forth in 
Holy Writ and as we also possess and confess it in our Christian 
dogmas, creeds, and confessions, we shall become convinced of 
its absolute truth. Faith is always assurance of the truth as it 
is revealed in the Bible and presented in Christian theology, or 
doctrine. Nor is such assurance a mere personal or human con¬ 
viction (fides humana), produced by evidence of reason, but it is 
a divine assurance (fides divina), produced directly by the Holy 
Ghost through the Word of God. 1 Cor. 2, 5: “That your faith 
should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.” 
John 16, 13: “When He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will 
guide you into all truth.” By the Holy Spirit, through the ex¬ 
ternal Word of Holy Scripture, the Christian theologian is so 
guided into all truth that he can know and teach with absolute 
certainty the truth which is in Christ Jesus. 1 Cor. 2, 12: “We 
have received . . . the Spirit, which is of God, that we might know 
the things that are freely given to us of God.” True Christian 
theology is therefore no less certain than is Holy Scripture, and 
the Christian theologian must be no less assured of the truth of 
the doctrine which he teaches than He is of the objective truth of 
Holy Scripture. Luther very aptly remarks: “The Holy Spirit 
is no skeptic and has not written doubts or opinions in our hearts, 
but statements of fact, which are more certain and firm than life 
itself with all its experiences.” (St. L., XVIII, 1680.) — Christian 
theology is therefore justly called a science, because it is a knowl¬ 
edge that is absolutely true and certain. 

In spite of this fact, however, it is preferable not to define 
Christian theology primarily as a science, because the term science 
is subject to so much misunderstanding and downright abuse. 
Modern rationalistic theology invariably employs the term to denote 
by it the scientific demonstration of divine truth in accord with 
the principles of human reason. Fundamentally it regards the¬ 
ology as only a more exalted form of philosophy, and hence it 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


71 


applies to it the same principles and methods which are ordinarily 
employed to demonstrate philosophical truths. Against this mode 
of procedure the Christian theologian must needs object; for Chris¬ 
tian theology with its revealed mysteries is incapable of rational 
proof or intellectual demonstration. 1 Cor. 2,14: “The natural 
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, . . . neither can 
he know them.” As long as a person is unconverted, no amount of 
reasoning will render the divine truths of revelation acceptable 
to him; in fact, the more he allows his reason to mull over them, 
the more foolish and unreasonable they will seem to him. Hence 
philosophy can never lead to faith; invariably it leads away from 
true faith, as the “theology” of modem rationalistic theologians 
proves. Since, then, human reason is incapable of apprehending 
the divine mysteries of faith intellectually, Christ simply charged 
His apostles to preach the Gospel and not to demonstrate it ration¬ 
ally to men, Mark 16,15.16. They were to go out and proclaim 
the truth, but not to turn their divinely given message into 
a philosophical system acceptable to natural man. In accordance 
with this command, St. Paul testifies of his ministry at Corinth: 
“My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of 
man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,” 
1 Cor. 2, 4. 

On the basis of the truth just stated our dogmaticians defined 
sacred theology as a habitus exhibitivus, not as a habitus demon¬ 
strative. By this they meant to say that Christian theology is 
the ability to exhibit, or preach, the Gospel, but not to prove it 
true by human arguments of reason or philosophy. As the Christian 
theologian proclaims the truth, he wins souls for Christ, but not 
as he endeavors to prove true the mysteries of faith by principles 
of human reason. This also is the meaning of the axiom: “The 
best apology of the Christian religion is its proclamation.” Let the 
Gospel be made known, and it will of itself prove its divine char¬ 
acter. Christian apologetics has therefore only one function: it is 
to show the unreasonableness of unbelief. Never can it demon¬ 
strate the truth with “enticing words of man’s wisdom.” The 
reason for this is evident. Unbelief is as unreasonable as it is 
untrue; it projects the plea of intelligence, while at the bottom of 
it lies the vicious tendency to do that which is evil. John 3, 20: 
“For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh he 
to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.” To expose this 
malice of the carnal heart and to demonstrate the folly of infidelity 



72 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


in upholding its vicious claims is all that can be expected of Chris¬ 
tian apologetics. Never can Christian apologetics take the place of 
the simple preaching of the Word of God. — In this connection it 
may also be stated that there are no scientific reasons against 
the Christian faith. Wherever the Christian faith is opposed, the 
opposition has its source not in true science, but in vicious in¬ 
fidelity. The rejection of revealed divine truth can in no case be 
justified on reasonable grounds; it is the perverted reason of man 
only that disavows the truth which is in Christ Jesus. 

16. THEOLOGY AND POSITIVE ASSURANCE. 

In the preceding chapter we pointed out the truism that the 
Christian theologian must be personally sure of the truth which 
he teaches. The question how this positive subjective assurance 
may be secured (erkenntnis-theoretische Frage) is being dis¬ 
cussed with much vigor within both the conservative and the 
liberalistic camps. Quite commonly it is thought to be a problem 
involving most serious difficulties. These difficulties, however, ap¬ 
pear only if the theologian surrenders the objective truth of Holy 
Scripture. As long as he accepts Scripture as the only source and 
norm of faith, the question is indeed a most simple one. Our 
divine Lord teaches emphatically both that personal Christian as¬ 
surance exists and that it is obtained through faith in His Word. 
John 8, 31. 32: “If ye continue in My Word, ... ye shall know 
the truth.” This faith, which in itself is perfect assurance, is 
effected through the Word of God by the Holy Ghost. 1 Cor. 2, 5: 
“That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in 
the power of God.” Luther rightly says: “Man is certain pas¬ 
sively, just as the Word of God is certain actively.” (Homo esi 
certus passive, sicut Verbum Dei est cerium active.) That means 
according to Luther’s own explanation: “Where this [God’s] 
Word enters the heart with a true faith, it makes the heart as firm, 
sure, and certain as it is itself, so that it [the heart] becomes so 
absolutely firm and hard against every temptation, the devil, death, 
or whatever it may be that it boldly and proudly despises, and 
mocks at, everything that would doubt, tremble, be evil, or angry, 
for it knows that the Word of God cannot lie.” (St. L., Ill, 1887.) 
This statement is truly Scriptural. Personal, or subjective, assur¬ 
ance is most certainly obtained through the Word of God, and only 
through the Word of God, as Holy Scripture testifies. On the 
other hand, every kind of subjective assurance which does not flow 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


73 


from God’s Word through faith is self-made and hence nothing 
but ignorance and self-deception, 1 Tim. 6,3. 4. 

This is the Christian theologian’s reply to the false claim of 
modem rationalistic theology, which asserts that the real personal, 
or subjective, assurance is “self-assurance” (Selbstgeivissheit), or 
assurance which the theologian owes to his own regenerate self. 
This error, which was first proposed by Schleiermacher, has been 
quite generally adopted, even by theologians of the positive wing. 
This erroneous view rejects Holy Scripture as the only source and 
norm of faith; and so its advocates rely on their “Christian con¬ 
sciousness” or their “Christian experience” as the norm of their 
faith. Accordingly their “Christian theology” is built not exclu¬ 
sively on Holy Scripture, but on their “regenerate heart” or their 
own “sanctified ego”; and it is from this that they propose to 
derive their positive personal assurance of divine truth. But every 
assurance thus obtained must be rejected as false, since it is neither 
Christian nor scientific nor assurance at all. It is not Christian 
because it discards the specifically Christian foundation of faith; 
it is not scientific because it makes the human mind an authority 
in matters of which natural man is totally ignorant; it is, lastly, 
not assurance, but imagination, because the Christian theologian 
can know the divine truth only in so far as he continues in the 
Word of God. The unchristian character of modern rationalistic 
theology proves conclusively that it is impossible to draw the Chris¬ 
tian faith from any other source than Holy Scripture; for this 
brand of theology does not only reject the specific doctrines of the 
Christian religion, but it also sets up contradictory teachings in 
opposition to Holy Scripture and the Christian faith. Thus modern 
rationalistic theology denies the Scriptural doctrine of justification 
by grace, through faith, and teaches in its place salvation by work¬ 
righteousness. Such “assurance” therefore rests upon grounds 
which God’s Word positively condemns. 

In short, divine truth can be known by men, or what is the 
same thing, the human mind is capable of personal assurance of 
the divine truth. But this assurance is actual only if the theo¬ 
logian clings to Holy Scripture and in simple faith believes what 
God has spoken in His written Word. It is the unique character¬ 
istic of the Word of God both that it is absolute truth and that it 
renders the believer absolutely certain of its being such. If this is 
denied, the possibility and actuality of faith must likewise be 
denied; for personal assurance is nothing else than personal faith.

NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


17. THEOLOGY AND DOCTRINAL PROGRESS. 

Modem rationalistic theology of both wings, the conservative 
no less than the liberalistic, demands theological progress, or doc¬ 
trinal development, in accord with the advanced and ever-advancing 
religious vogues of the age (LehrfortbUdung). Its claim is that 
Christian theology cannot be stagnant, but must adjust itself to 
the varying views of the times. So insistent it is with regard to 
this matter that it brands all Christian theologians who oppose 
doctrinal development as unfaithful to their high commission. In 
modern rationalistic circles loyal theologians, who cling to Holy 
Scripture as the only norm of faith, are styled “repristinating 
theologians” (Repristinationstheologen), a term that implies both 
censure and contempt. 

However, as a matter of fact theological progress, or doctrinal 
development, is impossible and must be condemned as apostasy 
from the Christian faith. The reason for this is obvious. Accord¬ 
ing to Holy Scripture Christian theology constitutes a unit, which 
is complete and perfect in itself and hence incapable of either addi¬ 
tion or subtraction. Matt. 28, 20: “Teaching theih to observe all 
things whatsoever I have commanded you.” 2 Thess. 2,15: “Stand 
fast and hold the traditions [the doctrines] which ye have been 
taught.” Rev. 22,18: “If any man shall add unto these things, 
God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.” 
Christian theology, or Christian doctrine, is therefore, according to 
the express teachings of Holy Scripture, a fixed body of divine 
truths, which must never be altered, neither increased by human 
additions nor diminished by omissions of any kind. The Christian 
theologian must acknowledge and proclaim “all the counsel of God.” 
Cp. Acts 20, 20. 21. 27: “I kept back nothing that was profitable 
unto you, but have showed you and have taught you publicly and 
from house to house, testifying both to the Jews and also to the 
Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus 
Christ. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel 
of God.” In addition to this Holy Scripture very emphatically 
affirms that the Church of Christ is built “upon the foundation 
of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief 
Corner-stone,” Eph. 2, 20. The “foundation of the apostles and 
prophets” is the fixed doctrine which these holy men have written 
in Holy Writ by inspiration of the Holy Ghost. So also our Lord 
declares that those who are saved shall be saved through the Word 
of the apostles, John 17, 20. Moreover, the Word of God warns all 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


75 


believers most impressively against all errorists that pervert this 
fixed and definite Word either through addition or subtraction. 
Acts 20, 29: “After my departing shall grievous wolves enter in 
among you, not sparing the flock.” 1 Tim. 4, 1: “In the latter 
times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing 
spirits and doctrines of devils.” Hence both Christ and His 
apostles declare that the Christian doctrine is a perfect and com¬ 
plete body of inspired truths, which must be preserved pure and 
unadulterated. Every possibility of doctrinal progress, or develop¬ 
ment, is therefore excluded. Evolution in the realm of doctrine or 
theology is as preposterous and unscriptural as it is in the realm of 
nature, or creation. Holy Scripture affirms positively that the same 
God who made man also gave to him the divine doctrine by which 
he must be saved. Over this divine doctrine man has no jurisdic¬ 
tion; it is God’s sanctuary, which sinful man must not defile 
either by addition or subtraction, or, to use the modern euphemism, 
by doctrinal development. 

To this the objection has been raised that the Christian Church 
has at all times actually developed the Christian doctrine by estab¬ 
lishing creeds and confessions. But this objection involves an in¬ 
tolerable fallacy. In its creeds the Christian Church has never 
developed the Christian doctrine, but only declared the express 
doctrine of Holy Scripture in its full truth and purity against 
the errors of heretics and schismatics. Thus the Apostles’ Creed, 
the Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed, and the like, are not 
declarations of new, man-made teachings, but the very doctrines 
of Christ and His apostles set forth in Holy Scripture. When¬ 
ever the formulation of creeds necessitated the coining of terms 
not found in Holy Scripture (6/uoovoios, deoToxos, mere pas¬ 
sive, etc.), this was done only to present the Scriptural doctrine 
in clearer light, but never to foist man-devised and unscriptural 
teachings upon the Christian Church. So also the particular 
Lutheran Confessions are only specific declarations of the Scrip¬ 
tural doctrine against the errors of Romanism, Calvinism, and 
enthusiasm. Luther writes very truthfully: “We fabricate nothing 
new, but retain, and hold to, the old Word of God as the ancient 
Church confessed it; hence we are, just like it, the true ancient 
Church, teaching and believing the same Word of God. For this 
reason the papists blaspheme Christ Himself, the apostles, and 
the whole Christian Church when they call us innovationists and 
heretics. For they find nothing with us but the old [doctrine] of 
the ancient Church.” (St. L., XVII, 1324.) 



76 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


That theological progress, or doctrinal development, is in¬ 
trinsically impossible is proved experimentally by the fact that all 
attempts to develop the Christian doctrine have invariably led to 
the perversion of divine truth. Modern rationalistic theology, 
which champions doctrinal development as a prerequisite for the 
continued existence of the Church, has completely surrendered the 
very doctrines with which Christianity stands or falls, such as 
the doctrines of inspiration, of the vicarious atonement of Christ, 
of justification by grace alone, through faith, etc. Its doctrinal 
development has proved so fatal that it has virtually destroyed 
Christian theology and enthroned in its place a paganistic body of 
principles and teachings. And the reason for this is not hard to 
find. At the foundation of all doctrinal development lies the blind, 
perverse, and satanic rationalism of the carnal heart, which cannot 
bear the sound doctrine of God’s holy Word and consequently is de¬ 
termined to teach what is opposed to the saving truth which is in 
Christ Jesus. Our divine Lord condemned this rationalistic spirit 
of unbelief when He told the Pharisees: “Ye are of your father 
the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He abode not 
in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh 
a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar and the father of it,” 
John 8, 44. Let the Christian theologian remember that the Chris¬ 
tian religion is the absolute religion, which is so complete and per¬ 
fect in itself that St. Paul could write: “But though we or an 
angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that 
which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed,” Gal. 1, 8. 
If sound Biblical theology must go by the name of “repristination 
theology,” then let the Christian theologian glory in that term. 
For that is the only kind of theology which deserves a place in 
the Christian Church, since it is the only kind of theology which 
Jesus Christ, the Head and King of the Church, recognizes as true 
and divine. May God in His mercy retain in His Church “repris- 
tinating theologians”! For they are theologians after His heart, 
whom He will honor and glorify throughout eternity as the true 
builders of His Zion. 

18. THEOLOGY AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM. 

Modern rationalistic theology demands that the official teachers 
of the Church, both in the pulpit and in the lecture chair, should 
be invested with full academic freedom. That is to say, they should 
be allowed to assert their subjective opinions, without any restric¬ 
tions whatsoever; even Holy Scripture must not be forced upon 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


77 


them as the only source and standard of the faith which they are 
to inculcate. The ancient Christian rule that in the Christian 
Church the Word of God alone must be taught is rejected as “servi¬ 
tude of the letter,” “unworthy academic coercion,” “legalism,” etc. 
(Buchstabenknechtschaft, unwuerdiger Lehrzwang, gesetzlicher 
Oeist usw.). However, this demand for academic freedom is in 
■direct opposition to Holy Scripture; it is a freedom that is carnal 
and ungodly, since it involves full scope to criticize, condemn, and 
reject the Word of God. The academic freedom which modern 
rationalistic theology seeks for itself must therefore be repudiated 
as antichristian and atheistic; for it insists upon freedom from 
God and Christ. 

As a matter of fact the true freedom of a Christian con¬ 
sists in this, that he has been liberated from his own sin-bound 
will and has become a servant of Jesus Christ. Rom. 6, 22 : “But 
now being made free from sin and become servants of God.” The 
essence of true Christian liberty is therefore loyalty, obedience, and 
subjection to the Word of the Lord. John 8,31.32: “If ye con¬ 
tinue in My Word, then are ye My disciples indeed; and ye shall 
know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” As soon as 
the theologian relinquishes the Word of God as his only source 
and norm, he ceases to be a dovXog Xgiazov and becomes a slave 
of men. Then he has not obtained freedom at all, but has ex¬ 
changed the holy service of Christ for the unholy thraldom of 
human opinions, views, and judgments; in place of the divine 
Master he now serves a human taskmaster, even if this taskmaster 
is only his own carnal heart. How wrong it is for a theologian 
to demand freedom to teach his subjective views in place of the 
infallible Word of God becomes clear as we carefully consider what 
Holy Scripture teaches with respect to this. 

a. The Word of God affirms that the Christian Church till the 
end of time has only one Teacher, Christ Jesus, the Son of God. 
Matt. 23, 8: “But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your Master, 
even Christ; and all ye are brethren.” As the one Master, or 
Teacher, Christ commanded His apostles to teach all nations all 
things whatsoever He has commanded, Matt. 28, 20. Christ’s own 
divine Word as set forth by the holy prophets and apostles in the 
Scriptures is the only saving truth, which the Christian Church 
should believe and proclaim. Gal. 1,8: “But though we or an 
angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that 
which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” Eph. 2, 20: 
“And [ye] are built upon the foundation of the apostles and 



78 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


prophets.” In this manner Holy Scripture positively asserts that 
all teaching in the Christian Church should be nothing else than 
the teaching of God’s Word. Negatively, Holy Scripture condemns 
the inculcation of human opinion in place of the Word of God by 
calling all those who insist upon teaching doctrine other than 
Christ teaches in Holy Scripture, antichrists. 1 John 2,18: “As 
ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many 
antichrists”; v. 22: “Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus 
is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the 
Son.” The demand of modern rationalistic theology that the theo¬ 
logian must be given free scope to present his own theology is 
therefore thoroughly anti-Seriptural. 

b. All Christians are commanded in clear and unmistakable 
terms to hear such teachers only as proclaim the Word of God in 
its complete truth and purity. All theologians who are disloyal to 
the “words of our Lord Jesus Christ” should be rejected as de¬ 
ceivers, ignoramuses, and enemies of the faith and must be 
avoided. 2 John 10: “If there come any unto you and bring not 
this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him 
Godspeed.” 1 Tim. 6, 3. 4: “If any man teach otherwise and 
consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, ... he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting.” 
Rom. 16,17: “Mark them which cause divisions and offenses con¬ 
trary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them.” 
These warnings apply not only to ministers of the Gospel, but also 
to theological professors, who have been called to instruct the future 
teachers and preachers of the Christian Church. Also their Chris¬ 
tian call and profession requires of them that they be absolutely 
true to the Word of God in their whole ministry of teaching, 
John 8, 31. 32. 

The disastrous consequences of academic freedom granted to 
ministers and theological professors are apparent in all churches 
where such freedom has been in vogue. As a result of this ungodly 
freedom we find in these denominations: 1) hopeless confusion in 
doctrine and endless wrangling concerning theological problems, by 
which these churches have been made to suffer complete disruption 
( e . g., the denominations in which Modernists and Fundamentalists 
are engaged in interminable controversy); 2) the absolute denied 
of the bewic Christian truths taught in Holy Scripture, such as 
the divine inspiration of the Bible, the vicarious atonement of 
Christ, the justification of a sinner by grace, through faith, the 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


79 


resurrection of the dead, etc. Academic freedom resulted at once 
in “progressive theology,” that is, in the liberalizing of theology 
according to the standards of human reason and modern science, 
until it has become thoroughly anti-Biblical. Present-day Mod¬ 
ernism, which is the direct consequence of academic freedom, is 
a complete revolt against the sacred theology of God’s Word and 
is in itself the rejection of Biblical Christianity. 

The true Christian theologian rejoices in the possession of 
divine truth as offered in Holy Scripture, by which he has become 
free from every delusion and error. His constant endeavor is to 
make known to men bound and perishing in sin the saving and 
liberating truths of Christ, the divine Liberator of sin-lost men. 
Loyalty, obedience, and subjection to the Word of God constitute 
for him the supreme, glorious, and perfect liberty, which he must 
hold, guard, and protect against all odds. John 8, 36: “If the Son 
therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” It is for 
this reason that he so strenuously repudiates the academic freedom 
which unbelieving and unfaithful theologians now demand for 
themselves. 

19. THEOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. 

The peculiar nature of Christian theology has given rise to 
the question whether it is proper in the field of theology to speak 
of theological systems. The answer to the question depends of 
course on the meaning in which the term system, is used. Christian 
theology, or doctrine, is indeed a system inasmuch as it presents to 
the student a complete unit (ein abgeschlossenes Games). It is 
a system inasmuch as it is “an orderly arrangement of parts or 
elements into a whole” or “an organized body of truth.” The one 
author of Christian theology is the one, true, and living God, who 
proclaims the divine truth in the Old as well as in the New Testa¬ 
ment, by Moses no less than by Paul, so that Holy Scripture sets 
forth, not the subjective views of Moses, or Isaiah, or Peter, or 
Paul, or John, etc., but the sacred doctrine of God Himself. 
Scripture doctrine is everywhere and in the same degree divine 
doctrine (doctrina divina). 

Again, in this divine doctrine, clearly and infallibly stated in 
Holy Scripture, the article of justification by grace, through faith 
in Christ, is the central teaching, to which the other articles of 
faith either lead up (articuli antecedentes) or point back (articuii 
consequentes). 1 Cor. 2, 2: “I determined not to know anything 
among you save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” Acts 20, 27: 



80 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


“I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.” 
In all of St. Paul’s preaching, which, according to his own testi¬ 
mony, embraced “all the counsel of God” unto salvation, the doc¬ 
trine of Christ Crucified for the sins of the world was basic and 
pivotal. 

In view of this close connection of the various Christian doc¬ 
trines with its central teaching and with one another, a connection 
which is so intimate that errors in one point must inevitably pro¬ 
duce errors also in the others, Christian theology may certainly be 
called a system. And we apply the term especially to point out 
not only the absolute unity of the whole body of truth, but also 
the perfect coherency of its elemental parts. Luther is right in 
saying: “In philosophy a small error in the beginning is a very 
serious error in the end. So also in theology a slight error will 
destroy the whole doctrine. For the doctrine is like a mathematical 
point; it cannot be divided, that is, it cannot brook either sub¬ 
traction or addition. Hence the doctrine must be one certain, 
perpetual, and round golden ring, in which there is no break. 
If even the least break occurs, the ring is no longer perfect.” 
(St. L., IX, 644 f.) Whoever, for instance, errs with respect to the 
Holy Trinity must err also with regard to the deity of Christ; 
or whoever teaches synergism cannot teach in its unadulterated 
form the doctrine of divine grace. Just because Christian theology 
is a system, it does not permit any perversion or denial of a single 
one of its doctrines; for every perversion of its constituent parts 
must necessarily destroy the entire system. 

Nevertheless Christian theology may not be called a system 
in the sense in which human systems of knowledge are so called. 
In science and philosophy a system is “an orderly collection of 
logically related principles and facts, arranged so as to express the 
whole range of truth in any department.” In that sense sacred 
theology is not a system; for it is not constructed by human reason 
on the basis of a given fundamental principle. Its author is not 
man, but God. In it reason has only an instrumental, not a magis¬ 
terial, function (mus instrumentalis, non usus magisterialis ). Nor 
does it deduce and demonstrate its truths from a given premise or 
principle, but it merely inculcates the truths set forth in Holy 
Scripture, with the proper emphasis on the cardinal doctrine of 
justification by grace. In other words, the analysis and synthesis 
which the theologian applies never go beyond the Word of God. 
Wherever Holy Scripture contains lacunae, or omissions, the system 
of the Christian theologian likewise contains lacunae, or omissions. 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


81 


The true theologian teaches only what Holy Scripture teaches, not 
more and not less. His system is only a declaration and statement 
of Scriptural doctrine. 

This is a point of the greatest importance, and only as the 
theologian continually and conscientiously observes it, will he be 
kept from the fatal mistake of adding to the Word of God human 
opinions and doctrines, a perversion of Christian doctrine against 
which Holy Scripture most earnestly warns. Let the Christian 
theologian therefore bear in mind the basic truth that in the system 
of Christian doctrine, while it is complete so far as its scope is 
concerned, that is, so far as it pertains to the salvation of sinners, 
we may nevertheless speak of “missing links”; that is, there remain 
questions which Scripture does not answer. For example, Holy 
Scripture sets forth most emphatically the sola gratia and the 
universalis gratia; that is to say, sinners are saved solely by grace, 
and divine grace desires the salvation of all sinners. This being 
true, the question arises: “Why, then, are not all men saved ?” 
The proposed explanation that the difference lies in men (aliquid 
discrimen in homine), since some are better than others, is most 
strenuously denied by God’s Word, which declares that all men by 
nature are in the same guilt (in eadem culpa). Eom. 3, 22—24: 
“For there is no difference; for all have sinned and come short of 
the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace, through the 
redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” 

With the same emphasis Holy Scripture denies also the Cal- 
vinistic explanation that God has eternally predetermined some to 
damnation. Hence it is clear that Holy Scripture does not answer 
the question Cur alii, alii non? This does not mean that Holy 
Scripture does not give us any information with regard to the 
question of salvation and damnation. It tells us clearly that, if 
sinners are saved, they are saved solely by grace and that, if they 
are lost, they are lost through their own fault. Nevertheless, when 
we compare two individual sinners, as David and Saul, or Peter 
and Judas, and ask, “Why was the one saved and the other not?” 
(Cur alii prae aliisf), this question remains unanswered. Nor is 
it proper for the Christian theologian to endeavor to answer the 
question; for in that case he must draw on human reason to decide 
what is properly a matter of divine revelation. Attempts to solve 
the particular point in question have resulted either in Calvinism, 
the denial of universal grace, or in synergism, the denial of grace 
alone. But the Christian theologian must affirm both the univer- 

CHRISTIAX DOGMATICS. 6 



82 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


salis gratia and the sola gratia. In the system of Christian doc¬ 
trine therefore lacunae, or doctrinal “missing links,” must be ad¬ 
mitted, as St. Paul himself declares when he writes: “We know in 
part, and we prophesy in part,” 1 Cor. 13, 9. The Christian theo¬ 
logian must know and teach in part only, that is, only as the divine 
truths which he is to inculcate are clearly set forth in Holy 
Scripture. In connection with this point we may note also the 
following truths: — 

a. Holy Scripture, in all its parts, is the divinely inspired, 
infallible Word of God, in which He teaches man the only way to 
salvation. To this way of salvation, which is both complete and 
perfect, the Christian theologian must add nothing, neither must 
he take away from it even the least particle, John 10, 35; 2 Tim. 
3,16; 2 Pet. 1, 21; John 8, 31. 32; Rev. 22,18—20. Any change 
or perversion of the divine Word is a scandal, which offends God 
and ultimately renders impossible the salvation of sinners, which 
God has purposed by giving His Word to men. 

b. Modern rationalistic theology, which denies the funda¬ 
mentals of the Christian doctrine for the very reason that it rejects 
the divinely inspired Word of God as the only source and norm of 
faith, seeks to construct its own unified system of teachings (ein 
einheitliches Oanzes) on the basis of “Christian consciousness,” 
“Christian experience,” “regenerate reason,” etc. In other words, 
it substitutes for the true principium cognoscendi a false standard 
of doctrine and dethrones Holy Scripture from its exalted eminence 
of being the only authority in religion. To the modern rational¬ 
istic theologian Holy Scripture is only an “authentic record” of 
divine revelation, in which divine and human elements are incon¬ 
gruously blended and from which his “enlightened mind” must 
glean the truths that are to constitute his “system of theology.” 
Or to state it in different terms, modern rationalistic theology re¬ 
fuses to identify the Word of God with Holy Scripture; for it 
regards Holy Scripture as only containing the Word of God. These 
theologians hold that the subjective judgment of the individual 
must decide just what is the Word of God, or divine truth, in Holy 
Scripture. This procedure must be condemned as a crimen laesae 
maiesiatis against the divine Lord, as a revolt against His divinely 
established authority, and as a downright rejection of His holy 
Word, which must result in unspeakable confusion and perversion. 
This is evident from the fact that the pantheistic system of 
Schleiermacher and the modernistic system of Ritschl, both of 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


83 


which are built up on the subjective authority of human reason, 
equally reject the Gospel of Christ and inculcate doctrines in direct 
opposition to it. The appeal of rationalistic theologians to “Chris¬ 
tian consciousness,” “Christian experience,” and the like, as foun¬ 
dations of systems of faith are a mere pretense to conceal their 
unholy endeavor of casting aside Holy Scripture and its divine 
doctrines and teaching their own word. 

c. The Christian theologian, in performing his functions as 
a teacher of the Church, must always remember that all the state¬ 
ments of Holy Scripture are infallible truths, which nothing can 
overthrow, and that it is therefore his sacred duty to present these 
truths just as they are set forth in Holy Scripture, without addi¬ 
tion or subtraction. Systems of philosophy or of science are con¬ 
structed by human reasoning on the basis of facts or theories gath¬ 
ered by the originator himself; but sacred theology is a science 
which God Himself, its divine Author, presents to men complete 
and perfect and altogether adequate for its divinely designed 
purpose. Hence men are to preach the Word of God and not to 
philosophize about it; they are to be preachers, not demonstrators, 
of the truth. The Christian theologian has completely accom¬ 
plished his task if he has set forth clearly and unmistakably the 
sacred truths taught by God in Holy Scripture. Nothing more is 
asked of him, but also nothing less. 

d. The Christian theologian’s work of systematizing therefore 
consists only in presenting the several divine truths given in Holy 
Scripture under their proper heads. These truths are derived 
from the proof-passages (sedes doctrinae), that is, from the clear 
and unmistakable passages in which the particular doctrines are 
set forth, and not from the “entirety of Scripture” or the “scope 
of Scripture” (vom Schriftganzen). The purpose of this system¬ 
atizing is to present “all the counsel of God,” or to teach each and 
every doctrine which God’s Word teaches. If the theologian goes 
beyond this, if he presents his own personal views as the teaching 
of God’s Word, he is no longer a Christian theologian, but a false 
prophet. 

e. The charge so frequently made that Luther himself devel¬ 
oped his doctrines, in particular the doctrine of justification by 
grace, is refuted by his own statements on this point. According 
to his own confession the great Keformer never operated with “the 
scope of Scripture,” but with Scripture-passages so clear and un¬ 
mistakable that upon these his doctrines rested as upon an im- 



84 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


pregnable rock. It is for this reason that Luther's theology is so 
thoroughly Scriptural. He constructed no system of doctrine out¬ 
side and beyond the written Word of God, but received and taught 
in simple faith the sacred truths positively set forth in the sedes 
doctrinae of Holy Scripture. He was a systematician whose whole 
system of doctrine was rooted in, and governed by, God’s Word. 
He writes: “It is certain that whosoever does not rightly believe 
or desire one single article . . . certainly does not believe any at all 
with true earnestness and right faith. And whosoever is so pre¬ 
sumptuous as to deny God or call Him a liar in one word [of Scrip¬ 
ture], and does this deliberately, . . . will also deny God in all His 
words and in all of them call Him a liar. Therefore it is necessary 
to believe all and everything truly and fully or else believe nothing. 
The Holy Spirit does not allow Himself to be separated or divided, 
so that He should teach or have us believe one doctrine as true and 
another as false.” (St. L., XX, 1781.) 

f. In conclusion it may be said that the rationalistic systems 
of theology, which pride themselves so smugly on their inner 
harmony and perfection, are after all decidedly imperfect and in¬ 
complete. They cannot be otherwise, since human reason is unable 
to answer in a satisfactory manner the paramount questions which 
properly belong to the sphere of divine revelation. In other words, 
unless God answers for us the questions pertaining to the great 
verities of spiritual knowledge, they never will be answered. 
Consequently, wherever the Holy Spirit, the infallible Revealer of 
divine truth, saw fit to be silent with respect to doctrinal issues, 
human reason must likewise be silent. Theologians who propose 
to construct complete systems of truth on the basis of their reason 
or their subjective theology perpetrate a piece of fraud which is 
unpardonable and which leads to downright apostasy from the 
Word of God, to uncertainty in spiritual matters, and to endless 
confusion and contradiction. For all who err from Scripture err 
from truth in general; and the systems of doctrine that are not 
Scriptural are likewise not rational. For this the history of dogma 
furnishes abundant proof. 

20. THEOLOGICAL METHODS. 

In the presentation of the dogmatic material Lutheran divines 
have employed, in the main, two methods, the synthetic and the 
analytic. The synthetic method proceeds from cause to effect, while 
the analytic method pursues the opposite course, from effect to 
cause. Synthetically arranged, the dogmatic grouping presents, 



NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


86 


first, God as the Cause and Principle of all things created; next, 
the means by which sinful and apostate mankind is brought back 
to communion with God; and lastly, the glorious salvation itself to 
which the believer attains. Analytically, the dogmatic material 
would be grouped as follows: Salvation, as the final objective of 
man; next, the means by which salvation is attained; and lastly, 
God as the divine Giver and Author of salvation. 

The analytical method has been preferred by the later theo¬ 
logians of the Lutheran Church for the avowed reason that the¬ 
ology, being a practical subject, should first present man’s final goal 
as the vital idea in Christian doctrine. After all, however, the 
grouping of the doctrinal material is of little consequence as long 
as Holy Scripture is recognized as the only source and standard 
of faith, from which alone the theologian must draw his teachings. 
If the doctrine is taken from any other source than Holy Scrip¬ 
ture, either method is equally unsatisfactory; if the theologian 
remains loyal to God’s Word, both methods may be employed with 
equal success. In the final analysis, not the method of presenting 
the theological material, but faithfulness to Scripture, is the prime 
requisite of a good dogmatic treatise. 

The synthetic method was commonly used within the Lutheran 
Church by the early dogmaticians, such as Melanchthon, Chemnitz, 
Hutter, Gerhard. The analytic method was followed by Dann- 
hauer, Koenig, Calov, Quenstedt, Baier, Hollaz, and others. Occa¬ 
sionally we find a combination of the two methods. The time is 
past when a dogmatic treatise is judged by its method, though 
a modified form of the synthetic method perhaps is now given the 
preference. But what the Christian Church must demand of all 
dogmatic treatises or books is a clear, thorough, and practical 
presentation of the Scriptural truths. The only theology which 
deserves a place in Christ’s Church is the sacred theology which 
God Himself has given in Holy Scripture. From this surpassing 
treasure of divine truth the Christian theologian dare not deviate 
in the slightest; if he does, he is disloyal to the charge entrusted 
to him. In his system of theology the two distinctive principles of 
the Christian faith, the sola Scriptura and the sola gratia, must 
stand preeminent; otherwise his entire theology becomes rational¬ 
istic, paganistic, and destructive, a disgrace to the name of Christ 
and a menace to His Church. Quod non est Mblicum , non est the- 
ologicum. All dogma that is not founded upon this axiom does 
not deserve the name of Christian theology.

NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


21. THE ACQUISITION OF THE THEOLOGICAL HABITUDE. 

Our Lutheran dogmaticians have rightly emphasized the great 
truth that “the theologian is not born, but made.” (Theologus non 
nascitur, sed fit.) By this axiom they wished to say that no man 
by nature is a theologian nor can become a theologian by his own 
reason or strength. Theology is a God-given habitude. ( Theologia 
est habitus practicus dedodozos.) Hence the Holy Spirit Himself 
must make a person a theologian. How the Holy Spirit accom¬ 
plishes this is excellently described by Luther in the famous dic¬ 
tum: Oratio, meditatio, tentatio faciunt theologum. This is the 
best description of theological methodology which has ever been 
attempted; for it names, briefly, yet fully, all the elements that 
cooperate in the making of a true theologian. 

It recognizes first of all the necessity of prayer. With regard 
to prayer as a means by which to acquire the theological habitude, 
Luther writes: “For this reason you should despair of your wisdom 
and reason; for with these you will acquire nothing, but by your 
arrogance cast yourself and others into the pit of hell, as did 
Lucifer. Kneel down in your chamber and ask God in true 
humility and seriousness to grant you His Holy Spirit through 
His beloved Son in order that He may enlighten you, guide you, 
and grant you a true wisdom.” (St. L., XIV, 434 ff.) That sin¬ 
cere and constant prayer is an indispensable factor in the acquisi¬ 
tion of the theological habitude is attested not only by all true 
theologians who have served the Christian Church in the spirit of 
its divine Lord, but also by Holy Scripture itself. John 15, 7. 8: 
“If ye abide in Me and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what 
ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is My Father glori¬ 
fied that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples”; 16,24: 
“Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” Jas. 1, 5: 
“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all 
men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” 

The second requisite in Luther’s methodology is meditation , 
or study. Of this Luther writes: “In the second place, you should 
meditate, and not only in your heart, but also outwardly, the oral 
Word and the express words that are written in the Book, which 
you must always consider and reconsider and read and read over 
with diligent attention and reflection to see what the Holy Ghost 
means thereby. And take care that you do not become weary of it, 
thinking that you have read it sufficiently if you have read, heard, 
or said it once or twice and understand it perfectly. For in this

87 


way no great theologian is made, but they [who do not study] are 
like immature fruit, which falls down before it is half ripe. For 
this reason you see in this psalm [Ps. 119] that David is always 
boasting that he would speak, meditate, declare, sing, hear, read, 
day and night and forever, yet nothing else than alone the Word 
and the commandments of God. For God does not purpose to 
give you His Spirit without the external Word. Be guided by that. 
For He did not command in vain to write, preach, read, hear, sing, 
and declare His external Word.” By meditation, Luther, then, 
understands the constant study of Holy Scripture as the pure and 
infallible Word of God, by which the Holy Ghost not only converts 
and sanctifies sinners, but also renders the theologian capable of 
doing the work of a truly Christian teacher in the fear of God, in 
other words, by which He bestows the theological habitude. It is 
clear that such constant study of God’s Word is commanded also 
in Holy Scripture. 1 Tim. 4,13 : “Till I come, give attendance to 
reading”; v. 15 : “Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly 
to them, that thy profiting may appear to all”; 6, 20: “0 Timothy, 
keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and 
vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called.” 

Concerning temptation as a means by which the Holy Spirit 
creates or enhances the theological habitude, Luther writes: “In 
the third place, there is tentatio, that is, trial. That is the true 
touchstone, which teaches you not only to know and understand, 
but also to experience, how true, sincere, sweet, lovely, powerful, 
comforting, the Word of God is, so that it is the wisdom above all 
wisdom. Thus you see how David, in the psalm just mentioned, 
complains about all manner of enemies, wicked princes and tyrants, 
false prophets and factions, which he must endure because he always 
meditates, that is, deals with God’s Word in every possible way, 
as stated. For as soon as the Word of God bears fruit through you, 
the devil will trouble you, make you a real teacher, and teach you 
through tribulation to seek and to love the Word of God. For 
I myself — if I am permitted to voice my humble opinion — must 
thank my papists very much for so buffeting, distressing, and terri¬ 
fying me by the devil’s fury that they made me a fairly good 
theologian, which otherwise I should never have become.” 

As Luther here says, his whole theology grew out of his trials 
and troubles, which forced him to seek strength and comfort in 
Holy Scripture. And Luther experienced trials both from within 
and from without. First he was troubled by tentationes within his 



88 


NATURE AND CONCEPT OF THEOLOGY. 


heart. Before he became a Christian theologian, he was plagued 
with the agony of a troubled conscience, produced by his insistence 
on work-righteousness as the means of obtaining pardon. From 
this state of dread and anguish he was at last rescued by the knowl¬ 
edge and understanding of the blessed Gospel, from which he in¬ 
deed learned how “true, sincere, sweet, lovely, and powerful the 
Word of God is.” Afterwards, when he began to proclaim the 
Gospel of Christ in its purity and truth, trials came to him from 
without. He was stigmatized as a heretic and schismatic, not only 
by the Romanists, but also by the enthusiasts of his time, so that 
again he was forced “to seek and love the Word”; and thuB he 
became so established in, and convinced of, the divine truth that 
he could say: “Here I stand, I cannot do otherwise.” Trials, or 
tentationes , therefore, made Luther a “fairly good theologian,” 
because they compelled him to anchor his hope only in the Word 
of God. And so every Christian who aspires to become a true 
theologian must seek, study, and cling to. Holy Scripture until he 
regards it as the “wisdom above all wisdom.” 

Luther concludes his remarks on his famous axiom with the 
words: “Then [namely, if you follow the rule of David exhibited 
in Ps. 119] you will find how shallow and unworthy will appear to 
you the writings of the Fathers, and you will contemn not only 
the books of the opponents, but also be ever less pleased with your 
own writing and teaching. If you have arrived at this stage, you 
may surely hope that you have just begun to be a real theologian, 
one who is able to teach not only the young and unlearned, but 
also the advanced and well-instructed Christians. For Christ’s 
Church includes all manner of Christians — young, old, weak, sick, 
healthy, strong, aggressive, indolent, simple, wise, etc. But if you 
consider yourself learned and imagine that you have attained the 
goal and feel proud of your booklets, teaching and writing, as 
though you had done marvelously and preached wondrously, and 
if you are much pleased because people praise you before others and 
you must be praised or otherwise you are disappointed and feel 
like giving up, — if you are minded like that, my friend, just grab 
yourself by the ears, and if you grab rightly, you will find a fine 
pair of big, long, rough donkey ears. Then go to a little more 
expense and adorn yourself with golden bells, so that, wherever 
you go, people can hear you, admiringly point at you with their 
fingers, and say, *Lo and behold, there is that wonderful man who 
can write such excellent books and preach so remarkably!’ Then

certainly you will be blessed, yes, more than blessed, in the kingdom 
of heaven — indeed, in that kingdom in which the fire of hell has 
been prepared for the devil and his angels! In fine, let us seek 
honor and be haughty wherever we may. In this Book, God’s glory 
alone is set forth, and it says: 'Dens superb is resistit, humilibus 
autem dat gratiam. . . . Cui est gloria in secula seculorum. 
Amen " 

Luther’s emphasis upon true humility as a requisite of a true 
theologian is certainly in place, since the Holy Spirit with His 
sanctifying and sustaining gifts is present only in a contrite, 
humble heart. To the humble alone God gives the grace of true 
theology.

THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 

(De Scriptura Sacra.) 


1. HOLY SCRIPTURE THE ONLY SOURCE AND NORM 

OF FAITH. 

The Christian Church is much older than Holy Scripture, 
that is, it existed long before God gave His written Word to men; 
for until the time of Moses God called and preserved His Church 
by oral teaching (viva voce). The Christian Church began imme¬ 
diately after the Fall, when God proclaimed to fallen mankind 
salvation through faith in the Seed of the Woman, who was to 
destroy the works of the devil; and Adam and Eve penitently 
believed the Protevangelium (Gen. 3,15). This method of orally 
promulgating His Word was retained by God until the time when 
He called Israel out of Egypt and made it His chosen people, or 
His Church, Gen. 4, 26; 13, 4; 20, 4; Acts 10, 43; Ex. 17, 14; 
24, 4. 7; etc. 

However, after God had commanded His prophets to put His 
Word in writing, His Church was rigidly bound to the written 
Word, and it was not permitted either to add to the Scriptures or 
to take anything away from them, Deut. 4, 2; 12, 32; Josh. 1, 7; 
.23, 6. For the Church of the Old Testament the prophetic Scrip¬ 
tures constituted a fixed canon, to which only God Himself could 
make additions, John 5, 39 ; Luke 16, 29. In the time of the New 
Testament, God added to the existing and acknowledged Scrip¬ 
tures of the prophets the holy writings of the apostles, to form, 
together with the Scriptures of the Old Testament, the inerrant 
foundation upon which His Church is built, Eph. 2, 20; 1 Pet. 
1 , 10 — 12 . 

With the revelations of Christ and His holy apostles the Scrip¬ 
tural canon is now complete, and the Christian Church is to look 
for no more revelations from God, John 17, 20; Eph. 2, 20; Heb. 
1, 1—3. Luther writes very aptly: “That we may do: If we, too, 
are holy and have the Holy Spirit, we may boast of being cate¬ 
chumens and pupils of the prophets, inasmuch as we repeat and 
preach what we have heard and learned from the prophets and 
apostles and are sure that the prophets have taught it. In the Old 
Testament those are called ‘the children of the prophets’ who did 
not teach anything of their own or anything new, as did the 
prophets, but taught what they had received from the prophets.” 
(St. L., Ill, 1890.) 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


91 


If the question is asked where the New Testament Church may 
unerringly find the word of the apostles, they themselves point us 
to their holy writings and tell us that what they proclaimed orally 
is the same as that which they recorded in their sacred Scriptures, 
1 John 1,3.4 ; 2 Thess. 2,15. Though the apostles did not put 
into writing everything that they taught orally, nevertheless every¬ 
thing that is required for salvation is found in abundance in their 
writings, since they record with great diligence God’s counsel of 
salvation through faith in Christ Jesus, John 21, 25; Phil. 3,1. 
In addition, the holy apostles insisted upon their written word as 
the only source and norm of faith against all errorists of their time, 
demanding that all who regarded themselves as prophets must fol¬ 
low the Lord’s commands as these are laid down in their writings, 
1 Cor. 14, 37. 38; 2 Thess. 2, 2. St. Paul especially put his own 
signature to his epistles in order that these might be distinguished 
from spurious apostolic epistles, 2 Thess. 3,17. Both the prophets 
and the apostles thus attest that Holy Scripture, or the written 
Word of God, is the only source and norm of faith and life, or the 
true principium cognoscendi (Schriftprinzip ). 

This fundamental truth has been denied in various ways. The 
principle of Scripture, or the fact that Holy Scripture is the only 
source and norm of faith, has been abrogated by the substitution of 
something else for God’s Word. 

a. Human reason has been substituted for Scripture. By 
human reason we mean everything that man knows of God and 
divine things outside of Holy Scripture, or simply man’s natural 
knowledge of God. This natural knowledge of God, however, can¬ 
not be the source of man’s faith, since it is limited to the Law and 
its demands, Rom. 1, 20. 21. 32; 2,15, and does not include the 
precious Gospel of Christ, or the message of reconciliation through 
the vicarious satisfaction of the incarnate Son of God, by which 
alone sinners can be saved, 1 Cor. 2, 6 ff.; Rom. 1,16. Any one 
who makes human reason the norm of faith commits the logical 
fallacy of perd^aatg elg &XXo ybog and excludes himself from the 
Christian Church, since he substitutes for divine truth his own 
fallible wisdom, which rejects God’s free salvation offered in the 
Gospel as foolishness, 1 Cor. 1, 21—25. The Christian Church 
therefore repudiates all forms of rationalism, Unitarianism, and 
Modernism, which regard human reason, or human science, as the 
source of faith, and condemns its proponents as being outside the 
pale of the Church (extra ecclesiam). 



92 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


By human reason, however, we denote also the means by which 
man perceives and thinks. This is the so-called ministerial use of 
reason (usus rationis ministerialist organicus) and is quite distinct 
from its magisterial use (usus rationis magisterialis). Reason in 
this sense has a legitimate and necessary place in theology, since 
the Holy Spirit implants and preserves saving faith through the 
Word of God which is received into the human mind, Rom. 10, 
14.17; John 5,39; Matt. 24,15; Luke 2,19. To the ministerial 
use of reason belongs also the study of the languages in which Holy 
Scripture was originally written, and in particular that of logic 
and grammar, because the Holy Spirit, in giving to man God’s 
Word, was pleased to accommodate Himself to the laws of human 
thought and speech. Luther makes the remark that God is incar¬ 
nate in Holy Scripture (Scriptura Sacra est Deus incamatus). 
In the same sense our Lutheran dogmaticians say that “theology 
must be grammatical” (theologia debet esse grammatica), which 
means that, if the theologian desires to understand Scripture, he 
must observe the fixed laws by which human speech and expression 
is governed. Luther urged this truth so vigorously as to maintain 
that any one who errs in grammar cannot but err also in his 
theology. 

By distinguishing between the ministerial and the magisterial 
use of reason, our Lutheran dogmaticians also decided the question 
whether sacred theology and human reason, or Christian truth and 
human philosophy, really contradict each other. Their contention 
was that, since truth is always the same, such a contradiction could 
occur only if perverted reason presumed to be an arbiter in matters 
lying beyond its specific domain. With regard to the articles of 
faith they averred that these are not contrary to reason, but only 
above reason and that, if seemingly they did contradict reason, 
they were contrary only to corrupt reason or to the perversion of 
reason in the interest of falsehood and enmity against God. 

However, the Christian theologian must expect the warfare 
between theology and perverted reason, or science falsely so called, 
to continue because ever since the Fall man by nature has been 
at enmity with God, Rom. 8, 7, and regards the very essence of the 
Christian religion, or the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as foolishness, 
1 Cor. 2,14. In consequence of his innate hatred against God and 
divine things, which always reveals itself in proud and arrogant 
rejection of His Word, natural man will never cease to oppose 
divine truth on the ground of his own supposed knowledge, so that 
unbelieving philosophers and atheistic scientists will always charge 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


93 


Scripture with teaching falsehood (atheistic evolution). Gerhard 
is quite right when he says (II, 371): “We must distinguish 
between reason before and after the Fall. The former, as such, 
was never opposed to divine revelation; the latter has frequently 
been thus opposed through the influence of corruption.” 

b. The enlightened reason, which is also known as “Christian 
consciousness,” “Christian experience,” “Christian conviction,” 
“Christian assurance,” etc., has been substituted for the Word 
of God. It is true, every believer in Christ has an enlightened 
mind, but as far as he is a Christian, he never insists upon his 
enlightened reason as a source or norm of faith, since he owes his 
illumination entirely to the living power of the Word of God, 
Rom. 1,16; and he knows that his reason will at once sink back 
into spiritual ignorance as soon as he departs from Christ’s en¬ 
lightening Gospel. Hence all who set up the enlightened mind 
of the Christian as a principium cognoscendi apart from Scripture 
deceive themselves, since their very desire to enthrone their en¬ 
lightened reason as a judge of faith proceeds from their unenlight¬ 
ened reason, or their proud carnal mind, 1 Tim. 6, 3—5. Reason, 
inasmuch as it is illuminated by the Holy Ghost through the Word, 
never presumes to judge Scripture, but faithfully adheres to God’s 
Word in all things and glories in its sacred teachings, John 8, 
31. 32; 2 Cor. 10, 4. 5; 1 Cor. 1,18. 24. Luther writes very cor¬ 
rectly: “The Holy Spirit never operates without or before the 
Word, but He comes with and through the Word and never goes 
beyond the Word.” (St. L., XI, 1073.) 

c. The general scope of Scripture {"das Schriftganze “the 
whole of Scripture”). The advocates of this theory claim that 
the Christian articles of faith must not be drawn from Scripture- 
passages treating of the individual doctrines (sedes doctrinae, dicta 
probantia), but from the general scope or tenor of the Bible, which 
Schleiermacher, who first propounded this false view, called "das 
Schriftganze” or the “whole of Scripture.” Modern rationalizing 
theologians have readily assented to Schleiermacher’s proposition; 
but we must reject it as utterly unadoptable, since the whole of 
a thing necessarily involves all its component parts, and as abso¬ 
lutely unscriptural, since Christ and His apostles invariably refuted 
error by referring to distinct Scripture-passages, Matt. 4, 4. 7.10; 
Rom. 1,17; 1 Cor. 10, 7—10; Gal. 4, 22 f. Schleiermacher’s con¬ 
tention that “it is a most precarious procedure to quote Scripture- 
passages in a dogmatic treatise and, besides, in itself quite inad- 



94 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


equate” ( Glaubenslehre, I, § 30) was only a pretext to justify 
his unscriptural method of deriving the theological truths from his 
reason, or the “pious self-consciousness.” Scripture declares of 
every theologian who repudiates the sacred doctrines set forth in 
God’s Word: “If any man consent not to wholesome words, even 
the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, he is proud, knowing nothing, 
but doting about questions and strifes of words,” 1 Tim. 6, 3. 4. 

d. The Church, in particular the decisions of church councils , 
synods, Popes, etc., is substituted for Scripture by many. Accord¬ 
ing to Holy Scripture, however, the Christian Church has no 
authority whatever to teach any doctrine besides and beyond the 
Word of its divine Master Jesus Christ, laid down in the writings 
of His prophets and apostles, Matt. 23, 8.10; 28, 20; John 17, 20; 
Eph. 2, 20; 1 Pet. 1, 10—12. Hence the Church cannot be re¬ 
garded as a judge of faith, but according to the will of its Lord 
it is to function till the end of time merely as a herald, or mes¬ 
senger, of God’s Word, John 8, 31. 32. Whenever a Church puts 
forth doctrines of its own fabrication, it disowns the principle of 
Scripture and falls under the condemnation of Christ: “In vain 
they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of 
men,” Matt. 15, 9. The “consensus of the Church” (consensus 
ecclesiae) is not what Christian teachers have opined on this or 
that point of doctrine, but what they have declared as divine truth 
on the basis of Scripture, that is to say, in agreement with the 
witness of the holy prophets and apostles. According to Holy 
Scripture all those who reject the teachings of God’s Word are 
antichrists, 1 John 2, 22, among whom the most perverse is the 
great Antichrist, “who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that 
is called God or that is worshiped, so that he as God sitteth in the 
temple of God, showing himself that he is God,” 2 Thess. 2, 3. 4. 
The declaration of papal infallibility (1870) must be regarded as 
intolerable blasphemy and antichristian rebellion against God. In 
vain do papistic theologians quote Matt. 16,18 as a proof that the 
Church, in particular the Pope, cannot err; for Christ promises 
to His Church His sustaining presence only under the condition 
that it faithfully teaches “unto the end of the world” “all things 
whatsoever I have commanded you,” Matt. 28, 20. As long as the 
Church adheres to the Word of Christ, it cannot err; but as soon 
as it departs from the divine Word, it cannot but err, since in 
that case it has no other source to draw from than proud, per¬ 
verted reason. 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 9& 

With respect to the witness of the Christian Church two ex¬ 
tremes must be avoided; on the one hand, it must not be under¬ 
estimated or rejected as worthless; on the other hand, it must 
not be overestimated, as if the testimony of the Church were in 
itself a principium cognoscendi. The Formula of Concord states 
the matter very correctly: “We believe, teach, and confess that 
the sole rule and standard according to which all dogmas together 
with all teachers should be estimated and judged are the prophetic 
and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and of the New Testament 
alone. . . . Other writings, however, of ancient or modern teachers, 
whatever name they bear, must not be regarded as equal to the 
Holy Scriptures, but all of them together be subjected to them 
and should not be received otherwise or further than as witnesses, 
in what manner after the time of the apostles and at what places 
this [pure] doctrine of the prophets and apostles was preserved.” - 
(Epitome, Triglot, p. 777. Cf. the distinction between norma 
normans, sc.. Scripture, and the norma normata, sc., the Confes¬ 
sions of the Church.) With regard to the so-called “consensus of 
the fathers” ( consensus patrum, i. e., the agreement of the Church 
Fathers) Quenstedt shows that this does not exist; for many writ¬ 
ings of the teachers of the ancient Church have been lost, and “the 
consensus of a few fathers cannot be accepted as the consensus of 
the whole Church.” (Cf. the definition of the consensus patrum by 
Yincentius of Lerinum: " Quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab om¬ 
nibus creditum est," which is practically worthless.) 

e. Private revelations (revelationes immediatae, revelationes 
novae). Private revelations are supposedly new doctrines which. 
God gives to individuals to explain, correct, and supplement Holy 
Scripture. Fanatics, asserting that they had received private reve¬ 
lations, arose even in the time of the apostles, 1 Cor. 14, 37; 
2 Thess. 2, 2; and in their wake there followed in the second and 
fourth centuries the Montanists and Donatists. At the time of Lu¬ 
ther's Reformation, the “heavenly prophets,” the Anabaptists and 
Schwenkfeldians, rejected the “external Word” and in its place 
stressed the “inner word,” stigmatizing obedience to Scripture as 
“letter service” (Buchstabendienst); while in modern times the 
Christian Church must cope with the enthusiasm of such religious 
organizations as the Quakers, Swedenborgians, Irvingites, and 
others. In addition to these visionaries it must oppose also those 
who separate the operation of the Holy Ghost from the Word of 
Scripture and rely on private revelations as the norm of their 
faith, e. g.: — 



96 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY 8 CRIP TUBE. 


a. The Romanists, who ascribe to their Popes the charisma of 
infallible teaching outside and beyond Scripture. With regard to 
the Papacy, Luther writes in the Smalcald Articles: “The Papacy 
also is nothing but sheer enthusiasm, by which the Pope boasts 
that all rights exist in the shrine of his heart, and whatever he 
decides and commands with [in] his Church is spirit and right, 
even though it is above and contrary to Scripture and the spoken 
Word” (Part III, Art. VIII, 4.) 

b. The Calvinists, who teach that the saving work of the Holy 
Spirit occurs immediately, i. e., outside and apart from the Word. 
(Hodge: “Efficacious grace acts i mm ediately”) 

c. All modern rationalistic theologians, who deny that Holy 
Scripture is the inerrant Word of God and therefore propose to 
draw the Christian doctrine from their “pious self-consciousness,” 
their “Christian experience,” and the like, while they stigmatize 
loyalty to Scripture as “letter theology,” “intellectualism,” “Bib- 
licism,” etc. The result of enthusiasm in religion is always the 
same, no matter whether it is practised by papists, Calvinists, or 
modern rationalists, as Luther well points out in the Smalcald 
Articles, in which he writes: “Enthusiasm adheres in Adam and 
his children from the beginning (from the first fall) to the end 
of the world, (its poison) having been implanted and infused into 
them by the old dragon, and is the origin, power (life), and 
strength of all heresy, especially of that of the Papacy and Ma¬ 
homet.” (Part III, Art. "VIII, 9.) Luther says with regard to the 
pious pretenses of the enthusiasts: “They say these things only in 
order that they may lead us away from the Bible and make them¬ 
selves masters over us, so that we should believe their dream ser¬ 
mons.” (St. L., Y, 334 f.) 

The question of whether God deigns to reveal new doctrines 
outside, and apart from, the Bible is definitely decided in His 
Word, which binds all Christian believers to Holy Scripture as the 
sole source and norm of faith, John 17, 20; Eph. 2,20. In Christ 
Jesus, the Light and Savior of the world, all divine revelations 
culminate, the prophets in the Old Testament pointing forward to 
His coming and the apostles witnessing to His incarnation. Passion, 
resurrection, ascension, and session at the right hand of God. Since 
Christ’s prophetic and sacerdotal ministry has been accomplished 
(John 1,18), men require no further revelations for their salvation 
because every doctrine needed for both faith and life of the Chris¬ 
tian is amply supplied in the writings of the prophets and apostles, 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


97 


Rom. 16,17; 1 Tim. 6, 3ff.; Luke 16,29—31. Lutheran dogma- 
ticians have aptly remarked with reference to the “new revelations” 
of the enthusiasts: “Either they contain what Scripture already 
teaches, and in that case they are superfluous; or they propound 
teachings contrary to the Bible, and in that case they are injurious 
and must be rejected.” 

f. Historical investigation. Modernists, rejecting the histor¬ 
ical character of the New Testament, assert that they must go 
beyond Scripture to ascertain who the “historical Christ” really was 
and what He actually taught. To accomplish this purpose, they 
subject the records of the evangelists to a critical scrutiny in the 
light of comparative religion. The “historical Christ” whom they 
obtain by this procedure is divested of all supernatural properties 
and His doctrine of all supernatural elements. They make of Him 
a mere human teacher, whose doctrines are little more than an 
ethical code. In opposition to this preposterous method the true 
followers of Christ declare that the “historical revelation of the 
way of salvation is found only in the Bible” and that, as Luther 
correctly asserts, “we know nothing of Christ apart from and with¬ 
out His Word and much less of His teaching; for any ‘Christ’ who 
proposes an opinion outside the Word of Christ is the abominable 
devil, who applies to himself the holy name of Christ in order that 
he may thus sell to us his infernal venom.” (St. L., XVII, 2015.) 
The truth of this statement is proved by the actual results of the 
modern historico-critical school of theology; for while it violently 
rejects all the sacred truths set forth in the Bible, it is unable to 
construct a satisfactory system of doctrines which may comfort the 
sinner in his spiritual distress. Its influences have proved only 
destructive, never edifying or helpful. 

The reason for this is clear. After all, there can be only two 
sources of doctrine: Scripture and human reason. Any one who 
repudiates Holy Scripture as the true principium cognoscendi is 
obliged to draw his doctrine from his perverted mind or carnal 
heart, which at best retains only an imperfect knowledge of the 
divine Law originally inscribed in the human consciousness, so that 
natural man, knowing nothing at all of the true God and His 
glorious salvation through faith in Christ, is compelled to hold*the 
opinio legis, or salvation by good works, to be the supreme religious 
precept. Ultimately every rejection of God’s Word terminates in 
agnosticism or atheism. He who is without the divine Word is 
eo ipso also without God and without hope, Eph. 2,12.

THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


2. HOLY SCRIPTURE THE WORD OF GOD. 

In contradistinction to all other books in the world Holy Scrip¬ 
ture is the Word of God. As the writings of Plato are the word 
of Plato and those of Cicero are the word of Cicero, just so the 
Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, which the prophets 
and apostles wrote by divine inspiration, are throughout, from be¬ 
ginning to end, the words of God Himself. This is not a “dog¬ 
matic construction,” as rationalistic theologians have contended, 
but it is God’s own testimony, given in Scripture. Hence Chris¬ 
tian believers affirm not merely that the Bible contains God’s Word, 
but that it is God’s Word, that is to say, “Holy Scripture and the 
Word of God are interchangeable terms.” 

Holy Scripture is therefore a unique book; for it is neither 
a human nor a divine-human record of “revealed salvation facts,” 
but God’s own inspired and inerrant Word. The books of Chris¬ 
tian authors contain God’s Word as far as these pious writers have 
drawn from the Bible what they have written. But Scripture does 
not belong to this class of writings, but is in a class by itself. That 
was Luther’s attitude toward the Holy Bible, and it is that of every 
true Christian believer, who readily subscribes to what Luther 
writes on this point: “You must deal with Scripture in such a way 
that you think just as God Himself has spoken.” (St. L., Ill, 21.) 
The same truth Luther affirms when he says: “Holy Scripture did 
not grow upon the earth.” (St. L., VII, 2095.) 

Even sincere Christians at times forget this paramount truth 
because in Holy Scripture God speaks to us not only in simple, 
every-day terms, but also of very ordinary matters, things pertain¬ 
ing to the affairs of our earthly life. As a matter of fact, as Christ 
Himself during His sojourn on earth “was made in the likeness of 
man and found in fashion as a man,” Phil. 2, 7. 8, so that some 
believed Him to be “John the Baptist, Elias, Jeremias, or one of 
the prophets,” Matt. 16,14, so also God’s Word is set forth in Holy 
Scripture in the common speech of men and accommodated to our 
common earthly needs. Luther warns all believers: “I beg and 
warn most faithfully every pious Christian not to be offended at 
the simple speech and narrative which he will frequently meet 
with; let him not doubt, no matter how simple it may appear, that 
these are nothing but words, works, judgments, and narratives of 
the divine majesty, omnipotence, and wisdom. For this is the 
Scripture, which makes fools of all the wise and prudent and is 
open alone to the lowly and simple, as Christ Himself says in 
Matt. 11, 25. Therefore give up your pride and haughty spirit and

regard Scripture as the greatest and most precious sanctuary and 
the richest mine, which can never be fully exhausted, in order that 
you may find the divine wisdom, which God here presents so plainly 
and simply that He may quench our pride.” (St. L., XIV, 3f.) 
In spite of its simplicity we therefore identify Holy Scripture with 
God’s Word and declare that it is God’s Word from beginning 
to end and in every part. In this we follow God’s own directions 
given in Holy Scripture; for as we study that holy Book, we find: 

a. That in the New Testament the Scriptures of the Old Testa¬ 
ment are directly and absolutely quoted as Qod’s Word. We thus 
read. Matt. 1, 22. 23: "All this was done that it might be fulfilled 
which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet [Is. 7,14], saying, 
Behold, a virgin shall be with child,” etc. In Matt. 2,15 we read: 
“That it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the 
prophet [Hos. 11,1], saying, Out of Egypt have I called My Son.” 
In Acts 4, 25. 26 the words of Ps. 2,1. 2 are quoted as having been 
"spoken of God by the mouth of His servant David.” Acts 28, 25 f. 
quotes the words in Is. 6, 9.10 as words “which the Holy Ghost 
spake by Esaias the prophet.” In Heb. 3, 7 ff. we find a quotation 
from Ps. 95, 7 f., with the express remark, “as the Holy Ghost 
saith” Finally, in Rom. 3, 2 the Holy Scriptures, which were en¬ 
trusted to the Church of God of the Old Testament, are directly 
called “the words of God” (r a koyia zov deov). In fact, according 
to the unmistakable testimony of Christ the Old Testament Scrip¬ 
tures are so absolutely the Word of God that He says of them: 
“The Scripture cannot be broken,” John 10,35. The reference in 
this instance, sc., to Ps. 82, 6, is of great importance; for there 
magistrates are called “gods” (D'fi?**. §eoi). This appellation, ac¬ 
cording to our Savior, was not a mistake and could not be a mistake 
because “the Scripture cannot be broken.” From this passage 
therefore as well as from many others we learn that the Bible is 
verbally inspired, so that every word in Scripture is God’s own in¬ 
fallible Word. 

The series of passages in which the Old Testament Scriptures 
are called “God’s Word” is supported by another group of texts, 
in which the Scriptures are presented as so absolutely divine that 
all things foretold in them must be literally fulfilled, indeed, that 
all events that occur in this world are directed by God’s will, as 
revealed in Scripture. This takes Holy Scripture out of the class 
of human writings and places it in a class by itself, as God’s own 
holy Book. Thus in John 17,12 our Savior speaks of the apostasy 
of Judas and the loss of his soul and adds that this came about 



100 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


"that the Scripture might be fulfilled.” Christ’s own betrayal and 
capture in Gethsemane had to take place in order that “the Scrip¬ 
ture might be fulfilled,” Matt. 26, 54. Similarly we read in Luke 
24,44 if. that Christ had to suffer, die, and rise again "because all 
things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses 
and in the Prophets and in the Psalms [viz., in the entire Old 
Testament] concerning Me.” Olshausen is right in arguing that 
in the New Testament the quotations from the Old Testament are 
referred to not as proofs from human writings, but as incontro¬ 
vertible testimonies of their being divine writings. But the fact 
that the Old Testament Scriptures are God’s own Word was 
stated by Christ Himself when He gave the command: “Search 
the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they 
are they which testify of Me,” John 5, 39. 

b. The fact that the Scriptures of the New Testament occupy 
the same canonical position as those of the Old Testament and are 
therefore in the same manner and to the same degree the Word of 
God is proved by a number of clear passages. In 1 Pet. 1,10—12, 
the apostle first establishes the fact that the prophets of the Old 
Testament testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the 
glory that should follow through "the Spirit of Christ which was 
in them,” but then adds: "Which [the sufferings of Christ and 
His glory] are now reported unto you by them that have preached 
the Gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost (ir nvevjuaxi ayico, by the 
Holy Ghost) sent down from heaven.” According to this passage 
the apostles in the New Testament proclaimed the Gospel by the 
same Spirit of Christ which was in the prophets of the Old Testa¬ 
ment, so that their writings are the Word of God in the same sense 
and to the same degree as were those of the prophets. If the objec¬ 
tion is raised that this passage refers to the oral word of the 
apostles, we may quote passages in which the apostles place their 
written word on the same level with their spoken word and demand 
for it the same reverence and obedience, 1 John 1,3.4; 2 Thess. 
2,15; 1 Cor. 14, 37; 2 Cor. 13, 3. As in 1 Pet. 1,10—12, so also 
in Eph. 2, 20 the word of the apostles in the New Testament is ac¬ 
corded the same divine dignity and authority as the word of the 
prophets in the Old Testament; for both are declared to be the 
foundation upon which the Church is built. In addition to this, 
Christ states expressly that Christians would believe in Him and 
hence obtain salvation "through their [the apostles’] word,” John 
17, 20, which proves that their word is God’s own Word; for this 
alone is able to save souls, Rom. 1,16; Jas. 1, 21.

3. THE INSPIRATION OF THE BIBLE. 

Holy Scripture does not merely attest the fact that it is God’s 
Word: it also explains the peculiar manner in which God gave His 
Word to men. It clearly teaches that the Word of God was in¬ 
spired, or inbreathed into certain holy men, whom God called to 
be the official writers of His holy Book, so that all Scripture is given 
by inspiration of God” (naoa ygatpr) dednvevozog), 2 Tim. 3, 16. 
Scripture emphatically declares with regard to the sacred writers 
of God’s Book: “The prophecy came not in old time by the will 
of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved ( opego perot ) 
by the Holy Ghost,” 2 Pet. 1, 21. Since the holy men of God spake 
as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, they evidently wrote not 
their own words, but those which God Himself put into their 
minds. This truth is unmistakably taught by St. Paul; for he 
writes: " Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's 
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing 
spiritual things with spiritual,” 1 Cor. 2, 13. The same apostle 
also declares that Christ was speaking in him, 2 Cor. 13,3; and 
of his writings he states that they are “the commandments of the 
Lord,” 1 Cor. 14, 37. The writings of the prophets and apostles 
are therefore the Word of God; they were divinely inspired to write 
the books embodied in our Bible. 

In the Scripture-passages which set forth the doctrine of 
inspiration the following truths are distinctly expressed: — 

a. The inspiration was not simply " inspiration of thoughts” 
(suggestio realis) nor “inspiration of persons’’ (inspiratio per¬ 
sonalis), but verbal inspiration (suggestio verbalis, Verbalinspira- 
tion), i. e., an inspiration by which the Holy Ghost inbreathed the 
very words which the holy penmen were to write. In 2 Tim. 3,16 
Scripture is said to be “God-breathed” (deonrevozog), which means 
that it owes its origin to God notwithstanding the fact that it was 
written by men. In 2 Pet. 1, 21 the apostle distincly declares that 
the holy men, borne along (< pegdpevoi) by the Holy Ghost, spoke, 
t. e., brought forth words (IXakrjoav). Similarly St. Paul says in 
1 Cor. 2, 13: “Which things we speak in words taught by the 
Spirit” (Xakovjuev didaxzoig [koyotg] jzvevpazog). In all these 
passages the verbal inspiration of the Bible is clearly affirmed; for 
since words are the necessary means for conveying thoughts, it lies 
in the very nature of inspiration that the very words were supplied 
to the holy writers. 

All those who deny the verbal inspiration of the Bible and 



102 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


substitute for it “personal inspiration” or “thought inspiration” 
deny the Scriptural doctrine of inspiration altogether and are com¬ 
pelled to teach in its place a mere “illumination,” which is common 
to all believers. Consequently they annul the distinction which 
Scripture itself makes between the norma normans of the prophetic 
and apostolic writings and the norma normata of the uninspired 
books of illuminated dogmaticians and other teachers of the 
Church. In other words, with the denial of the verbal inspiration 
the Bible becomes a human book, which has no greater authority 
than any other Christian book. But just this very thing the Bible 
stamps as false by proclaiming itself to be the divine source and 
norm of faith, to which all believers owe their salvation, Eph. 2, 20; 
John 17, 20; Luke 16, 29; John 8, 31. 32. For this reason we 
reject the statement of Hastings: “Inspiration applies to men, not 
to written words” ( Encycl . of Rel. and Eth., II, 589) and profess 
with R. W. Hiley: " This miraculous operation of the Holy Ohost 
[divine inspiration] had not the writers themselves for its object ,— 
these were only His instruments and were soon to pass away; — its 
objects were the holy books themselves(The Inspiration of 
Scripture, 1885, p. 50.) BaieFs definition of inspiration is in full 
agreement with what Scripture itself teaches on the subject: 
“Divine inspiration was that agency by which God supernaturally 
communicated to the intellect of those who wrote not only the 
correct conception of all that was to be written, but also the con¬ 
ception of the words themselves and of everything by which they 
were to be expressed and by which He also instigated their will to 
the act of writing.” (Doctr. Theol., p. 39.) 

b. The inspiration was not a mere divine assistance or direc¬ 
tion (assistentia, directio, gubernatio divina), but the actual im- 
partation of all the words (suggestio verborum) of which Holy 
Scripture consists. Just as on Pentecost the Holy Spirit graciously 
“gave utterance” to the apostles, Acts 2, 4, so He “gave them utter¬ 
ance” when He impelled them to write down God’s Word and per¬ 
petuate it in Holy Scripture. This truth is clearly expressed in 
the term “God-breathed” (■deonvevorog), which declares that Scrip¬ 
ture has not merely been directed by God, but inspired by Him. 
Of course, the Holy Ghost also guided, directed, and governed the 
holy prophets and apostles, so that they actually wrote down the 
words which He suggested to them; but it is contrary to Scripture 
to identify this divine assistance with the divine act of inspiration. 
Through mere divine guidance or preservation from error Scrip¬ 
ture would have become an errorless human book, but mere divine 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT SCRIPTURE. 


103 


guidance could not have made it an inerrant Book of God, or God’s 
own Word. Such it became only through divine inspiration, or the 
divine suggestio verborum. 

Together with the divine words also their concepts were sug¬ 
gested to the holy writers (suggestio realis), so that on their part 
the act of writing was not merely a mechanical effort, but rather 
a “conscious, volitional, and intelligent act.” The Bible written 
by them was at the same time God’s Booh (causa principalis) and 
their own book (causae instrumentales). Gerhard correctly says 
(11,26): “The instrumental causes of Holy Scripture were holy 
men of God, 2 Pet. 1, 21; that is, men peculiarly and immediately 
elected and called by God for the purpose of committing to writing 
the divine revelations. Such were the prophets of the Old Testa¬ 
ment and the evangelists and apostles of the New Testament, whom 
we therefore properly call the amanuenses of God, the hand of 
Christ, and the scribes, or notaries, of the Holy Spirit, since they 
neither spoke nor wrote by their own will, but, borne along by the 
Holy Spirit ((pego/zevoi vno zov nvev/uazos dyiov), were acted upon, 
led, moved, inspired, apd governed by the Holy Ghost. They wrote 
not as men, but as 'men of God,' that is, as servants of God and 
peculiar organs of the Holy Ghost. Therefore, when a canonical 
book is called a ‘book of Moses,’ the Tsalms of David,’ an 'epistle 
of Paul,’ etc., this is merely a reference to the agent and not to the 
principal cause.” Concerning the efficient, or principal, cause of 
Scripture, Quenstedt says (I, 55): “The efficient, or principal, 
cause of Scripture is the Triune God, 2 Tim. 3,16 (the Father,* 
Heb. 1 , If.; the Son, John 1 , 18; the Holy Ghost, 2 Sam. 23, 2; 
1 Pet. 1,11; 2 Pet. 1, 21): a) by an original decree; b) by sub¬ 
sequent inspiration, or by ordering that holy men of God should 
write, and by inspiring what was to be written.” ( Doctr. Theol., 
p. 42.) 

With regard to the manner in which the holy penmen wrote by 
divine inspiration, Quenstedt writes (I, 55): “God therefore alone, 
if we wish to speak accurately, is to be called the Author of the 
Sacred Scriptures; the prophets and apostles cannot be called the 
authors except by a kind of catachresis." Again (I, 52): “Not as 
though these divine amanuenses wrote ignorantly and unwillingly, 
beyond the reach of, and contrary to, their own will; for they 
wrote cheerfully, willingly, and intelligently. They are said to be 
(pegofievoi, driven, moved, urged on, by the Holy Ghost, not as 
though they were in a state of unconsciousness, as the enthusiasts 



104 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


pretended to be, or in a certain Iv&ovotaojuos, as the heathen 
claimed with regard to their soothsayers; nor, again, ... as though 
the prophets themselves did not understand their own prophecies or 
the things which they wrote, . . . but [they are properly called 
amanuenses] because they wrote nothing of their own accord, but 
everything at the dictation of the Holy Ghost.” ( Doctr. Theol., 
p. 43.) 

c. Inspiration extends not merely to a part of Scripture, for 
example, to its important doctrines, or such matters as before were 
unknown to the holy writers, but the entire Bible (plenary inspira¬ 
tion). This fact is proved by the passage "All Scripture is given 
by inspiration of God,” 2 Tim. 3, 16. From this statement we 
derive the axiom: “Whatever is a part of Holy Scripture is given 
by divine inspiration.” Hence the inspiration includes the whole 
of Scripture, no matter whether it was specially revealed to the 
holy writers or whether they knew it before or whether it was ascer¬ 
tained through study and research. For this reason the historical, 
geographical, archeological, and scientific matters contained in 
Scripture are as truly inspired as are its foremost doctrines. Those 
who deny this and assume degrees of inspiration destroy the very 
concept of inspiration. 

Hollaz thus writes on this point: “There are contained in 
Scripture historical, chronological, genealogical, astronomical, 
scientific, and political matters, which, although the knowledge of 
them is not actually necessary to salvation, are nevertheless divinely 
revealed, because an acquaintance with them assists not a little in 
the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures and in illustrating their 
doctrines and moral precepts. If only the mysteries of the faith 
which are contained in the Holy Scriptures depend on divine inspi¬ 
ration and all the rest, which may be known by the light of nature, 
depends merely on divine direction, then not all of Scripture is 
inspired. But Paul declares that the whole of Scripture is divinely 
inspired. Therefore not only the mysteries of the faith, but also 
the remaining truths revealed in Scripture, which may be known 
also from the light of nature, are divinely suggested and inspired.” 
(Doctr. Theol., p. 46.) 

In the Lutheran Church, George Calixtus (f 1656) taught 
that only the chief articles of faith were inspired, while the less 
important matters or those which were known to the holy writers 
before they were inspired to write were put down by mere divine 
direction or guidance so as to preserve them from error. But this 
doctrine was rejected by the Lutheran dogmaticians as militating 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


106 - 


against the theopneusty of the whole of Scripture (naoa ygaqrg). 
The error of Calixtus has been championed also by Romanistic, 
Calvinistic, and modern rationalistic Lutheran dogmatieians. 

d. Since Holy Scripture is the divinely inspired Word of God, 

its perfect inerrancy in every part and every statement is a priori 
certain because of the infallibility of its divine Author. However, 
Christ directly affirms the absolute inerrancy of Scripture when He 
declares: “Scripture cannot be broken,” John 10, 35. His refer¬ 
ence in this instance was to a single word (fteoi, Ps. 82, 6), 

and if Scripture cannot be broken in the case of a single term, 
then the whole of it must be absolutely true. Similarly the apostles 
frequently refer to single words in the Old Testament as divinely 
inspired and as able to prove truths which they wished to impress 
upon their readers. Cf. Gal. 3,16 with Gen. 17, 7: “He saith not, 
And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy Seed, which 
is Christ”; also Matt. 22, 43. 44 with Ps. 110,1: “The Lord said 
unto my Lord”; also John 10, 35 with Ps. 82, 6. Such references 
prove that not only the very words (suggestio verbalis), but even 
the very forms in which they occur (suggestio literalis) have been 
inspired. In accord with this is God’s prohibition not to add to His 
Word nor to take away from it even the least particle, Deut. 4, 2; 
12, 32; Prov. 30, 5. 6; Rev. 22, 18. 19, as also Christ’s warning 
that “whosoever shall break one of these least commandments shall 
be called the least in the kingdom of heaven,” Matt. 5,19, since “it 
is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the Law to 
fail,” Luke 16, 17; Matt. 5, 18. Hence, as St. Paul professed: 
“I believe all things which are written in the Law and in the 
Prophets,” Acts 24,14, so also every believing Christian must re¬ 
gard Holy Scripture in its entirety as divinely inspired and there¬ 
fore absolutely infallible. Luther writes: “Scripture has never 
erred” (St. L., XV, 1481), and Calov: “No error, even in unim¬ 
portant matters, no defect of memory, not to say untruth, can have 
any place in all the Scriptures” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 49). Similarly 
Hollaz declares: “Divine inspiration, by which the subject-matter 
and the words, those to be spoken as well as those to be written, 
were immediately suggested to the prophets and apostles by the 
Holy Spirit, preserved them free from all error in the preaching 
as well as in the writing of the divine Word.” (Ibid.) 

e. The inspiration of Holy Scripture includes lastly also the- 
divine impulse and command to write (impulsus et mandatum 
scribendi). The impulsus scribendi is proved by the fact that the 
holy writers are said to have been moved {(pegopevot, 2 Pet. 1, 21). 



106 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT SCRIPTURE. 


to write, and for this reason the apostle adds the statement: 
"Prophecy came not by the will of man.” In other words, the Holy 
Scriptures were written, not because men, but because God willed 
this. Hollaz is therefore right when he says: "Inspiration de¬ 
notes the antecedent divine instigation or peculiar impulse of the 
will to engage in writing as well as the immediate illumination by 
which the mind of the sacred writer was fully enlightened.” 
( Doctr. Theol., p. 43.) And Quenstedt writes: "All the canon¬ 
ical books of the Old and the New Testament were written by God, 
who peculiarly incited and impelled the sacred writers to engage 
in the work.” {Doctr. Theol., p. 44.) Answering the objection of 
papistic theologians that it is impossible to trace a special divine 
command in every instance, Gerhard declares (II, 30): “In the 
holy men of God the external command and the internal impulse 
coincide; for what else is that divine impulse than an internal and 
secret command of precisely the same authority and weight as one 
that is external and manifest?” (Ibid.) The Roman Catholic doc¬ 
trine, according to which the inspiration of the Bible is admitted, 
the impulsus scribendi, however, denied, is self-contradictory; for if 
God gave Scripture by divine inspiration, then He surely also 
moved the holy writers to record His Word. Roman Catholic 
theology denies the mandatum divinum in the interest of exalting 
the unwritten traditions above the written Word of God, just as 
modern rationalistic Protestant theologians deny the impulsus 
scribendi in the interest of elevating their reason (their "Chris¬ 
tian consciousness” or "Christian experience”) above the Bible. 
In both cases the denial is prompted by insubordination over 
against the divine Author of the Bible. 

4. THE RELATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO THE 
HOLY WRITERS. 

The relation of the inspiring Holy Spirit to the inspired holy 
writers is clearly described in all those passages of Holy Scripture 
which tell us that the Lord — or the Holy Ghost — spoke “by the 
prophets” (Matt. 1,22; 2,15) or “by the mouth of the prophets” 
(Acts 1,16; 4,25), and this in such a manner that the word of 
the prophets and the apostles was by this very act the Word of God 
(Heb. 3, 7; Rom. 3, 2). All these expressions declare that the Holy 
Spirit employed the holy writers as His organs, or instruments, or 
that they were “His mouth” in revealing His holy Word, both 
orally and in writing. To describe this instrumental character of 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT SCRIPTURE. 


107 


the holy writers, our dogmaticians as well as the ancient Church 
Fathers called them “penmen/’ “amanuenses,” “the hand of 
Christ,” “scribes and notaries of the Holy Ghost,” etc. These ex¬ 
pressions are perfectly correct as long as the tertium comparationis 
in these figures of speech is strictly kept in view. What these 
terms express is the simple fact that the holy writers were agents 
of God in handing down His Word, either orally or in writing. 
It is self-evident that the holy writers were not mechanical, but 
conscious and intelligent instruments, so that they wrote " cheer¬ 
fully, willingly, and intelligently” (Quenstedt). Modern ration¬ 
alistic theologians therefore ought to accept these expressions as 
truly Scriptural and not heap mockery upon those who use them. 
In the final analysis their contempt for these terms is prompted 
by contempt for the Holy Bible itself and its divine doctrine of 
inspiration. 

The Scriptural phrase “by the prophets” accounts also for the 
variety of style which is found in Holy Scripture. If the various 
books of the Bible evince different styles of writing, this is because 
the Holy Ghost engaged different men (kings, peasants, fishermen, 
scholars, etc.) to compose His holy Book. Quenstedt remarks on 
this point (I, 76): “There is a great diversity among the sacred 
writers in regard to style and mode of speaking, which evidently 
arose from the fact that the Holy Spirit accommodated Himself 
to the ordinary mode of speaking, leaving to each one his own 
manner; yet we do not thereby deny that the Holy Spirit suggested 
the particular words to these individuals.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 47 f.) 
Questions such as the following: “Was the Old Testament written 
originally with vowel-points or not?” “May the language of the 
Bible be called classic?” and many others which have been raised 
in connection with the doctrine of inspiration, are purely historical 
and have nothing to do with the doctrine of inspiration. For this 
reason no controversies ought to be waged about them. Let it 
suffice to say that in all external matters the Holy Spirit accom¬ 
modated Himself to the peculiar conditions that prevailed at the 
time when He gave His Word to the world. 

5. OBJECTIONS TO THE DOCTRINE OF INSPIRATION. 

As early as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, papists, 
Socinians, Arminians, and enthusiasts assumed that Holy Scrip¬ 
ture contains certain errors. Even Calvin occasionally imputed to 
the evangelists general inaccuracies and incorrect quotations from 
the Old Testament. Within the Lutheran Church, as already 



108 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


stated, George Calixtus, in the seventeenth century, departed from 
the Scriptural doctrine of inspiration by teaching that in all matters 
that are not essential or that were known to the holy writers they 
were not inspired, but merely directed or preserved from error. At 
the close of the eighteenth and at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century the prevailing rationalism resulted in the complete sur¬ 
render of the entire Christian doctrine, including that of the divine 
inspiration of the Bible. Present-day Modernism is a direct ex¬ 
crescence of this crass rationalism. Modern “positive” or “conser¬ 
vative” theology, which rejected the bland and stupid rationalism 
of the preceding era, failed to return to the Scriptural doctrine 
of inspiration, and even modern “Lutheran” theologians in Ger¬ 
many reject the verbal inspiration of the Bible, or the doctrine that 
Holy Scripture is a priori God’s Word, maintaining that the char¬ 
acter of Scripture must be determined historically, or a posteriori 
by way of human investigation. 

The result of their “investigation” therefore is that the Holy 
Scripture is not the Word of God, but rather a human account of 
divine revelations (“Offenbarungsurlcunde”), which, though more 
or less influenced by the Holy Spirit, is not without error and must 
therefore be subjected to the critical judgment of Bible scholars. 
These theologians still speak of “inspiration”; yet they do not 
mean that true inspiration by which Holy Scripture has become 
the unique source and norm of faith until the end of time (John 
17,20; Eph. 2, 20), but merely an intensified illumination, which 
is found more or less in all Christian authors. 

The same may be said of most American theologians, although 
among them Charles Hodge, William Shedd, and Benjamin War- 
field have defended the Scriptural doctrine of verbal and plenary 
inspiration. In Germany there is at the present time hardly 
a single outstanding university professor who still upholds the doc¬ 
trine of verbal and plenary inspiration. This all but universal 
denial of inspiration is one of the saddest chapters in the history 
of the Christian Church; for every one who repudiates the inspi¬ 
ration of the Bible subverts the foundation upon which the Chris¬ 
tian faith rests and falls under the condemnation of God, Matt. 
11, 25. In the last analysis all objections to the inspiration of 
the Bible flow from the carnal, unbelieving heart, Rom. 8, 7; 
1 Cor. 2, 14. 

Among the objections raised against the Biblical doctrine of 
inspiration the following may be noted: — 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT SCRIPTURE. 


109 


a. The different style in the various books of the Bible , or more 
exactly, the claim that God’s peculiar style would be found through¬ 
out the Bible were He really its divine Author. Our reply to this 
criticism is that in general God’s unique style is indeed noticeable 
throughout Holy Scripture, which bears the ineffaceable imprint of 
its divine Author on every page. The simplicity, majesty, and 
sublimity of the Biblical style are found in no book written by 
men; in fact, the style of the Bible is so unique that there is only 
one Holy Bible in the world. We may apply to Scripture the 
words that were spoken with regard to our Savior: “Never man 
spake like this man,” John 7, 46. If within this general scope the 
various books of the Bible differ from one another somewhat in 
style and diction, we must remember that the Holy Spirit, in 
giving His holy Word to men, always accommodated Himself to 
the holy writers whom He employed in His holy service. Calov 
says very fittingly: “There may be recognized in it [the Bible] 
a condescension of the Holy Spirit; for He sometimes accommo¬ 
dated Himself to the ordinary method of speaking, allowing the 
writers their own style of speech.” This, correctly understood, is 
the “human side” of Scripture. This expression, however, must 
not be taken in the sense of modern rationalistic theologians, who 
apply it to certain portions of Holy Writ, which they reject as 
“erroneous” and therefore as “uninspired.” 

In opposition to modern rationalistic theology the Christian 
believer stands firm upon the vital truth that Holy Scripture has 
no “uninspired parts” whatsoever, but that it is in all its parts 
the inerrant Word of God, given by divine inspiration. Instead 
of criticizing the different styles of Scripture, men ought to recog¬ 
nize in this fact God’s gracious condescension and wonderful love; 
for by giving us His heavenly doctrines through so many different 
writers, who address us in so many different ways, He rendered 
His sublime Word all the more intelligible and acceptable to man¬ 
kind. Had God spoken to us in the language which is used in 
heaven, not a single person in this world could have understood 
His Word and learned from it the way of salvation, 2 Cor. 12,4. 

b. The variant readings in the copies of Scripture. Variant 
readings (variae lectiones) are indeed found in the copies of the 
holy writings of the prophets and apostles that have been preserved 
to us. However, since the variant readings occur only in the 
copies, they furnish no argument whatsoever against the divine 
inspiration of the Bible, since the variants owe their origin to 



110 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


lapses in transcription. In spite of the variant readings, however, 
the texts which we have to-day contain the Word of God both in 
its original purity and its original entirety. This we know a priori 
from Christ’s direct promise (John 17, 20; 8, 31. 32; Matt. 28, 20; 
John 10,35; Matt. 24, 35; Luke 21,33; 16,17) and a posteriori 
from the fact, ascertained by scientific investigation, that in spite 
of the numerous variae lectiones not a single doctrine of God’s 
Word has been rendered doubtful or uncertain. God, who has 
given us His Word, has also graciously preserved it to the present 
day and will preserve it to the end of time (gubernatio divina). 
We recognize God’s providence also in the many repetitions of His 
doctrines throughout the Bible. As a result of this, even if entire 
books (Antilegomena) or entire passages (Mark 16, 9—20) are 
called into question, we may still prove the divine doctrines from 
other books and passages in the Bible, which are universally 
acknowledged as authentic and canonical (Homologumena ). 

c. The study and research of the holy writers. Independent 
study and historical research were indeed carried on at times by 
the holy writers; for they themselves tell us that they were 
prompted to write not only new revelations, but also such things 
as they knew in consequence of their general study and their 
special experience. Gal. 1,17—24; Luke 1, Iff. However, this fact 
does not disprove the doctrine of inspiration, since the Holy Spirit 
utilized for His beneficent purpose of giving to fallen man the 
Word of God also the general knowledge of the sacred penmen, 
just as He utilized their natural gifts and talents (experience, style, 
culture, etc.). Inspiration is not mere revelation, but the divine 
prompting (impulsus scribendi) to record the truths which God 
desired that men should know in words He Himself supplied, 
2 Sam. 23, 2ff. Some of these truths were given the holy writers 
by direct revelation, 1 Cor. 11, 23; 14,37; 2,7—13; others were 
known to them by experience, Acts 17, 28; Gal. 2,11—14; others, 
again, by direct investigation and special research, Luke 1, 1 ff. 

In the treatment of the doctrine of divine inspiration the 
question is not: “How did the holy writers obtain the truths which 
they wrote ?” but rather: “Did the Holy Ghost prompt the sacred 
writers to write down certain words and thoughts which God 
wanted men to know ?” The fact that this was actually the case is 
clearly taught in Holy Scripture, 2 Tim. 3,16; 2 Pet. 1, 21, so that 
the doctrine of inspiration is beyond dispute. When on Pentecost 
the apostles proclaimed to the multitude salvation by the risen 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


Ill 


Savior, who had suffered and died for the sins of the world, they 
announced facts which to a large extent were known to them by 
experience, John 20, 20 f.; 21,12; yet of all the words which they 
proclaimed Scripture says: “They began to speak ... as the Spirit 
gave them utterance,” Acts 2, 4. Not only in that Pentecostal 
preaching, but in the composition of all their writings the Holy 
Spirit “gave utterance” to the apostles. 

d. Alleged contradictions in the Bible. In connection with 
this point we distinguish between external and internal contra¬ 
dictions. By external contradictions we mean the seeming his¬ 
torical discrepancies in the Bible. Internal contradictions pertain 
to doctrines. With regard to real contradictions in doctrine, we 
know a priori that none can occur, — though to human reason this 
often appears to be the case, — since the whole Bible is the Word of 
the infallible God, 2 Tim. 3,16; 2 Pet. 1,21. Even if two doc¬ 
trines of Scripture seem to contradict each other (e. g., gratia uni¬ 
versalis, electio particularis), the Christian theologian never admits 
a real contradiction, 2 Cor. 1,18—20, but only a partial revelation, 
1 Cor. 13, 9, which will be perfected in glory, 1 Cor. 13,10.12. For 
this reason the Christian believer teaches both doctrines side by 
side in their given purity, without any attempt on his part to bridge 
over the gap or to solve the apparent discrepancy, Rev. 22,18.19. 

External contradictions, or seeming historical discrepancies, 
occur in Scripture especially in quotations from the Old Testament, 
1 Cor. 10, 8 and Num. 25, 9. The variants in the manuscripts, 
owing to faulty transcription, add to the number of these seeming 
contradictions. The wonder, however, is not that such seeming 
contradictions do occur in the Bible, — for we must not forget that 
the copyists were fallible men, who were subject to error in tran¬ 
scribing the sacred text, — but rather that, relatively speaking, 
there are so few of them and that in most cases they can be satis¬ 
factorily adjusted. (Cf. Dr. W. Arndt’s Does the Bible Contradict 
Itselff) 

But even if the Christian theologian cannot adjust an apparent 
historical discrepancy to his full satisfaction, he does not charge 
Scripture with error, but leaves the matter undecided, mindful of 
Christ’s declaration that “the Scripture cannot be broken,” John 
10, 35. Particulars with regard to this subject belong to the 
domain of Christian isagogics, where they receive detailed con¬ 
sideration; but the dogmatician is concerned with the matter in 
so far as it is his duty to point out the correct principles which 



112 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


must guide the Bible student in his estimation of Scripture as 
God’s inspired Word. Foremost among these is the basic truth 
that it is unworthy of a Christian theologian to criticize the in- 
errant Word of God; for it is his function to teach the Gospel, 
Mark 16, 15. 16; Matt. 28, 20, and not to oppose the infallible 
Word by his own fallible views and judgments, 1 Tim. 6, 3—5. 
(Cf. Luther on the historical reliability of Scripture, St. L., XIV, 
490 ff.) In passing, we may add that the seeming historical dis¬ 
crepancies in the Bible never affect the doctrines which Scripture 
teaches for our salvation. 

e. Inaccurate quotations in the New Testament. It is asserted 
that the Bible cannot be the inspired Word of God because the 
New Testament so frequently quotes the Old Testament “inac¬ 
curately” and even “wrongly.” The argument is that, if the Bible 
were the infallible Word of God, the citations from the Old Testa¬ 
ment that are given in the New Testament would always be exact, 
or literal. This, however, is not the case. Sometimes the apostles 
quote the Old Testament literally; sometimes they quote the read¬ 
ing of the Septuagint; at other times they quote the Septuagint, 
but correct it according to the Hebrew original; finally, sometimes 
they reproduce neither the Hebrew text nor the Septuagint, but 
state the general scope of the text in their own words. This 
divergent manner of quoting the Old Testament, however, does not 
disprove the fact of divine inspiration of the Bible; on the con¬ 
trary, it rather proves it, since evidently the divine Author of the 
whole Bible quoted His holy words as it pleased Him. Had the 
New Testament writers been impostors, they would have been 
obliged to quote the Old Testament literally in every instance; 
for it would have been in their interest to prove to their readers 
their extensive acquaintance and perfect agreement with the Old 
Testament. As it was, the Holy Spirit, who spoke through them, 
directed them to cite and apply the Word of God as the occasion 
required and as His holy purposes were best served, Gal. 4,21—31. 
It is always the privilege of an author to quote his writings as he 
sees fit, and this prerogative must not be denied to the Holy Spirit. 

f. Trivial matters in Scripture. The inspiration of the Bible 
has further been denied on the ground that it contains “trivial 
things” (levicula) and, besides, bad grammar, poor rhetoric, bar¬ 
barisms, solecisms, and the like. Examples of trivial matters, it 
is asserted, are the minutely reported domestic affairs of the patri¬ 
archs, their manifold sins and failings, the dietetic prescription for 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT SCRIPTURE.

Timothy that he should use a little wine for his stomach’s sake, 

1 Tim. 5, 23, Paul’s request for his cloak, books, and parchments, 

2 Tim. 4,13, and others. These levicvla, it is said, are unworthy of 
the Holy Spirit and would not have been mentioned by Him if He 
really were the Author of Scripture. 

However, this argument does not apply; for if God made the 
vine, should He not prescribe its correct use? If He deigned to 
establish the home, should He not picture in Scripture a few home 
scenes for our instruction, warning, and comfort, 2 Tim. 3,16 ? If 
the very hairs on our heads are all numbered, Matt. 10, 30, must 
not the "trivial things” in the lives of God’s saints be regarded as 
of the greatest concern to Him ? Some of the most weighty lessons 
of faith and piety attach to the "trivial things” which Holy Scrip¬ 
ture inculcates (the right use of the divinely prescribed means; the 
apostle’s devotion to the Gospel in spite of his poverty; the apostle’s 
studiousness, which prompted him to demand books even when he 
was in prison). It is not the business of any theologian to pre¬ 
scribe to God what kind of Bible He should write or to find fault 
with the Bible which He did write, but to teach with holy reverence 
and devout submission the entire Word of salvation which God 
in His infinite grace was pleased to bequeath to lost mankind as 
the source of faith and the norm of life. Acts 20,17—28. 

The argument against the inspiration of Scripture which is 
based upon the so-called barbarisms, solecisms, grammatical 
errors, etc., must be rejected as ignoring the well-known fact 
that the New Testament was written in the xotvrj, or the universal 
popular speech of that time, which differed greatly from classical 
Greek, but was understood by practically all peoples and tribes in 
the Roman Empire. The Holy Spirit chose this language because 
He wished the writings of His holy penmen to be understood by 
the common people. Col. 4,16; 1 Thess. 5, 27, from whose Tanks 
the first Christian churches were largely organized, Rom. 16, 3—16. 
The Greek of the New Testament is not "vulgar” or "bad” Greek; 
it was the vernacular of the people (Volkssprache) in the period 
when Christianity was spread in the heathen world and the Holy 
Bible was written. The Hebraisms in the New Testament are not 
anomalies, but are found in all writings where Jewish influence 
exerted itself upon the common Greek. 

g. Special Scripture-passages are said to deny inspiration. 
Those who deny the divine inspiration of the Bible also point out 
certain Scripture-passages which allegedly contradict the fact of 

CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 8 



114 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


inspiration. Of these the foremost is 1 Cor. 7,12: “To the rest 
speak I, not the Lord,” contrasted with 1 Cor. 7,10: “Unto the 
married I command, yet not I, but the Lord.” Luther explains 
this passage by saying that here the apostle does not inculcate 
a divine commandment, but merely gives counsel in a matter which 
concerned the life of the Corinthian Christians. “He distinguishes 
his words from those of the Lord in such a way that the Word of 
the Lord should be a commandment, but his word should be 
a counsel.” (St. L., VIII, 1058.) This explanation is supported 
by 1 Cor. 7, 25. Both statements are certainly inspired; but while 
v. 2 of this chapter gives the principle, v. 12 ff. the apostolic counsel 
for the contingency. It must not be overlooked that St. Paul wrote 
this entire epistle as “an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will 
of God,” 1 Cor. 1,1, so that “the things that he wrote” were “the 
commandments of the Lord,” 1 Cor. 14, 37. It has been suggested, 
moreover, that, since Paul was accustomed to support his state¬ 
ments by quotations from the Old Testament or from the teachings 
of Jesus, he merely wished to indicate that in this instance he had 
no definite commandment from the Lord to which he might refer 
his readers, but was uttering a hitherto unexplained truth as an 
inspired apostle. This explanation is quite plausible, since mani¬ 
festly in 1 Cor. 7,10 he alludes to Matt. 19, 6. 9. Certainly this one 
passage gives us no right whatever to deny the divine inspiration 
of Scripture, which is attested in so many clear passages, especially 
since the apostle himself deprecates this conclusion, 1 Cor. 14, 37. 

h. The alleged evil consequences of the doctrine of inspiration. 
This argument is preferred quite commonly by the exponents of 
modern theology. Asserting that the “Christian consciousness” or 
“Christian experience” or human reason must be recognized as 
a principium cognoscendi and chafing under the divine restraint, 
1 Pet. 4,11, they allege that belief in the divine inspiration of Holy 
Scripture would result in “intellectualism,” “Biblicism,” “letter 
service,” “the constraint of the free spirit of investigation,” “the 
failure to find new religious truths,” “the inability of the theo¬ 
logian to accommodate himself to present-day religious thought,” 
“sectarianism,” and the like. 

All these objections may be traced back to the same source, 
namely, to the averseness of rationalistic and naturalistic theo¬ 
logians to being bound to divine truth definitely fixed in a Scrip¬ 
tural canon. As a matter of fact, if the Bible is God’s holy Book, 
given to men as the only source and norm of faith and life until 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


115 


the end of time, then any doctrine which is contrary to Scripture 
is eo ipso condemned and rejected. Eationalism repudiates the 
doctrine of divine inspiration in order that it may spread its own 
false teachings and pernicious errors. But just for that very reason 
the Word of God is so emphatic in condemning every departure 
from God’s holy truth revealed in Scripture, Rom. 16,17; 2 John 
9—11; 1 Tim. 1, 3; 6, 3ff., and in inculcating the most steadfast 
adherence to the Bible, Matt. 5,18—19; Rev. 22,18.19. In the 
last analysis there is only one reason why men reject the doctrine 
of the divine inspiration of the Bible, namely, unbelief, or revolt 
against God and His established Word. 

6. THE DOCTRINE OF INSPIRATION AND CONFESSIONAL 

LUTHERANISM. 

In answer to the claim that the doctrine of inspiration is 
a “dogmatic construction,” which owes its origin to the later dog- 
maticians of the Lutheran Church, we point to the fact that already 
in its Confessions the Lutheran Church upheld the plenary inspira¬ 
tion of the Bible, although at that time the doctrine was not in 
controversy, so that there was no pressing need for presenting it in 
detail. A few quotations from our Confessions show in what way 
the writers regarded the Holy Bible. We read: “Whence have 
the bishops the right to lay these traditions upon the Church . . . 
when Peter, Acts 15,10, forbids to put a yoke upon the neck of the 
disciples and Paul says, 2 Cor. 13,10, that the power given him was 
to edification? Did the Holy Ghost in vain forewarn of these 
things?" (Augsburg Conf., Art. XXVIII.) Again: “You have 
now therefore, reader, our Apology, from which you will understand 
not only what the adversaries have judged, . . . but also that they 
have condemned several articles contrary to the manifest Scripture 
of the Holy Ghost." (Apol., § 9. Triglot, p. 101.) Again: “In this 
way the distinction between the Holy Scriptures of the Old and the 
New Testament and all other writings is preserved, and the Holy 
Scriptures alone remain the only judge, rule, and standard accord¬ 
ing to which, as the only touchstone, cdl dogmas shall and must be 
discerned and judged as to whether they are good or evil, right or 
wrong.” ( Formula of Concord, Epitome, § 7; Triglot, p. 779.) 

From these and many other statements in our Confessions it 
is obvious that their writers regarded the Holy Bible as the inspired 
and infallible Word of God; hence the claim that the doctrine of 
verbal and plenary inspiration is “an artificial theory of the later 



110 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT SCRIPTURE. 


dogmaticians” (“eine kuenstliche Theorie der spaeteren Dogma- 
tiker”) is unfounded. The later Lutheran dogmaticians taught no 
other doctrine concerning Holy Scripture than that which was 
maintained and defended in the Lutheran Confessions. 

Closely related to the claim just stated is another, namely, 
that Luther himself did not regard the Bible as verbally and 
plenarily inspired, but that he assumed a “free attitude” on this 
point. However, Luther’s position, or attitude, toward the Bible 
was the very opposite of “free”; for time and again he professed 
himself to be bound to God’s Word, set forth in Scripture, as the 
following statements of his plainly show: “Holy Scripture was 
spoken through the Holy Ghost.” (St. L., Ill, 1895.) Again: 
“The Bible is ‘God’s Letter’ to men.” (I, 1055.) Again: “The 
Bible did not grow upon earth.” (VII, 2095.) Etc. While Lu¬ 
ther’s chief opponents, the papists, asserted the traditions, the 
decisions of the church councils, and the decrees of the Popes to be 
sources of faith, Luther recognized but one standard of faith — 
God’s Book, the Bible. In it “the Holy Spirit so speaks to us” 
that even “the trivial things” in it are the teachings of the “high 
divine Majesty.” (St. L., XIV, 2ff.) In it “the absolutely pure 
mouth of the Holy Spirit” revealed even the “atrocious, indecent 
tale” of Judah and Tamar (Gen. 38) for our comfort. (St. L., 
II, 1200 ff.) Even as to historical and scientific matters recorded 
in Scripture we must “do the Holy Spirit the honor of admitting 
that He is more learned than we are.” (St. L., Ill, 21; XV, 1481.) 
The Holy Spirit did not commit any mistakes even in the 
chronology of Scripture. (St. L., I, 713 ff.) Modern rationalistic 
theologians hold that there are “degrees of inspiration,” a view 
which practically denies the entire inspiration of Scripture. 
Luther, on the contrary, “assigned the whole Bible to the Holy 
Ghost.” (St. L., Ill, 1890.) Ad Ps. 127,3 he says that not only 
the words (vocabula), but the very mode of expression (phrasis) 
is divine (divina). (St. L., IV, 1960.) 

In view of these express declarations of Luther the alleged 
proofs from his writings on behalf of his “free position” sink into 
insignificance from the very outset. Luther is supposed to have 
taught that the Bible contains “hay, straw, and stubble,” in other 
words, truth and error. But this quotation is incorrect; for when 
using those words, Luther did not refer to the Biblical writers, but 
to the interpreters of the Bible. (Kawerau, Theol. Lii.-Ztg., 1895, 
p. 216; cf. also Christliche Dogmatik, Vol. I, p. 346 ff.) What 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


117 


Luther here says of the interpreters of the Bible in olden times 
(St. L., XIY, 150) is true of all Bible interpreters to this day; for 
sometimes they err in explaining the sacred text. 

Again, Luther is said to have taught that certain passages in 
Scripture are “inadequate.” The reference in this case is especially 
to Gal. 4, 21 ff., on which passage he remarked that in a controversy 
with Jews (contra Iudaeos), who did not accept Paul’s apostolic 
authority, it is less valid in controversy (in acie mimes valet) than 
others; or according to some German translations, it is “zum Stick 
zu schwach’ > that is to say, it does not convince. By this expres¬ 
sion, however, Luther did not mean to deny the doctrine of inspira¬ 
tion, but merely wished to indicate that Paul’s allegory, as used in 
this passage, would not convince an unbelieving Jew, who did not 
accept the apostle’s authority. This certainly is true, especially 
6ince Paul in his interpretation departs from the literal sense of 
the words and shows its allegorical meaning, as Luther rightly 
points out. (Cf. St. L., I, 1150.) 

Moreover, Luther’s “free position” with respect to Scripture 
is supposed to appear from his sharp distinction between the 
Homologumena and the Antilegomena in the New Testament 
canon. We admit the fact that Luther did make distinctions (e. g., 
the epistle of James he calls a “strawy epistle” as compared with 
Paul’s epistles, St. L., XIY, 91); but at the same time he 
regarded all the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures as God’s 
divinely inspired Word, just as we do to-day, though we, too, 
acknowledge the distinction between Homologumena and Antile¬ 
gomena. Furthermore it is said that Luther accepted a “canon 
within the canon,” since he limited the divine authority of the 
Bible to those books which "urge Christ” (“Christum treiben”). 
The passages on which this contention is based are found in the 
St. Louis Ed. (XIV, 129, and XIX, 1441) and read: “Whatever 
does not urge Christ is not yet apostolic, even if St. Peter or 
St. Paul should teach it. On the other hand, whatever teaches 
Christ, that is apostolic, even if Judas, Annas, Pilate, or Herod 
should do it.” And: “If our adversaries insist upon Scripture, we 
insist upon Christ against Scripture.” As strange as these state¬ 
ments may sound when they are removed from their context, they 
become perfectly clear when they are considered in their con¬ 
nection. By Scripture Luther here does not mean the Bible per se, 
but as it was falsely interpreted by the papists. This fully explains 
the second quotation. The first is explained by the fact that 



118 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


Luther here assumes a case which in reality can never occur, since 
neither St. Paul nor St. Peter could teach anything without “urging 
Christ,” nor would Annas, Pilate, or Herod “urge Christ,” no 
matter what they presumed to teach. Luther’s insistence here was 
upon the authority of the divine Christ whom the Bible teaches 
from beginning to end as the Church’s only Lord, Luke 24, 26—27; 
Acts 10,43. 

Whatever other arguments have been advanced to prove Lu¬ 
ther’s “free position” with regard to Holy Scripture come under 
the same category as those cited above. In the interest of their 
pernicious designs modern theologians either misquote Luther or 
misapply his statements. In spite of this, however, they cannot 
disprove the clear words in which Luther emphatically professes his 
devoted loyalty to Scripture as God’s own inspired Book. 

7. THE DENIAL OF THE DOCTRINE OF INSPIRATION — 
ITS CAUSE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. 

The amazing apostasy of modern Protestant theologians from 
the Biblical doctrine of inspiration is strikingly depicted in Has¬ 
tings’s Encyclopedia, where we read: “Protestant scholars of the 
present day, imbued with the scientific spirit, have no a-priori 
theory of the inspiration of the Bible. . . . They do not open any 
book of the Old or New Testament with the feeling that they are 
bound to regard its teaching as sacred and authoritative. They 
yield to nothing but what they regard as the irresistible logic of 
facts. . . . And if in the end they formulate a doctrine of the 
divine influence under which the Scriptures were written, this is 
an inference from the characteristics which, after free and fair 
investigation, they are constrained to recognize.” And again: 
“To sum up, the old doctrine of the equal and infallible inspira¬ 
tion of every part of the Old Testament ... is now rapidly disap¬ 
pearing among Protestants. There is in reality no clean dividing- 
line between what is and what is not worthy of a place in the 
Scriptures.” (VII, 346, et al .) In a similar vein the late Theodor 
Kaftan wrote: “We are realists” (Wirlelichkeitsmenschen), which 
he explains to mean: “We do not regard as authoritative what 
Scripture teaches of itself, but only what we profess as divine 
truth according to the impression which Scripture makes upon us.” 
(Moderne Theologie des adten Olaubens, 2, pp. 108.113.) 

This express denial of the divine inspiration of Holy Scripture 
in spite of its own clear and unmistakable testimony is prompted, 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


119 


in the last analysis, only by unbelief, or the sheer refusal of human 
reason to accept the truth of God’s Word. It was so in Christ’s 
time, when our Lord reproved the unbelieving Jews: “Because 
I tell you the truth, ye believe Me not. ... If I say the truth, 
why do ye not believe Me ? He that is of God heareth God’s words; 
ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God,” John 8, 
45—47, and it is so to-day. In his criticism of the unbelief of the 
Pharisees, Christ became very severe and rebuked them thus: “Ye 
are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. 
He was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth, 
because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he 
speaketh of his own; for he is a liar and the father of it,” John 
8, 44. This criticism of the carnal heart, which rejects God’s Word, 
applies with the same force and emphasis to-day. Rationalistic 
theologians to-day accuse the “later Lutheran dogmaticians” of 
having invented “an artificial theory” (“eine kuenstliche Theorie”) 
when they taught the verbal and plenary inspiration of the Bible; 
they thus became guilty of a historical falsehood. In addition, they 
resort to logical fallacies to bolster up their rejection of God’s Word, 
claiming that the doctrine of inspiration is disproved by the dif¬ 
ferent style of the various writers, their private study and research, 
the variae lectiones in the copies, and the like. However, the real 
source of every denial of the doctrine of inspiration is unbelief. 

The consequences of the denial of Biblical inspiration are in¬ 
deed far-reaching. As a matter of fact, Christianity stands and 
falls with this doctrine; for if there is no inspired Scripture, there 
can be no divine doctrine. In particular, all who deny the divine 
inspiration of the Bible, and as long as they do so, have no pos¬ 
sibility of ever knowing the divine truth; for this is possible only 
in case men “continue in Christ’s Word,” John 8, 31. 32; 1 Tim. 
6, 3. 4. Moreover they give up faith in the Christian sense, since 
faith comes alone by hearing God’s Word, Rom. 10,17; Jas. 1,18; 
1 Pet. 1, 23. So, too, they give up Christian prayer with all its 
temporal and eternal blessings; for this presupposes faithful ad¬ 
herence to the words of Christ, as He Himself teaches: “If ye 
abide in Me and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, 
and it shall be done unto you,” John 15, 7. Again, they give up 
the possibility of triumphing over death; for only he “shall never 
see death” who keeps Christ’s saying, John 8, 51. They also give 
up the only means by which the Christian Church is built upon 
earth, namely, the precious Gospel of Christ, Mark 16, 15. 16; 



120 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


Matt. 28, 19. 20; 2 John 9. 10. They likewise give up the only 
means by which the Christian Church may be preserved in its true 
unity of faith, Eph. 4, 3—6, as Luther rightly says: “The Word 
and the doctrine must make Christian unity and communion.” 
(St. L., IX, 831.) In addition, they give up all communion with 
God, since we can find our precious Lord only in His Word, John 
6,67—69; 17,17; Luke 11,28; John 5, 24. Lastly they pervert 
the “wisdom that is from above,” or “the wisdom of God in a mys¬ 
tery, which God ordained before the world unto our glory,” but 
which “has never entered into the heart of man,” Jas. 3,17 ; 1 Cor. 
2, 7—9, into a doctrine of men, or into a “wisdom which descendeth 
not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish,” Jas. 3,15; for the 
denial of the divine inspiration of the Bible is invariably joined 
with the denial of the saving Gospel of Christ and with the teach¬ 
ing^ of the pagan doctrine of work-righteousness. Rationalism 
begins with the disavowal of the doctrine of inspiration and ends 
with the repudiation of all the divine doctrines of Holy Scripture, 
unless by God’s grace this destructive process is checked by a “for¬ 
tunate inconsistency,” by which in practise the conclusions are not 
drawn from the premises that are theoretically maintained. If 
Paul’s earnest warning “Be not deceived ; God is not mocked; for 
whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap,” Gal. 6, 7, applies 
anywhere, it applies especially to man’s attitude toward the Scrip¬ 
tural doctrine of divine inspiration. 

8. THE PROPERTIES OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 

Because the Bible is the Word of God, it possesses distinct 
divine properties, or attributes (affectiones divinae). These are: 
divine authority (auctoritas divina), divine efficacy (efficacia di¬ 
vina), divine perfection (perfedio divina), and divine perspicuity 
(perspicuitas divina). It is self-evident that these divine proper¬ 
ties must be denied to Scripture if its divine inspiration is rejected, 
for they follow from the fact that the Bible is God’s own inspired 
and infallible Word. 

A. THE DIVINE AUTHORITY OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 

By the divine authority of Holy Scripture we mean the pecu¬ 
liar quality of the whole Bible according to which as the true Word 
of God it demands faith and obedience of all men and is and re¬ 
mains the only source and norm of faith and life. Our Savior Him¬ 
self acknowledged and asserted the divine authority of the Bible by 
quoting it in all cases of controversy as the only standard of truth, 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT SCRIPTURE. 


121 


John 10, 35; Matt. 4, 4—10; 26, 54; Luke 24, 25—27; etc. And 
the holy apostles claimed divine authority not only for the Scrip¬ 
tures of the Old Testament, but also for their own inspired writings, 
1 Cor. 14,37. 38; 2 Cor. 13, 3; Gal. 1, 8; 2 Thess. 3, 6.14; 2,15. 
Whoever therefore rejects Scripture or subjects it to human censor¬ 
ship and criticism becomes guilty of high treason against God; 
for Scripture possesses its divine authority not because of the holy 
men who wrote it nor because of the Christian Church, which re¬ 
veres and teaches it, but from the living God, who has inspired 
holy men to write it. In other words, the Bible has divine authority 
because it is in every part the inerrant Word of the living God. 
Just because it is a God-breathed Scripture ( yga<pr] deojtvevozoe), 
it is authoritative ( avzomozog ) and must therefore be both believed 
and obeyed. Because of its authority we believe the Bible on its 
own account, since it is the unique Book of God in which the 
sovereign Lord speaks to us. This fact we express dogmatically by 
saying that the divine authority of Holy Scripture is absolute, or 
free from dependence upon anything else for its existence'and its 
certainty (auctoritas absoluta). 

The divine authority of Holy Scripture is divided into caus¬ 
ative authority (auctoritas causativa) and normative authority 
(auctoritas normativa). The causative authority of Holy Scripture 
is that by which it engenders and preserves faith in its own teach¬ 
ings through its very word, Bom. 10,17. The normative, or canon¬ 
ical, authority of Holy Scripture is that by which it is the only 
norm and rule of faith, or the divinely instituted arbiter between 
truth and falsehood, John 5, 39; Luke 16, 29; Gal. 1, 8. 

If the question is asked how Scripture exercises its causative 
authority, or how we may become sure of its divine truth, we must 
distinguish between divine assurance (fides divina) and human as¬ 
surance (fides humana). The fides divina (faith assurance, spir¬ 
itual assurance, Christian assurance) is wrought directly by the 
Holy Ghost through the Word (testimonium Spiritus Sancti). In 
other words. Scripture attests itself as the divine truth, John 8, 
31. 32. Of this Quenstedt (I, 97) writes: “The ultimate reason by 
and through which we are led to believe with a divine and unshaken 
faith that God’s Word is God’s Word is the intrinsic power and 
efficacy of that Word itself, or the testimony and seal of the Holy 
Spirit, who speaks in and through Scripture, because the bestow- 
ment of faith ... is a work that emanates from the Holy Spirit.” 
( Doctr . Theol., p. 55.) Of the internal witness of the Holy Ghost, 



122 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


by which divine faith in Scripture is engendered, Hollaz writes 
thus: “By the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit is here 
understood the supernatural act of the Holy Spirit, through the 
Word of God, attentively read or heard, ... by which He moves, 
opens, and illuminates the heart of man and incites it to faithful 
obedience.” (Ibid.) 

That the Word of God, which the Holy Spirit has given to 
us through the prophets and apostles, really possesses causative 
authority, or the power of attesting itself as the divine truth, inde¬ 
pendently of any external proof (fides humana), is clearly taught 
in Holy Scripture. To the Corinthians St. Paul writes that his 
“speech and preaching was in demonstration of the Spirit and 
power,” 1 Cor. 2,4. 5, which means that the preaching of the apostle 
was spiritually effective in working faith and obedience in his 
hearers. To the Thessalonians the same apostle writes that they 
received the Word of God which they heard of him not as the 
word of men, but, as it is in truth, the Word of God, and this 
because the divine Word “effectually worketh in you that believe,” 
1 Thess. 2,13.14. Again to the Corinthians, St. Paul writes that 
his Gospel came unto them not only in word, but also in power and 
in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance, so that they became 
followers of the Lord, 1 Cor. 1, 5. 6. The same causative authority 
as St. Paul ascribes to the divine Word in these passages Christ 
asserts, when He says: “If any man will do His will, he shall 
know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of 
myself,” John 7,17. From John 6, 40 we learn that “to do His 
will” means to hear and believe the divine Word, so that He ascribes 
the working of divine assurance to the divine Word itself. In this 
way, then, and only in this way, do we receive divine assurance of 
the truth of God’s Word: Scripture attests itself as the true Word 
of God through the power of the Holy Ghost, who operates through 
the divine Word. This truth is of great practical importance; for 
whenever doubts arise in the heart of the Christian regarding the 
divine Word, the only way in which to dispel them is to “search the 
Scriptures,” John 5, 39, since they are the divine means by which 
the Holy Spirit enlightens and confirms him in the divine truth, 
1 John 5, 9.10; John 3, 33; 2 Cor. 1, 20—22; Eph. 1,13. 

Against the charge of Roman Catholic theologians that Lu¬ 
theran theology here argues in a circle (argumentum in circtdo, 
idem per idem) we reply that, if Scripture cannot be relied upon 
in its testimony concerning itself, it cannot be relied upon in any 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


123 


other of its teachings. Moreover, the Lutheran argument regard¬ 
ing the causative authority of Scripture is not an argumentum in 
circulo , but rather one from effect to cause (ab effectu ad causam), 
and whoever denies the validity of this reasoning has no other 
choice than agnosticism and atheism. Quenstedt says very rightly 
(1,101): “The papists therefore wrongly accuse us of reasoning 
in a circle when we prove the Holy Scriptures from the testimony 
of the Holy Spirit and the testimony of the Holy Spirit from the 
Holy Scriptures. Else it would also be reasoning in a circle when 
Moses and the prophets testify concerning Christ and Christ con¬ 
cerning Moses and the prophets.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 56.) 

While the fides divina, or spiritual assurance, is the gift of 
the Holy Spirit through the Word (faith engendered through the 
Word by the Holy Ghost), the fides humana, or human assurance, 
is based upon arguments or processes of reason. These arguments 
are either internal or external. The internal proofs for the divine 
authority of Holy Scripture relate to its marvelous style, the 
unique harmony of its parts, the sublime majesty of its subjects, 
its amazing predictions of future events and their remarkable 
fulfilment, the sublimity of its miracles, and the like. The external 
proofs relate to the astounding effects which the Bible has wrought 
wherever it was spread, such as the conversion of men steeped in 
spiritual ignorance and vice, the heroic faith of the martyrs, the 
moral and social improvements which the Gospel has effected, etc. 
As the rational study of the book of nature points to its divine 
Creator, so the rational study of the book of revelation suggests 
that it is the work of a divine Author and that therefore it is more 
reasonable to believe than to disbelieve its claims (the scientific 
proof for the divine authority of Scripture). 

All these arguments are utilized in Christian apologetics to 
demonstrate the futility of infidelity and its atheistic claims. But 
all arguments of reason do not beget “a divine, but merely a human 
faith; not an unshaken certainty, but merely a credibility or a very 
probable opinion” (Quenstedt). Hence the value of these argu¬ 
ments must not be overestimated, for they can never make any 
person a believing child of God. But neither must they be under¬ 
estimated, since they are of great value in refuting the flippant 
charges of infidels and in strengthening Christians against the 
very doubts which from time to time arise in their own hearts. 
Cf. 1 Cor. 15,12—19; Acts 17, 28. Nevertheless, no matter how 
reasonable these arguments may be, they never produce repentance 



124 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


and faith, since the conversion of a sinner is effected alone through 
the preaching of the Word of God, the Law bringing about contri¬ 
tion ( terrores conscientiae , Eom. 3,19. 20) and the Gospel, faith in 
Christ, Matt. 28,19. 20; Acts 2, 37—39; Mark 16,15.16. 

In his ministry the Christian theologian employs arguments of 
reason chiefly to induce unconverted persons to read or hear God’s 
Word, or we may say he uses them just as church-bells, which 
invite men to listen to the proclamation of the divine truth. In no 
case, however, may he employ them as substitutes for the Law and 
the Gospel, or the Word of God, Luke 16,29—31; 24,47. 48. 

If the question is asked how a person may be sure whether his 
assurance is fides divina or fides humana, the following points must 
be considered. The testimony of the Holy Spirit never occurs: 
a. outside, or in opposition to. Holy Scripture (enthusiasm), so that 
the “Christian assurance” or the “Christian experience” of all who 
reject the Bible as the Word of God is mere self-deception; b. by 
means of mere arguments of reason or on the ground of human 
authority (“I believe the Bible because the Church teaches it”); 
c. together with the repudiation of Chrisfs vicarious satisfaction, 
so that the assurance of divine grace which Modernists claim 
(Hitachi, Harnack) is pure fiction. On the other hand, the testi¬ 
mony of the Holy Spirit occurs in all true believers who accept 
Holy Scripture as the Word of God, and that upon its own witness, 
for this very faith in Scripture is the testimonium Spiritus Sancti. 
To this truth all true believers must hold, especially in hours of 
trial, when they do not feel the gladdening effects of the Spirit’s 
witness in them, 1 John 5, 9.10. The very fact that they are be¬ 
lievers proves the effective presence of the Holy Ghost in their 
hearts, for without the Holy Spirit it is impossible to have saving 
faith, 1 Cor. 12, 3; Acts 16,14. 

With regard to the effects of the testimony of the Holy Spirit 
in the believer the Formula of Concord rightly argues that these 
must not be judged ex sensu, or by feeling, since the Holy Ghost is 
always operative in his heart as long as he adheres to God’s Word, 
no matter whether he feels His operation or not. The feeling of 
the Spirit’s operating grace belongs to the fruits of faith in the 
truth of the Gospel and thus to the external witness of the Holy 
Ghost (testimonium Spiritus Sancti externum), while His internal 
witness (testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum) is identical with 
saving faith, or true confidence in the divine promises of the Word. 
In the same vein Luther writes: “We do not distinguish the Holy 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


125 


Spirit from faith, nor is He contrary to faith; for He is Himself 
the assurance in the Word, who makes us certain of the Word, 
so that we do not doubt, but believe most certainly and beyond all 
doubt that it is just so and in no respect whatever different from 
that which God in His Word declares and tells us.” (Erl. Ed., 
58, 153 f.) 

By virtue of its normative or canonical authority, Holy Scrip¬ 
ture is the only norm of faith and life and therefore also the only 
judge in all theological controversies. As the only rule of faith, 
Scripture performs both a directive and a corrective function; for, 
on the one hand, it directs the thoughts of the human mind in 
such a way that they abide within the bounds of truth; and, on 
the other, it corrects errors, inasmuch as it is the only standard of 
right and wrong (Hollaz). Calov says very correctly (1,474): 
“The Holy Scriptures are a rule according to which all contro¬ 
versies in regard to faith or life in the Church should, and can be, 
decided, Ps. 19, 7; Gal. 6,16; Phil. 3,16; and as a norm they are 
not partial, but complete and adequate, because besides the Scrip¬ 
tures no other infallible rule in matters of faith and life can be 
given. All other rules besides the Word of God are fallible; and 
on this account we are referred to the Holy Scriptures as the only 
rule, Deut. 4, 2; 12,28; Josh. 23, 6; Is. 8, 20; Luke 16,29; 
2 Pet. 1, 19, to which alone Christ and the apostles referred as 
a rule, Matt. 4, 4ff.; 22, 29. 31; Mark 9, 12; John 5, 45; Acts 
3, 20; 18, 28; 26, 22.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 61.) 

With regard to the use of Scripture as the norm of faith 
(norma doctrinae, index controversiarum), it must be held that 
not only theologians (2 Tim. 2,2), but also all Christians in gen¬ 
eral should so employ the Word of God (Acts 17,11), since it is 
their duty to supervise the ministry of their teachers (Col. 4,17), 
to avoid all false prophets (Rom. 16, 17; Matt. 7, 15), and to 
spread the pure Gospel of Jesus Christ by personal evangelism 
(Col. 3,16; 1 Pet. 2, 9). The spiritual ability to judge all matters 
of faith and doctrine Holy Scripture ascribes to all believers in 
express words, John 6, 45; 10, 4. 5. 27. Hence whoever denies the 
ability and authority of all Christians to judge questions of Chris¬ 
tian doctrine or life opposes Christ and reveals himself as an anti¬ 
christ. Luther writes very earnestly on this point: “To know and 
to judge matters of doctrine is a privilege which belongs to every 
believer, and every one is anathema who infringes upon this right 
even but a little. For in many incontestable passages of Scripture, 



126 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


Christ has granted this privilege to His Christians, for instance, in 
Matt. 7,15: ‘Beware of false prophets,’ etc. This warning He ad¬ 
dressed to the people in contrast to their teachers, commanding 
them to avoid all false prophets. But how can they avoid them if 
they do not know them? And how can they know them if they 
have no right to judge [their doctrine] ? Yet Christ gave to the 
people not only the right, but also the command to judge, so that 
this one passage suffices against the verdicts of all Popes, fathers, 
church councils, and schools that ascribed the authority to judge 
and pass sentence [upon the teachers of the Church] only to 
bishops and priests, and robbed the people, or the Church, the 
queen, in a most ungodly and sacrilegious manner.” (St. L., 
XIX, 341.) 

On the other hand, however, it must be affirmed that Christians 
must judge doctrinal matters not according to their own thoughts, 
but solely according to Scripture, 1 Pet. 4,11, since in all matters 
of doctrine it alone is the index controversiarum. The objection 
of the papists that Scripture as a “dumb book” is unable to decide 
any matter is in opposition not only to Holy Scripture itself, which 
claims for itself this very authority. Matt. 4, 4ff.; Bom. 3, 19; 
John 7, 51, but also to reason, by which men are prompted to use 
authoritative records to decide issues in controversy (cf. the deci¬ 
sions of the Supreme Court). Every sensible person clearly under¬ 
stands what is meant by such phrases as “The Law decides,” or 
“The Bible decides.” Holy Scripture certainly is more capable of 
deciding questions of controversy than are the papal decretals, to 
which the papists have recourse in determining what to teach. Our 
Lutheran dogmaticians were quite right when they declared: 
“Scripture is never mute except where under the Papacy it is pre¬ 
vented from speaking. (Scriptura Sacra non est muta nisi in pa- 
patu, ubi prohibetur loqui.) 

In what manner controversial questions should be decided by 
the use of Holy Scripture may be stated briefly thus: First deter¬ 
mine the controversial point (status controversiae) and then place 
it in the light of all clear Scripture-passages that treat of the par¬ 
ticular point in question (sedes doctrinae; dicta probantia). In 
this manner Holy Scripture is given an opportunity to exercise its 
judicial function, not indeed by external compulsion (vi externa), 
but by internal persuasion (vi interna). Just so Christ employed 
the Scriptures as a judge in controversy when He said to the 
Pharisees: “There is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


127 


ye trust/’ John 5,45; for here He referred to Moses inasmuch as 
he is speaking in Holy Scripture. 

By adhering to Holy Scripture as the sole source and norm 
of faith, the true visible Church of Christ on earth proves its 
orthodox character; in other words, the orthodox Church of Christ 
on earth is found only where Holy Scripture is obeyed and followed 
in all questions of faith and life. It was for this reason that Luther 
so earnestly emphasized the doctrine of sola Scriptura as the formal 
principle of the Keformation and that to-day the confessional Lu¬ 
theran Church insists upon this doctrine with the same determi¬ 
nation. As soon as a Church, either in theory or in practise, rejects 
the authority of Scripture (Schrijtprinzip), it ceases to be orthodox 
and becomes heterodox, that is to say, an erring Church, or a sect. 

In connection with the normative authority of Holy Scripture 
it must be emphasized that human reason in its magisterial use 
(usus magisterialis) must never be allowed a place beside the Bible. 
In other words, man’s natural knowledge of God, even so far as it 
is correctly retained in his perverted intellect, must never be co¬ 
ordinated with, but always be subordinated to, God’s Word. Unless 
this is done, Scripture is not allowed to stand as the only judge of 
faith. But human reason in its ministerial, or instrumental, sense 
or reason as “the receiving subject or apprehending instrument” 
(Hollaz) must certainly be employed whenever Scripture is used 
as the norm of faith; for “as we see nothing without eyes and 
hear nothing without ears, so we understand nothing without 
reason” (Hollaz). This so-called instrumental use of reason (usus 
organicus; usus instrumentalis) implies both the correct use of 
the laws of human speech (grammar) and of the laws of human 
reasoning (logic), because God, in giving His Word to men, accom¬ 
modated Himself both to the canons of human speech and thought. 
This truth we considered already when we referred to Melanch- 
thon’s dictum: Tkeologia debet esse grammatica, and to Luther’s 
statement that whoever errs in grammar is bound to err also in 
doctrine. 

However, just as human reason in general, so also human logic 
in particular serves the theologian only as a formal discipline (the 
science of correct and accurate thinking) and not as a philosophy 
or a metaphysical system, in which sense the term is sometimes 
used. In addition, even when logic is employed as a formal disci¬ 
pline (the science of reasoning), it must always be kept within 
its legitimate bounds. In other words, the theologian must always 



128 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


be on his guard against fallacies, or against untruths derived from 
the misuse of logic. For example, from the general truth of Scrip-, 
ture "God so loved the world” every person in this world may 
argue: "God so loved me,” since the concept "world” includes 
every human being. In other words, the conclusion attained must 
always be a truth already contained in the premises, or in the 
Scriptural statements, according to the axiom: "Whatever infer¬ 
ences (consequentiae legitimae) are drawn from the declarations 
of Scripture must be proved as being directly expressed in the clear 
words of Scripture. ("Was man aus den Schriftivahrheiten er- 
schliesst , muss als in den Schriftworten ausgedrueckt nachgewiesen 
tverden”) 

On the other hand, when logic is used to propose new doctrines 
not set forth in Scripture, the authority of Scripture (Schrift- 
prinzip) is annulled, and logic is made to serve as a teacher of 
false doctrine. Examples of misapplied logic are the following: 
"Since God has not elected all men, He does not desire to save 
all men.” Or: "Since Peter was saved and Judas was lost, there 
must have been in Peter some cause why he was saved.” Or: 
"Since every body is in space locally, Christ’s body cannot be truly 
present in the Lord’s Supper.” Or: "Since the finite is incapable 
of the infinite, there can be no communication of attributes in the 
person of the God-man.” Or: "As many persons there are, so 
many essences; hence there must be three essences in the God¬ 
head.” Misdirected logic has proved the source of so many errors 
in theology that Gerhard’s warning is well taken (11,371) : "Not 
human reason, but divine revelation is the source of faith; nor are 
we to judge concerning the articles of faith according to the dic¬ 
tates of reason; otherwise we should have no articles of faith, but 
only decisions of reason. The cogitations and utterances of reason 
should be restricted and restrained within the sphere of those things 
which are subject to the decisions of reason and not be extended to 
the sphere of such matters as are placed entirely beyond the reach 
of reason.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 32 f.) 

With respect to the use of Holy Scripture as the only source 
and norm of faith our Lutheran dogmaticians rightly said that it 
is God’s Book designed for all men, Luke 16,29—31; John 5, 39; 
Acts 17,11; even for children, 2 Tim. 3,15; 1 John 2,13. (Finis 
cui Scripturae sunt omnes homines.) For this reason the papal 
injunction against universal Bible-reading is antichristian. How¬ 
ever, it is equally true that all men should use Holy Scripture for 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


129 


obtaining salvation, 2 Tim. 3,15, and not merely for the purpose 
of enriching their knowledge in general or of improving their style. 
(Finis cuius Scripturae Sacrae fides in Christum et solus aeterna 
est.) From this it is clear that it is also the will of God that the 
Bible should be translated into the various languages used in the 
world. (Yersiones Scripturae Sacrae non solum utiles, sed etiam 
necessariae sunt.) The duty of translating the Bible into foreign 
languages is included in Christ’s command to teach all nations, 
Matt. 28, 20. 

While Holy Scripture is the absolute norm of faith (norma 
normans, norma absoluta, norma primaria, norma decisionis), the 
Lutheran Church recognizes its officially received Confessions, or 
Symbols, as secondary norms (noma normata, norma secundum 
quid, norma secundaria, norma discretionis), or as true declara¬ 
tions of the doctrines of Holy Scripture, which all Lutheran theo¬ 
logians must confess and teach. For this reason the confessional 
Lutheran Church demands of all its public teachers and ministers 
a bona-fide subscription to all its Confessions as the pure and un¬ 
adulterated declarations of God’s Word (quia, not quatenus). In 
other words, no public minister is permitted to administer his 
sacred office unless he declares himself convinced that the Lutheran 
Confessions set forth the pure Word of Ood. 

However, while Holy Scripture as the deciding norm (norma 
decisionis) is absolutely necessary, the Confessions as the distin¬ 
guishing norm of the Church (norma discretionis) are only rela¬ 
tively necessary. The former decides which doctrines are true or 
false; the latter, whether a person has clearly understood the true 
doctrines of Scripture. (Norma discretionis discemit orthodoxos 
ah heterodoxis.) 

Although Scripture sufficiently attests itself as the divine 
truth in the believer’s heart, God in His infinite wisdom has pro¬ 
vided that it should be attested also historically. That is to say, by 
proper historical investigation we fully know which books were 
composed by the sacred writers (prophets and apostles), through 
whom God wished to give His Word to the world. This historical 
evidence is of great value, on the one hand, against the papists, 
who by their antichristian decrees elevate human books to the dig¬ 
nity of the divine Scriptures, and, on the other, against unbelieving 
higher critics, who seek to degrade the Holy Scriptures to the level 
of human compositions. In addition, the historical evidence on 
behalf of the authenticity and integrity of the Bible is of value

CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS.

THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


also for believing Christians, since at times the testimony of the 
Holy Spirit in their hearts may be weakened or suppressed entirely 
by doubts. 

For the divine authority of the Old Testament we have the 
express testimony not only of the Jewish Church, but also of our 
omniscient Savior, who without qualification acknowledged the 
Bible that was in use at His time as canonical, Luke 16, 29; 24,44; 
John 6,39; 10,35; Matt. 5,17. Had the Jewish Church erred 
regarding its canon, our divine Lord could not have declared it to 
be “the Scriptures,” John 5,39. The Old Testament Apocrypha 
were received as canonical neither by the Jewish Church nor by 
Christ. The fact that the Roman Catholic Church nevertheless 
elevated them to canonical rank proves its antichristian character. 
For the Scriptures of the New Testament we have Christ’s direct 
statement and promise that both His own and the apostles’ Word 
shall be preserved and acknowledged as the infallible norm of faith 
to the end of time. Matt. 24, 35; John 17, 20; Eph. 2, 20. If the 
divine Word is not recognized as such, the fault rests not with 
Scripture, but with the blindness and perverseness of those who 
decline to believe God’s Word. 

The historical testimony of the canonical books of the New 
Testament has been adequately supplied by the ancient Christian 
Church (ecclesia primitiva). Its acknowledgment of the four 
gospels, the thirteen epistles of Paul, the First Epistle of John, and 
the First Epistle of Peter was unanimous (Homologumena) . With 
regard to the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Second Epistle of Peter, 
the Second and the Third Epistle of John, the Epistle of James, 
the Epistle of Jude, and Revelation, doubts were expressed, so that 
they were classified as Antilegomena. (Cf. Eusebius, Church His¬ 
tory, Bk. III.) Nevertheless, though the canonical character of the 
Antilegomena was questioned by some, each received sufBcient testi¬ 
mony to entitle it to a place in the canon, from which all spurious 
apostolic writings (pseudepigraphs) were rigidly ruled out. In 
case, however, the authority of the Antilegomena as a source and 
norm of faith should be denied to-day (cf. Luther’s verdict on the 
Epistle of St. James), the same doctrines which are set forth in 
them may be sufficiently proved from the Homologumena, since the 
Antilegomena do not contain a single doctrine that is not taught 
in the Homologumena. 

The question whether also the later Christian Church has the

authority to declare certain books to be canonical must be denied 
most emphatically. When the ancient Church differentiated be¬ 
tween Homologumena and Antilegomena, this was a purely histor¬ 
ical procedure, involving nothing more than the question whether 
certain books were written by such and such an apostle of Christ 
or not; but when in the sixteenth century the Council of Trent, 
contrary to the historical judgment of the early Church, declared 
that also the Apocrypha should rank as canonical, it arbitrarily 
added to the fixed canon writings which neither Christ nor His 
holy apostles accepted as such. The later Christian Church cannot 
change or supplement the established canon, because it is not in 
a position to furnish the historical evidence which is required to 
pronounce a certain book canonical or not. The Lutheran dogma- 
tician Chemnitz very correctly called it an antichristian under¬ 
taking to eliminate the distinction between the Homologumena 
and the Antilegomena which the ancient Christian Church has 
established. 

With regard to the manner in which the primitive Church 
proceeded in fixing the Biblical canon, Chemnitz writes {Ex. Trid., 
I, 87): “The testimony of the primitive Church in the times of the 
apostles concerning the genuine writings of the apostles the imme¬ 
diately succeeding generations constantly and faithfully retained 
and preserved, so that, when many others [writings] afterwards 
were brought forward, claiming to have been written by the apostles, 
they were tested and rejected as supposititious and false, first, for 
this reason, that it could not be shown and proved by the testimony 
of the original Church either that they were written by the apostles 
or approved by the living apostles and transmitted and entrusted 
by them to the Church in the beginning; secondly, because they 
proposed strange doctrine not accordant with that which the 
Church received from the apostles and which was at that time still 
preserved in the memory of all.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 85.) 

With regard to the gospels of Mark and Luke and the Acts 
of the Apostles it may be said that the ancient Church placed these 
unanimously and without any qualification among the Homolo¬ 
gumena, though they were not written by apostles. This was done 
on the ground that the two gospels were composed under the super¬ 
vision of St. Peter and St. Paul, respectively, while the Book of 
Acts was accepted as a canonical Scripture fully approved by 
St. Paul. Since the ancient Christian Church has placed these 
writings among the Homologumena, the question concerning their 



132 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


place in the canon ought not to cause any difficulties to-day; at best 
it is only of academic interest. 

The integrity of the New Testament may be assumed a priori, 
since Christ assures us that His Word, as this is set forth in the 
writings of the holy apostles, or in Holy Scripture, John 17, 20; 
Eph. 2, 20; John 8, 31. 32, shall never pass away. Matt. 24, 35. 
The integrity of the Old Testament is guaranteed by Christ’s direct 
and express testimony, John 5, 39. 

With respect to the various versions of the Bible we rightly 
hold that not only the original Hebrew and Greek texts, but also 
the translations of these texts are really and truly God’s Word, 
provided they fully agree with the original reading. On the other 
hand, where translations deviate from the original texts and teach 
anything contrary to them, they must be rejected as not being the 
Word of God. Since translators never write by inspiration of the 
Holy Ghost, but are subject to the common failings of men, all 
Bible versions must be diligently compared with the original text 
to ascertain whether they are correct or not, and for this reason 
the theologian ought to possess an adequate knowledge of Hebrew 
and Greek. 

However, the gap between the original text and its transla¬ 
tions must not be widened unduly, so as to create doubts regarding 
their authority; for the language of Scripture is in most instances 
so direct and simple that any translator who performs his work 
conscientiously is compelled by the clear and direct language of 
Scripture to reproduce the sense of the original. Even the Vulgate 
sets forth the chief truths of the Christian faith with sufficient 
clearness though it is fraught with errors from beginning to end. 
However, the arbitrary promulgation of the Vulgate as the only 
authoritative text by the Roman Catholic Church was an act so 
altogether contrary to the spirit of Christ and His apostles that it 
furnishes additional proof that the papal Church is the Church 
of Antichrist. 

Luther’s methodological advice that the minister, when teaching 
the Catechism, "should above all things avoid the use of different 
texts and forms, but adopt one form and adhere to it, since the 
young and ignorant people will easily become confused if we teach 
thus to-day and otherwise next year, as if we thought of making 
improvements,” applies also to the use of Bible translations in the 
pulpit or wherever else Christian ministers may instruct the com¬ 
mon people.

B. THE DIVINE EFFICACY OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 

(Divlna Efflcacia.) 

Because Holy Scripture is the inspired Word of God, it pos¬ 
sesses not only divine authority, but also divine efficacy, that is to 
say, the creative power to work in man, who by nature is spiritually 
dead, both saving faith and true sanctification. Bom. 10,17: faith; 
1 Pet. 1,23: regeneration; John 17,20: faith and sanctification. 
The Word of God does not merely teach man the way of salvation 
and show him the means by which he may attain it; but by its 
truly divine power (vis vere divina) it actually converts, regen¬ 
erates, and renews him. This unique efficacy is possessed by no 
other book in the world nor by any discourse of man unless these 
repeat God’s Word as set forth in the Bible; for the divine efficacy 
of Scripture is nothing else than God’s power in the Word, Bom. 
1,16. Luther is certainly right when he writes ( Smalcald Art., 
VIII, 3: “We must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace 
to no one except through or with the preceding outward Word.” 
And again ( Large Cat., 101) : “Such is the efficacy of the Word, 
whenever it is seriously contemplated, heard, and used, that it iB 
bound never to be without fruit, but always awakens new under¬ 
standing, pleasure, and devoutness and produces a pure heart and 
pure thoughts. For these words are not inoperative or dead, but 
creative, living words.” 

In opposition to all erroneous doctrine on this point, which 
either denies the divine efficacy of Scripture altogether and ascribes 
to it only a moral direction and instruction (Unitarianism, Pelagi- 
anism) or separates the divine power from the Word (enthusiasm, 
Calvinism), we further describe the divine efficacy as follows: — 

a. The Word of God set forth in Scripture does not operate 
in a natural way, t. e., neither through logical demonstration, ap¬ 
pealing to reason, nor through rhetorical eloquence, appealing to 
the emotions, but in a supernatural manner (efficientia vere divina), 
inasmuch as the Holy Spirit, who is inseparably combined with the 
Word, persuades the human mind of the divine truth through the 
very Word which it contemplates. This is clearly attested by 
St. Paul, who writes: “My speech and my preaching was ... in 
demonstration of the Spirit and of power,” 1 Cor. 2,4. Quenstedt 
says correctly: “It is the innate power and tendency of God’s 
Word always to convince men of its truth.” (Verbum Dei vvrtutem 
exercet per contactum hyperphysicum.) 

b. The divine Word of Holy Scripture has infinite, almighty 



134 


THE DOCTRINE OP HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


power (vis infinita, potentia Dei, omnipotentia), for the same 
almighty power which is essentially in God is by way of communi¬ 
cation (communicative) in His Word. This truth is propounded 
in the following Scripture-passages: Rom. 1, 16. 17: “It is the 
power of God unto salvation”; Eph. 1,19. 20: “Who believe ac¬ 
cording to the working of His mighty power”; 2 Cor. 4, 6: “God, 
who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in 
our hearts [sc., through the Gospel], to give the light of the knowl¬ 
edge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.” Baier writes, 
in full agreement with all these passages: “The same infinite 
virtue which is essentially per se and independently in God and by 
which He enlightens and converts men is communicated to the 
Word.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 605.) 

c. The divine power which inheres in the Word is not irre¬ 
sistible, but resistible (efficacia resistibilis) ; that is to say, the 
saving effects of the Word may be withstood though in itself the 
Word is omnipotent. Matt. 23, 37; 2 Cor. 4, 3. 4. This resistible 
character of the divine Word Quenstedt describes as follows: 
“Accidentally it may be inefficacious, not from any deficiency of 
power, but by the exercise of perverseness, which hinders its opera¬ 
tion, so that its effect is not attained.” This fact is asserted in 
Acts 7,51, where the apostle addresses the hardened Jews thus: 
“Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always 
resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye.” How the 
omnipotent Word of God may be resisted by impotent man is in¬ 
deed unintelligible to human reason; yet for this we have an 
analog in the realm of nature, where natural life, though it owes 
its origin and existence to God's omnipotent power, may be de¬ 
stroyed by man’s feeble hand. Luther's canon of judgment in this 
matter is correct: “When God works through means. He can be 
resisted"; but when He works without means, in His revealed glory 
(in nuda maiestate). He cannot be resisted.” Thus the spiritual 
resurrection, which is effected through the means of grace, Luke 
2,34; Eph. 2,1; Col. 2,12, may be resisted, 1 Cor. 1,23; 2 Cor. 
2,16, while the bodily resurrection, which will be effected by God’s 
sovereign command, cannot be resisted, Matt. 25, 31. 32; John 
11, 24. 

d. The divine power must never be separated from the Word 
of Scripture; that is to say, the Holy Ghost does not operate 
beside or outside the Word (enthusiasm, Calvinism, Rathmannism 
in the Lutheran Church), but always in and through the Word, 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT SCRIPTURE. 


135 


Rom. 10,17; 1 Pet. 1, 23; John 6, 63. This important Scriptural 
truth our Lutheran theologians have always maintained against 
the Reformed (Zwingli: “The Holy Spirit requires no leader or 
vehicle” [dux vel vehiculum ] ; Hodge: “Efficacious grace acts 
immediately”). The practical result of the separation of the divine 
power from the divine Word of Scripture is the rejection of the 
Bible as the only source and norm of faith (norma normans). This 
is proved by the very fact that the enthusiasts have invariably 
placed the “inner word” (verbum internum), or the “spirit,” above 
Holy Scripture (verbum externum), assigning to the latter an in¬ 
ferior place in the realm of divine revelation. To the enthusiasts 
the Bible is only a norma normata, or a rule of faith subject to the 
“inner word,” that is, to their own notions and figments of reason. 
On the other hand, the practical result of the acceptance of the 
Scriptural doctrine that the Holy Spirit is inseparably united 
with the Word is the absolute subjection of every thought to the 
Word of God, as this is set forth in the Bible, 2 Cor. 10, 5. In this 
case every doctrine which is opposed to Scripture is rejected as 
false, no matter to what source it may be attributed, whether it 
be the “spirit,” the “inner word,” the “inner light,” “reason,” 
“science,” “the Church,” “the Pope,” and the like. Unless we 
fully accept the Scriptural doctrine that the Holy Spirit is indis¬ 
solubly united with the Word of Scripture, we cannot regard this 
precious Book of God as the only source and standard of faith. 
It was for this reason that our Lutheran theologians so strenuously 
defended the inseparable unity of the Word and the Spirit. 
Hollaz writes, for example: “The efficacy of the divine Word is 
not only objective or significative, like the statue of Mercury, for 
instance, which points out the path, but does not give the power or 
strength to the traveler to walk in it; but it is effective, because 
it not only shows the way of salvation, but saves souls.” ( Doctr . 
Theol., p. 504.) 

Whenever in our Christian prayers we ask God “to give His 
Spirit and power to the Word,” we do not imply that at times the 
Spirit is absent from the Word with His divine and effective power, 
but we rather confess by these words that our own human efEort 
or skill in applying the Word of God is of no avail whatever, 
1 Cor. 3, 6. Luther in his exposition of Ps. 8, 3, writes on this 
point: “We must put ofE the foolish confidence that we ourselves 
can effect anything through the Word in the hearts of our hearers; 
rather should we diligently continue in the prayer that God alone, 



136 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


without us, would render mighty and active in the hearers the 
Word which He proclaims through preachers and teachers.” (St. L., 
IV, 626.) 

In their controversy with the enthusiasts (Reformed) the Lu¬ 
theran theologians averred that Holy Scripture is efficacious also 
extra usum. By this phrase they meant to say that the Holy Spirit 
is perpetually connected with the Word, so that it retains its power 
even when not in use. This truth had to be maintained also against 
the Lutheran theologian Rathmann, who contended that the “divine 
efficacy is external to the Word.” Against this error the efficacy of 
the Word even when not in use (extra usum) was maintained in 
order that the Word of God might not be reduced to the level of 
human words (cf. Doctr. Theol., p. 507). The statement regard¬ 
ing the efficacy of the Word of God extra usum was thus used to 
emphasize the Scriptural truth that God’s Word is always in itself 
a “power of God unto salvation,” Rom. 1,16. 

Although the Holy Ghost is always active through the Word, 
we must not judge His activity from feeling (ex sensu). The 
Formula of Concord comments on this point: “Concerning the 
presence, operation, and gift of the Holy Ghost we should not and 
cannot always judge ex sensu, as to how and when they are expe¬ 
rienced in the heart; but because they are often covered and occur 
in great weakness, we should be certain from, and according to, 
the promise that the Word of God preached and heard is [truly] 
an office and work of the Holy Ghost, by which He is certainly 
efficacious and works in our hearts, 2 Cor. 2,14ff.; 3, 5if.” (Thor. 
Decl., II, 56.) 

While we ascribe divine efficacy to the entire Word of God as 
set forth in Holy Scripture, we, nevertheless, rightly distinguish 
between the efficacy which is proper to the Law and that which is 
proper to the Gospel. The divine Law has the power to make 
men “guilty before God,” Rom. 3, 19, since “by the Law is the 
knowledge of sin,” Rom. 3, 20. More than this the Law cannot do; 
its sphere is the working of contrition (contritio, terrores con- 
scientiae). The Gospel, on the other hand, works faith and so 
regeneration and conversion, Rom. 10,17; 5,1. However, by this 
very operation it inscribes the divine Law into the heart, Jer. 
31, 31 ff.; that is to say, it makes man willing to obey the Law 
with a cheerful and ready mind, Ps. 110, 3; Rom. 12,1; Gal. 2, 20. 
(Lex praescribit, evangelium inscribit.) Moreover, by this very 
operation it also relieves man from the fear of death and gives him 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


13 T 


power to triumph over this last foe, 1 Cor. 15, 55. Through the 
power of the Gospel the sinner, who by nature is subject to death, 
Heb. 2,15, and without hope in the world, Eph. 2,12, is received 
into Christ’s Kingdom of Grace, John 3,16—18, and finally into 
His Kingdom of Glory, Phil. 1, 3—6; Eph. 1, 16—19; 1 Pet. 
1, 3—5. 

C. THE DIVINE PERFECTION, OK SUFFICIENCY, 

OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 

(Ferfectio Scrlpturae Sacrae.) 

The divine perfection, or sufficiency, of Holy Scripture is that 
property by which it teaches everything that is necessary for sal¬ 
vation. Gerhard defines this property of Scripture as follows 
(II, 286) : “The Scriptures fully and perfectly instruct us con¬ 
cerning all things necessary to salvation.” The Scripture proof 
for this doctrine is clearly set forth in 2 Tim. 3,15—17; John 
17,20; 1 John 1,3.4. Since Holy Scripture is sufficient, or per¬ 
fect, it requires no supplementation either through traditions 
(papists) or new revelations (enthusiasts) or doctrinal progress 
or development (modern rationalistic theologians). The way of 
salvation taught in the Bible is absolutely complete. Matt. 28, 20; 
Mark 16,15. 16. Gerhard, arguing against the Romanists, rightly 
says: “Laying aside tradition, we adhere to Scripture alone.” 

When considering the divine sufficiency of Holy Scripture, we 
must carefully observe the following points: — 

a. Holy Scripture does not contain everything which men may 
know; for with regard to matters of earthly concern it offers very 
little instruction (the Bible is not a “text-book of science”). 
Earthly affairs are treated in Scripture only in so far as they 
pertain to the divine counsel of salvation (the creation of the 
world, etc.). 

b. Holy Scripture does not reveal all divine things which man 
might desire to know; for also in the spiritual sphere its proper 
scope is the saving of sinners, 2 Tim. 3, 16—18; 1 Cor. 13, 12; 
Rom. 11, 33. 

c. Nevertheless, Holy Scripture contains all things “necessary 
to be known for the Christian faith and life and, therefore, for the- 
attainment of eternal salvation” (Quenstedt). All those who deny 
this truth reject the Schriftprinzip, or the basic Christian doctrine 
that Holy Scripture is the only source and norm of faith. The 
papists make of Scripture a restricted norm (norma remissiva) 
and teach a perfectio implicita Scripturae Sacrae; that is to say,. 



138 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


they regard Scripture as sufficient only when its teachings are sup¬ 
plemented by those of the Church, or the Pope. The papists thus 
degrade Scripture to a norma normata. 

Its holy doctrines, Scripture sets forth either in direct words 
(xatd gt]TOv) or according to the sense (xara dtavotav). For the 
first we may cite the express teaching of salvation by grace, through 
faith in Christ, John 3, 16; Rom. 3, 24. 28; for the latter, the 
doctrine of the Holy Trinity, Matt. 28, 20. However, Holy Scrip¬ 
ture never states mere “general principles” from which the Chris¬ 
tian theologian or the Christian Church must “develop” the doc¬ 
trines ; for it is not a book of “general principles,” but of doctrines. 
In order that the theologian may be kept from teaching false doc¬ 
trine, he must constantly bear in mind that he is to teach nothing 
but what Scripture itself teaches in clear words. That is what 
Luther means when he writes: “In the Christian doctrine we must 
not assert anything which Holy Scripture does not teach.” (St. L., 
XIX, 592.) Again: “All Christian articles must be of such 
a nature that they are not only certain to the Christians themselves, 
but also are so confirmed by manifest and clear Scripture-passages 
that they can stop the mouths of all [adversaries], so that they 
can say nothing against them.” (St. L., XVIII, 1747.) 

D. THE DIVINE PERSPICUITY OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 

(Perspicuitas, Claritas Scrlpturae Sacrae.) 

When we say that Holy Scripture is perspicuous, or clear, we 
mean that it sets forth all doctrines of salvation in words so simple 
and plain that they can be understood by all persons of average 
intelligence. The Lutheran dogmatician Baier expresses this 
thought as follows: “Any man acquainted with the language, pos¬ 
sessed of a common judgment, and paying due attention to the 
words may learn the true sense of the words . . . and embrace the 
fundamental doctrines.” The perspicuity of Scripture is definitely 
taught in clear passages: Ps. 119,105.130; 19, 7. 8; 2 Pet. 1,19; 
2 Tim. 3,15. In addition to this, it is presupposed in all those 
passages in which all men are exhorted to search the Scriptures 
for salvation, John 5,39; Luke 16,29; Acts 17,11; 2 Thess. 
2, 15; Is. 34, 16; 1 John 2, 13. 14. Whoever, therefore, rejects 
the perspicuity of the Bible (papists, enthusiasts, modem ration¬ 
alistic theologians) must also reject the basic truth that Scripture 
is the only principium cognoscendi, thus compelling the Christian 
believer to base his faith upon the human expositions either of the 
Church or of individual Bible scholars. 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


139 


Keeping in mind that Holy Scripture is a clear book, the 
Christian exegete must scrupulously refrain from foisting upon its 
sacred text his own subjective views (eisegesis) and regard it as his 
sole function to exhibit the true meaning of God’s clear Word 
(exegesis: the leading forth of the sense of Scripture); in other 
words, he must allow Scripture to interpret itself. (Scriptura 
Scripturam interpretatur; Scriptura sua luce radiat.) Negatively 
the function of the Christian exegete may be described as the re¬ 
moval of all textual difficulties by proper grammatical instruction 
and of all misinterpretations by erring expositors; positively, as 
the exhibition of the true sense of the text (manductio ad nudam 
Scripturam) in the light of its context and parallel passages. 

Hence a true Christian exegete must possess the following 
qualifications: a) He must regard the whole Bible as the in- 
errant Word of God; b) he must treat Holy Scripture as a book 
which is clear in itself; c) he must conscientiously point out 
the real sense of the text; and d) he must be able to refute the 
erroneous human opinions which false teachers or misguided or¬ 
thodox theologians have foisted upon the text. 

With regard to the perspicuity of Holy Scripture we may 
yet observe the following points: — 

a. Holy Scripture is preeminently clear with respect to those 
things that are necessary for salvation. We readily admit that 
Scripture contains passages which are more or less obscure not 
only to the average Christian, but also the Christian theologian. 
But this fact does not disprove the doctrine of the perspicuity of 
the Bible. The passages which in themselves are obscure do not 
set forth fundamental articles of the Christian faith, but per¬ 
tain, as our dogmaticians have said, commonly to “onomastic, 
chronological, topographical, allegorical, typical, or prophetical 
matters” (Quenstedt). Of the passages which propound doctrines 
some are less clear than others or, as Gerhard remarks: “What is 
obscurely expressed in one passage is more clearly explained in 
others,” and in all such cases the more obscure must be intepreted 
in the light of the clear (sedes doctrinae; analogia fidei). But 
also this fact does not disprove the doctrine of Biblical perspicuity. 
In his exposition on Ps. 37 Luther comments very aptly: “But if 
any one of them (the papists) should trouble you and say: ‘You 
must have the interpretation of the Fathers, since Scripture is 
obscure/ then you must reply: ‘It is not true. There is no clearer 
book upon earth than is Holy Writ, which in comparison with all 



140 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY SCRIPTURE. 


other books is like the sun in its relation to all other lights.’ They 
say such things only because they want to lead us away from Scrip¬ 
ture and elevate themselves to the position of masters over us in 
order that we might believe their dream sermons. . . . For that is 
indeed true: Some passages in Scripture are obscure, but in these 
you find nothing but what is found in other places and in clear and 
plain passages. Then came the heretics and explained the obscure 
passages according to their own reasonings, and with these they 
combated the clear passages and foundation of faith. So the 
Fathers fought them with the clear passages, and with them they 
shed light upon the obscure, proving in this way that what is said 
obscurely in some passages is set forth clearly in others. Do not 
permit yourselves to be led out of, and away from. Scripture, no 
matter how hard they [the papists] may try. For if you step out 
of Scripture, you are lost; then they will lead you just as they 
wish. But if you remain in Scripture, you have won the victory 
and you will regard their raging in no other way than when the 
crag of the sea smiles at the waves and billows. All their writings 
are nothing else than waves that rock to and fro. Be assured and 
certain that there is nothing clearer than the sun, I mean, Holy 
Scripture. If a cloud drifts before it, nothing else than the same 
clear sun is nevertheless behind it. If then you find an obscure 
passage in Scripture, do not be alarmed, for surely the same 
truth is set forth in it which in another place is taught plainly. 
So if you cannot understand the obscure, then cling to the clear.” 
(St. L., V, 334ff.) These defiant statements of Luther reecho 
the clear truths which Holy Scripture itself teaches concerning 
its perspicuity, Ps. 119, 105; 2 Pet. 1, 19f. (Cf. also Luther’s 
defense of the perspicuity of Scripture in his famous work Be 
Servo Arbitrio. St. L., XVIII, 1681 ff.) 

b. The perspicuity of Scripture must not be identified with 
comprehensibility of its mysteries of faith (perspicuitas rerum). 
The very doctrines which we must believe for our salvation, for 
instance, the incarnation of Christ, the Holy Trinity, the per¬ 
sonal union of the two natures in Christ, the atonement through 
Christ’s vicarious suffering and death, etc., will always remain 
unintelligible to human reason (res inevidentes). But these in¬ 
comprehensible mysteries of our faith are set forth in words so 
intelligible (perspicuitas verborum) that every person of ordinary 
intelligence who understands human speech can receive them into 
his mind (apprehensio simplex) and through the supernatural 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT SCRIPTURE. 


141 


operation of the Holy Ghost can apprehend them also spiritually 
(apprehensio spiritucUis sive practica). For this reason our Lu¬ 
theran dogmaticians have called the perspicuity of Scripture 
a claritas verborum, or claritas externa, or claritas grammatica, etc. 
Gn this point Gerhard quotes Luther (I, 26), who writes: “If you 
speak of the internal clearness, no man understands a single iota 
in the Scriptures by the natural powers of his mind unless he has 
the Spirit of God; for all men [by nature] have obscure hearts. 
The Holy Spirit is required for the understanding of the whole of 
Scripture and of all its parts. If you refer to the external clear¬ 
ness of Scripture, there is nothing that is left obscure or am¬ 
biguous, but all things brought to light in the Word are per¬ 
fectly clear.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 73.) The whole doctrine of the 
•clearness of Scripture may be summed up as follows: Scripture 
is clear externally (claritas verborum) to all men of sound minds, 
internally (claritas spiritualis) only to believers, and essentially 
(claritas rerum, the understanding of the mysteries of the faith) 
■only to the saints in heaven, 1 Cor. 13,12. 

From all this it is obvious to whom Holy Scripture must 
remain an obscure book, namely, to all — 

a. Who understand neither human speech in general nor 
Scriptural speech in particular; 

b. Who are so filled with prejudice that they refuse to give 
the words of Scripture honest consideration; 

c. Who foolishly endeavor to comprehend the divine mysteries 
by means of their blind reason; 

d. Who are filled with enmity against the divine truths which 
Scripture teaches, Ps. 18, 26; John 8, 43—47; 2 Cor. 4, 3. 4. This 
explains why so many errorists arrogantly reject Holy Scripture as 
an obscure book. “Blind unbelief is sure to err and scan His work 
in vain.” (Cowper.) 

“Blind unbelief 5 ’ has also suggested the objections which have 
been preferred against the perspicuity of Holy Scripture. Among 
these we may note the following: — 

a. The institution of the holy ministry . Answer: Christ did 
indeed institute the public ministry, not, however, to render the 
Bible clear, but to preach the Gospel, which the Bible propounds 
so clearly, Mark 16,15.16; Matt. 28,19. 20, and by this means to 
guide men to heaven, Heb. 13,17; Ezek. 3,18. 

b. The dissensions and factions within the visible Christian

THE DOCTRINE OP HOLT SCRIPTURE. 


Church. Answer: These, alas! exist, but only because men insist 
on rejecting the clear doctrines of Scripture, John 8, 31. 32; 
1 Tim. 6, 3 f. 

c. Obscure passages occur in Scripture. Answer: Such pas¬ 
sages do not disprove the perspicuity of Scripture since the doc¬ 
trines of salvation are taught with great clarity. St. Augustine 
rightly says: “In the clear passages of Scripture everything is 
found that is necessary for faith and life.” 

d. The unintelligible mysteries of the faith. Answer: These 
mysteries are indeed beyond the grasp of human reason, but they 
are taught in language so plain that it is intelligible even to 
a normal child. 

e. Special passages of Scripture allegedly admit its obscurity. 
Passages such as 2 Pet. 3,16 and 1 Cor. 13,12 have been pointed 
out by those who deny the perspicuity of Scripture. Answer: 
St. Peter declares that among the things which St. Paul writes in 
his epistles ( lv alg) there are some that are hard to be understood 
(dvovdrjxa). Holy Scripture indeed contains many things which 
admittedly are “hard to be understood.” However, this does not 
disprove its perspicuity; for wherever it teaches the way of sal¬ 
vation, it is perfectly clear. 

In 1 Cor. 13,12 St. Paul does not speak of Holy Scripture, 
but of our knowledge of God and divine truth, which now is me¬ 
diate and imperfect, but which in heaven will be immediate and 
perfect. Hence also this passage does not disprove the perspicuity 
of Scripture. 

The perspicuity of Scripture is denied both by the papists 
(“The Scriptures are not of themselves clear and intelligible even 
in matters of the highest importance.” Cardinal Gibbons, The 
Faith of Our Fathers, p. Ill) and the enthusiasts. The papists 
claim that the Scriptures must be interpreted by the Church, or 
the Pope, while the enthusiasts assert that they must be expounded 
by means of the “inner light.” In the last analysis both papists 
and enthusiasts resort to human reason to expound Scripture, 
just as modern rationalists do, who aver that the Bible must be 
interpreted in the light of modern intelligence. In all three 
cases the charge against God’s holy and clear Book of salvation 
is prompted by deliberate opposition to the blessed Gospel of 
Christ, 1 Cor. 1, 22. 23. 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


143 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 

(De Deo.) 


1. THE NATURAL KNOWLEDGE OF GOD. 

(Notitia Dei Naturalis.) 


Whatever man knows of God he knows through God’s own 
revelation of Himself either in the realm of nature or in the realm 
of grace, that is to say, either through God’s work of creation and 
providence or through His holy Book, the Bible. Hence we rightly 
speak of a natural knowledge of God and of a supernatural or 
revealed (Christian) knowledge of God. Had God not revealed 
Himself, man never would have known Him, since God is the 
absolute, perfect Personality, who dwells “in the light which no 
man can approach unto,” 1 Tim. 6,16. 

By means of his natural knowledge of God, man knows that 
there is a personal, eternal, omnipotent Divine Being, who has 
created this world and still preserves and rules all things and who 
is holy and just, demanding what is good and punishing what is 
evil. This natural knowledge of God is mediated to man — 

a. By God's created works (nonj/uara fteov, creaturae Dei), 
which in themselves bear witness to their omnipotent Creator. In 
Rom. 1, 20 St. Paul attests that, though God Himself is invisible, 
man nevertheless knows of Him and, in particular, of His person¬ 
ality, eternity, omnipotence, and sovereignty “by the things that 
are made.” That this is true is proved by the testimony of many 
heathen philosophers, as, for example, by Aristotle and Cicero. 
Cicero writes ( Tuscul . Disput., I, 28): “Deum non vides; tamen 
Deus agnoscis ex operibus eius.” This natural knowledge of God 
is so certain that the apostle says of all agnostics and atheists, 
who deny His divine existence and commands, that “they are with¬ 
out excuse.” (The cosmological proof of God’s existence.) 

b. By God's continued operation in the realm of nature and 
of human history. In Acts 14,15—17 St. Paul asserts that God 
“left not Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave 
rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food 
and gladness.” The knowledge which man gains from God’s con¬ 
tinued self-manifestation in human history is described by the 
apostle in Acts 17, 26—28, where he declares that God has made 
and governs all men in such a manner “that they should seek the 
Lord” and that “in Him we live and move and have our being” in 



144 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


such a way that even the heathen poets have professed: “We are 
also His offspring.” (The historical proof of God’s existence.) 

c. By the divine Law written in the heart of man. By means 
of this Law, men “know the judgment of God,” Rom. 1, 32, and 
without the revealed Law “do by nature the things contained in 
the Law,” “their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts 
the mean while accusing or else excusing one another,” Rom. 2, 
14.15. (The moral proof of God’s existence.) 

In view of these facts the antitheistic theories held by men 
are not the results of sound reasoning, but rather the effects of 
man’s perverse, wilful suppression of the natural knowledge of God, 
which He has implanted into the human heart, Rom. 1,18. They 
do not represent progress in human religious thought, but rather 
spiritual and moral decadence. 

Atheism denies God’s existence, although by nature man has 
a distinct knowledge of God, Rom. 1,19; Ps. 14,1. Polytheism 
divides God into many divine entities, although the knowledge 
which man by nature has of God is monotheistic (Rom. 1,20: “His 
eternal power”). Hylozoism endues matter with life and denies 
that God is the extramundane and supramundane Ruler and Judge 
of men, though by nature man knows “the judgment of God,” 
Rom. 1, 32. Materialism denies the reality of spirit and ignores 
the distinction between matter and mind, so that there is in mate¬ 
rialism no God and no human soul and no immortality, but only 
persistence of matter and force. Pantheism is the doctrine that 
God is all and all is God, so that nothing exists outside of God. 
Deism admits that there is a personal God, who has created the 
world and has impressed upon it the laws that govern it, but it 
teaches that after this, God withdrew from the world and left it 
to the reign of natural laws. Pessimism regards the world and life 
as essentially evil and holds that the world, if not the worst that 
it can be, is at least sufficiently evil to be worse than none at all. 
Atheistic evolution denies the existence of God, asserts the eternity 
of matter and force, and attributes the development of the cosmos 
to purely natural forces (Keyser). Theistic evolution holds that 
God created the primordial material and that evolution has since 
been His modus operandi in developing it to its present status. 
Agnosticism maintains that we cannot know whether there is a God 
or not. Positivism teaches that we can know only phenomena, but 
not noumena, or the essence of things. Hence it is agnostic in 
regard to God, the soul, and the substance of things. 

All these anti-Biblical theories are in opposition to the natural 



THE DOCTRINE OF OOD. 


145 


knowledge of God which Holy Scripture very clearly and emphati¬ 
cally ascribes to man, Rom. 1, 19. 20. 32; 2,14.15. 

The natural knowledge of God is true as far as it goes, Rom. 
1,18, for what it teaches of God’s personality, eternity, omnipo¬ 
tence, sovereignty, holiness, and righteousness agrees with revealed 
religion. Innate (notitia innata) though it is (Rom. 2,14.15: 
“A law unto themselves”; “the work of the Law written in their 
hearts”), it can nevertheless be expanded and further confirmed 
(notitia acquisita) by the contemplation of the works and ways of 
God in nature and history. Acts 17, 27. 28, though it may also be 
corrupted and changed into error (antitheistic theories) through 
the moral depravity existing in man, Rom. 1,18. 

The natural knowledge of God is of great benefit to man be¬ 
cause it is the foundation of the civil righteousness (iustitia civilis), 
Rom. 2,14; Acts 17, 27, of natural man, and the starting-point for 
the proclamation of the revealed Law by Christian missionaries. 
Luther rightly declares that, had God not written the Law into 
man’s heart, we would have to preach a long time before man’s 
conscience would be smitten. (St. L., Ill, 1053.) When St. Paul 
preached the Word of God to the Athenian philosophers, he began 
by appealing to their natural knowledge of God, Acts 17, 23—29. 

The natural knowledge of God is of great value also because 
upon the basis of it man constructs the so-called rational proofs for 
God’s existence to combat unbelief. Thus the ontological proof 
argues from the existence of the idea of God in man to the actuality 
of Ilis existence. The cosmological proof concludes that the world 
must have a First Cause back of all the secondary causes that are 
operative in nature. The teleological proof argues from the design 
and purpose which are everywhere evident in nature. The moral 
proof argues from the existence of our moral constitution to the 
existence of a Supreme Moral Being. The historical proof draws 
from the history of man the conclusion that there is a divine Ruler 
who guides all affairs of the world to an end which He has in view. 
The theological proof argues God’s existence from the fact that the 
idea of God need never be explained to men, since all men in the 
world know who is meant by that term. Hence the natural knowl¬ 
edge of God must not be underestimated, since God has bestowed 
it upon man to govern him in His Kingdom of Power (in regno 
potentiae), holds him accountable for his attitude toward it, Rom. 
1,18—32, and rewards his respecting and obeying it with temporal 
blessings, Ex. 1, 20. 21. 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS.

146 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


In spite of all this, however, the natural knowledge of God is 
not sufficient to secure man’s salvation. Quenstedt writes on this 
point (I, 261): “The natural knowledge of God is not adequate to 
secure everlasting life, nor has any mortal ever been redeemed, nor 
can any one ever be redeemed, by it alone,” Acts 4, 12; Rom. 
10,17; Mark 16,15.16; Gal. 3,11; Eph.4,18; 2,12; Gal. 4, 8. 
( Doctr. Theol., p. 110.) Since the natural knowledge of God does 
not embrace the Gospel, 1 Cor. 2, 7—10, but only the Law, Rom. 2, 
14.15, its practical result is nothing more than a guilty conscience, 
Rom. 1, 20; 2, 15, fear of death, Heb. 2, 15, the state of con¬ 
demnation, Gal. 3,10, and utter hopelessness, Eph. 2,12. Man by 
nature knows that there is a just and holy God, Rom. 1, 21, but not 
that the eternal demands of His perfect justice have been satisfied 
by the vicarious satisfaction of Christ, 1 Cor. 1, 21. In addition, 
while man by nature knows that there is a God, he does not know 
who this true God is, 1 Cor. 1, 21; Acts 17, 24. 25; Matt. 
28, 19. 20. 

While man’s natural knowledge of God coincides in some 
points with the supernatural, or revealed, knowledge of God 
(articuli mixti), the Christian theologian bases all that he teaches 
of God alone on Holy Scripture, because this is the only divinely 
appointed source and norm of faith (principium cognoscendi). 
It alone teaches the precious Gospel-truths of God, by which man 
is saved (articuli puri). The Lutheran dogmatician Chemnitz 
writes of this ( Loci Theol., I, 22) : “The saving knowledge of God, 
through which we obtain eternal life, is that revealed through the 
Word, in which God makes known Himself and His will. To this 
revelation God has bound His Church, which knows, worships, and 
glorifies God only as He has revealed Himself in this Word, so that 
in this way the true and only Church of God may be distinguished 
from all heathen religions.” (Doctr. Theol., p. 111.) 

The Christian knowledge of God, which we obtain from Holy 
Scripture, and from no other source, is not only theistic, but also 
Trinitarian; that is, the Christian believer knows and worships 
God only as the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three 
distinct persons in one inseparable essence. This Christian knowl¬ 
edge of God is not a mere supplement to man’s natural knowledge 
of God, but an entirely new revelation, by which man is enabled to 
know God truly and fully, Matt. 28,19. 20; 1 Cor. 8, 4—6, and to 
worship Him by true faith as his Savior, Is. 41, 14; 42, 5—8; 
43,1—3.10—12; 44,1—8; 45,20—25. 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


147 


For this reason every Christian description of God must in¬ 
corporate also the Holy Trinity; that is to say, whenever a Chris¬ 
tian theologian describes God, he must describe Him as the one 
God who is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Calov is right when 
he says (II, 282): “Those who do not include a statement of the 
three Persons in the description of God do not present that doc¬ 
trine in a form at all genuine or complete, since without these it 
does not yet appear who the true God is.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 117.) 

2. THE HOLY TRINITY. 

According to Holy Scripture, God is one in essence, but in 
this one essence there are three distinct Persons, Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost. This is the Christian doctrine of God. (Luther: 
Scriptura Sancta docet esse Deum simplicissime unum et tres, ut 
vocant, personas verissime distinctas.” (St. L., X, 176f.) This 
doctrine of Scripture the Christian Church expresses by the term 
“Trinity.” 

That God is one in essence, though three in person. Holy 
Scripture teaches distinctly; its doctrine of God in both the Old 
and the New Testament is exclusively monotheistic. According to 
Scripture, God is one, and besides this one God there is no God. 
(Deut. 6, 4: “Hear, 0 Israel: the Lord, our God, is one Lord”; 
1 Cor. 8, 4: “There is none other God but one.”) All idols of the 
heathen Holy Scripture designates as “non-gods,” Jer. 2, 11; 
“vanities,” dW>K. Lev. 19, 4, or as things which are wholly without 
real existence. Cp. the descriptions of idols in Is. 44, 6—20; Jer. 2, 
26—28; P8. 115, 1—9; 135,15—17. In the New Testament 
St. Paul writes with equal emphasis: “An idol is nothing in the 
world,” 1 Cor. 8, 4, and from this he draws the basic Christian doc¬ 
trine : “But to us there is but one God,” 1 Cor. 8, 6. 

With the paramount truth of God’s existence Holy Scripture 
immediately connects the demand of divine adoration. The one 
true God, who has revealed Himself in His Word, must be adored 
and served by all men. (Ex. 20, 3: “Thou shalt have no other 
gods before me”; Mark 12, 29. 30: “And Jesus answered him, The 
first of all the commandments is, Hear, 0 Israel: The Lord, our 
God, is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all 
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with 
all thy strength.”) As polytheism eliminates the very concept of 
God, so also it destroys true worship. Hence, if the heathen would 
worship God, they must turn from their idols to the true God. 



148 


THE DOCTBINE OF GOD. 


(Acts 14, 15: “Ye should turn from these vanities, dno xovxcov 
xcbv fxaxalcov, unto the living God.”) 

However, while Holy Scripture most earnestly inculcates the 
doctrine of God’s unity, it teaches at the same time that the one 
God is the Holy Trinity. When Christ sent forth His disciples to 
teach all nations, He expressly commanded them to baptize “in 
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,” 
Matt. 28,19. However, “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost” are desig¬ 
nations of three persons; hence the Christian Church teaches, on 
the basis of Scripture: “God is one, and yet in the one divine 
essence are three distinct persons.” (“Father, Son, and Holy 
Ghost, three distinct persons in one divine essence and nature, are 
one God, who has created heaven and earth,” Smalcald Art., First 
Part.) As Holy Scripture connects with the doctrine of the unity 
of God the demand that this one God must be worshiped, so also 
it demands that the one true God should be adored as the Holy 
Trinity. In other words, not one Person of the Godhead should be 
worshiped, but all three. (1 John 2,23: “Whosoever denieth the 
Son, the same hath not the Father”; 5,12: “He that hath not the 
Son hath not life”; John 5, 23: “All men should honor the Son 
even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son 
honoreth not the Father which hath sent Him.”) On the basis of 
this clear doctrine of Scripture the Apology of the Augsburg Con¬ 
fession affirms (Art. I) : “We declare that we believe and teach 
that there is one divine essence, undivided, etc., and yet, that there 
are three distinct persons, of the same divine essence and coeternal, 
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. This article we have always taught 
and defended, and we believe that it has, in Holy Scripture, sure 
and firm testimonies that cannot be overthrown. And we con¬ 
stantly affirm that those thinking otherwise are outside the Church 
of Christ and are idolaters and insult God.” 

In order that we may hold to the pure Scriptural doctrine 
concerning the Holy Trinity, we must maintain, on the basis of 
Scripture, that each Person in the Godhead is the entire God (totus 
Deus), or that each Person has the whole divine essence without 
division or multiplication (sine divisione et multiplicatione) . “Of 
these Persons each one is the whole God, besides whom there is no 
other God.” Luther. By the expression sine divisione we mean to 
say that the divine essence with its attributes is not divided among 
the three Persons, so that the Father has one-third, the Son one- 
third, and the Holy Ghost one-third, but that each Person has the 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


149 


whole divine essence entire and undivided. This is not a “dog¬ 
matical construction,” but Scriptural doctrine. Col. 2, 3: “In 
whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”; 2, 9: 
“In Him [Christ] dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” 
By the expression sine multiplications we declare that there are 
not three distinct sets, or series, of divine attributes, so that the 
Father has one set, the Son another, and the Holy Ghost a third, 
but that the one and same essence with all its divine attributes 
belongs to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, according to 
number (numero, secundum numerum), not merely according to 
kind (specie). Of men it must be said that there are as many 
essences as there are persons (quot personae, tot essentiae), but of 
God, Holy Scripture testifies that the three Persons of the Godhead 
have one and the same essence with all its attributes numerically. 
Tres personae, una essentia divina, individua, unus Deus. This 
sublime truth Holy Scripture teaches in the following passages: 
John 10, 30: “I and My Father are one (&»)”; John 5,17: “My 
Father worketh hitherto, and I work”; 5,19: “The Son can do 
nothing of Himself but what He seeth the Father do; for what 
things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise”; 10, 37: 
“If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not.” This truth 
the Creed of Athanasius professes as follows: “We worship one 
God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the 
Persons nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of 
the Father; another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. 
But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost 
is all one: the glory equal, the majesty coeternal. Such as the 
Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. ... So like¬ 
wise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Ghost 
almighty. And yet they are not three Almighties, but one Al¬ 
mighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy 
Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods, but one God. . . . 
And in this Trinity none is before or after other; none is 
greater or less than another; but the whole three Persons are 
coeternal together and coequal: so that in all things, as is afore¬ 
said, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be wor¬ 
shiped.” (Triglot, p. 33.) 

The Scriptural doctrine of the Holy Trinity is absolutely in¬ 
comprehensible to the human mind; for on the basis of Scripture 
we profess one undivided and indivisible God, so that each Person 
is the entire God (totus Deus); and yet three really distinct Per-

sons, so that, when the Son became incarnate, He alone became 
man and not the Father or the Holy Ghost, and when the Son 
suffered and died, He alone suffered and died and not the Father 
or the Holy Ghost. This truth is beyond reason, for according to 
reason the Unity annuls the Trinity and the Trinity the Unity. 
In other words, human reason must assume either one God or three 
Gods. It cannot reconcile Unity with Trinity nor Trinity with 
Unity. Consequently all errorists on this point have denied either 
the Unity or the Trinity.

IN CONTROVERSY.

i 


The Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity has been strenu¬ 
ously controverted, on the one hand, by errorists who denied the 
three Persons (Monarchians, Unitarians, Antitrinitarians) and, on 
the other, by errorists who denied the one essence (Tritheites). 
The Monarchians may be divided into two classes: the Modalistic 
Monarchians, or Patripassians, known in the East as Sabellians, 
who held that the three Persons of the Trinity are but three dif¬ 
ferent energies or modes of the same divine person, so that the Son 
and the Holy Ghost are but different manifestations (ngdocona) 
of the Father; and the Dynamic Monarchians, or Adoptionists, 
who held that the Son was a mere man and the Holy Ghost the 
Father's divine energy in the creatures (Paul of Samosata, Pho- 
tinians, Arians, Socinians, Unitarians, Modernists). In opposition 
to Monarchianism, which denies the three distinct Persons, the 
Christian Church holds that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not 
three modes or energies of one person, but three distinct persons, 
or individuals. This truth is proved a) by the very terms Father, 
Son, and Holy Ghost, which never designate qualities or energies 
inhering in a person, but always Persons subsisting of them¬ 
selves. ( Augsb. Conf., Art. I: “And the term person they use as 
the Fathers have used it, to signify not a part or quality in another, 
but that which subsists of itself.”) This truth is also proved b) by 
the personal works of the individual Persons, such as speaking, will¬ 
ing, reproving, etc., which Scripture ascribes not only to the Father, 
but also to the Son and to the Holy Ghost. (Actiones semper sunt 
suppositorum intelligentium, . . . opera sunt personis propria.) 
To the Son Scripture ascribes the acts of knowing, Matt. 11, 27, of 
declaring, John 1,18, of willing, John 17, 24, etc.; to the Holy 
Ghost it ascribes the acts of speaking, Acts 28, 25, of teaching, 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


151 


John 14, 26, of reproving, John 16, 8, etc. This truth is further¬ 
more proved c) by express passages of Scripture in which the 
Father is called another (Silo?) than the Son, John 5, 32. 37, or in 
which the Holy Ghost is called another (5IIoc) than the Son, 
John 14,16. 

As the Monarchians deny the three Persons of the Godhead, 
so other errorists deny the unity of God and teach three distinct 
divine essences in place of the one undivided and indivisible divine 
essence. Of these errorists the Tritheites coordinate the three es¬ 
sences, while the Subordinationists subordinate them, ascribing to 
the Father priority of essence. All Subordinationists deny the one 
true God and teach polytheism; for since they affirm that the Son 
and the Holy Ghost are “God in a lesser degree” than is the Father, 
they assume three distinct divine essences, or three gods, of whom 
one is the supreme Lord, while the others are inferior deities. In 
opposition to this error the Christian Church teaches that the three 
Persons in the one Godhead are fully coordinate, that is, that they 
are God in the same manner and the same degree, because the 
divine essence, which is numerically one (una numero divina es¬ 
sentia), belongs to each Person entire and undivided. This doc¬ 
trine rests upon clear and decisive Scripture-passages. In Matt. 
28,19 three distinct and entirely coordinate Persons are described 
as having the same name ( ovo/ua ). Again, to the Son and to the 
Holy Ghost are ascribed a) the same divine names as to the Father, 
including the nomen essentiale et incommunicabile nirp (the Son: 
Jer. 23, 6; John 1,1; the Holy Ghost: 2 Sam. 23, 2; Acts 5, 3. 4) ; 

b) the same divine attributes, such as eternity, omnipotence, omnis¬ 
cience, omnipresence, goodness, mercy, etc. (the Son: Col. 1,17; 
John 10,28; John 21,19; Matt.28,20; 2 Cor. 13,14; the Holy 
Ghost: Heb. 9, 14; Is. 11, 2; 1 Cor. 2, 10—12; Ps. 139, 7); 

c) the same divine works, such as creation, preservation, mir¬ 
acles, etc. (the Son : John 1,1—3; Col. 1,16; John 5,17; 6, 39; 
the Holy Ghost: Ps. 33,6; Job 33,4; Acts 10,38); d) divine 
adoration and worship (the Son: John 5, 23; Phil. 2,10; the Holy 
Ghost: Is. 6, 3; 2 Cor. 13,14; Num. 6, 26). Thus the true deity 
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is strenuously affirmed in 
Scripture. 

Hence whenever the Father is called the First, the Son the 
Second, and the Holy Ghost the Third Person of the Godhead, 
this does not denote any subordination or any inequality in respect 
to time (tempore) or dignity (natura vel dignitate), but merely in-

THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


dicates the Scriptural truth that the Son is from the Father, John 
1,14, and the Holy Ghost from the Father and Son, Matt. 10, 20; 
Gal. 4, 6. Or we may say this order of enumeration shows the 
divine mode in which the Three Persons subsist in the Godhead 
(modus subsistendi). But that the Son was generated from the 
Father does not render Him inferior to the Father, nor does the 
spiration of the Holy Ghost render the Spirit inferior to the Father 
and the Son, because the divine generation and spiration are 
eternal acts, or timeless processes, by which the Son and the Holy 
Ghost, together with the Father, possess the same divine essence 
and majesty. The Creed of Athanasius declares: “In this Trinity 
none is before or after other; none is greater or less than an¬ 
other; but the whole three Persons are coeternal together, and 
coequal: so that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity, 
and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshiped.” When Christ says 
of Himself: “The Father is greater than I,” John 14, 28, He 
speaks of Himself according to His human nature in His state of 
humiliation. Athanasius: Aequalis Patri secundum divinitatem, 
minor Patre secundum humanitatem. The fact that the Father 
was “greater” than the Son in the latter's state of humiliation 
ceased when Christ was exalted, John 14, 28; Eph. 1, 20—23; 
Phil. 2, 9—11. 

Again, when Scripture says that God created the world by 
the Son, Heb. 1, 2; John 1, 3, it teaches by no means any subordi¬ 
nation of the Son to the Father, but rather the divine mode of 
operation (modus operandi) ad extra. For as the Son is of the 
Father, so also His operation is from the Father, while that of the 
Holy Ghost is from the Father and the Son. Nevertheless, the 
divine operation remains one according to number (una numero 
potentia) and belongs to each Person entire, so that it is not dis¬ 
tributed among the Three Persons. For this reason Holy Scrip¬ 
ture sometimes ascribes the whole work of creation to one single 
Person without naming the others. (Creation ascribed to the Son 
John 1,1—3; Heb. 1,10.) Gerhard writes (IV, 4): “But that 
one true God is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; therefore in Scrip¬ 
ture the work of creation is ascribed to the Father and to the Son 
and to the Holy Ghost. Of the Father it is affirmed 1 Cor. 8, 6; of 
the Son, John 1, 3; Col. 1, 16; of the Holy Ghost, Job 26, 13; 
33,4; Ps. 104,30. We conclude therefore that creation is an un¬ 
divided action of the one and true God alone, namely, of the 
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 162.) And

Hollaz writes: “In Holy Scripture and the Apostles’ Creed the 
work of creation is ascribed in a peculiar manner to God the Father 
a) because of the order of working: for this reason that what the 
Father has of Himself to do and to create the Son of God and the 
Holy Ghost have of the Father; b) because in the work of crea¬ 
tion God the Father by His most efficacious word of command 
manifested His own omnipotence, Gen. 1, 3; c) because creation is 
the first work ad extra and therefore, by appropriation, is affirmed 
of the First Person of the Godhead.” (Ilid.) 

4. THE DOCTRINE OF THE HOLY TRINITY AND THE 
TERMINOLOGY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 

The question has been debated whether such terms as are not 
found in Scripture may be used when a doctrine of the Christian 
religion is presented or taught, e. g., the doctrine of the Holy 
Trinity. In reply to this question we say that all terms which ex¬ 
press the clear doctrine of God as revealed in Scripture should be 
used without fear, especially those in which the Christian Church 
defends the divine truth against error. Furthermore, it must be 
affirmed that all who believe as the Church does should also speak 
as the Church. Those who needlessly or frivously invent new 
terms not only confuse the Church by new and unaccustomed ex¬ 
pressions, but also expose themselves to the suspicion that they seek 
their own glory and endeavor to introduce new and erroneous doc¬ 
trines. Hence the use of new terms in the doctrine of the Holy 
Trinity must be discouraged. 

Against Monarchianism, on the one hand, and Tritheism, on 
the other, the Christian Church teaches that there are three Per¬ 
sons in one essence (tres personae in una essentia, tqeIs vnooxdoev; 
xal /xia ovoia). Against Arianism, in particular, which affirmed 
that the Xoyog is a creature of God ( xziois, noir\pa), the Nicene 
Council declared that the Son is “of one substance” with the Father 
(dfxoovoios, coessentialis, consulstantialis). The meaning of these 
terms is not that the Son is of like essence with the Father 
( o/Aoiovaioe , unius essentiae specie), but that the one and same 
essence, which exists but once in God, is alike that of the Father 
and of the Son (unius essentiae numero), so that the Son is “God 
of God” and “very God of very God.” This doctrine is truly Scrip¬ 
tural, John 10, 30. 

The word essence (ovoia, essentia ), used of God, signifies the 
divine nature with all its attributes, which exists but once (singu- 



154 


THE DOCTRINE OP GOD. 


laris) in the Three Persons (una numero essentia). “By the term 
essence, or ovola, is meant the divine nature as it is in itself, all 
of which, with its attributes, is most simply one and singular, and 
thus also of the Three Persons the essence is only one” (Baier.) 
The term essence is therefore applied to God in a unique sense. 
When we apply it to men, namely, to denote something which is 
common to all men, the word is used as a generic term (nomen 
universale) or as an abstract noun (nomen dbstractum), which 
denotes something that does not exist concretely, but is merely ab¬ 
stracted from the concretely existing human beings. (Ex.: It is 
the essence of man to think or to will.) However, when we speak 
of the divine essence which is common to the Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost, the term essence is neither generic nor abstract, but 
concrete (nomen concretum), denoting something that exists ac¬ 
tually and concretely and belongs to the three divine Persons as 
one in number (numero). In other words, the term essence denotes 
God Himself as He divinely exists as One in Three. “The essence 
of God is God’s spiritual and independent nature, common to the 
three divine Persons.” (Hollaz.) 

By the term person (persona, vnooxaoig) we understand in the 
realm of human thought an individual and rational being existing 
by itself (suppositum intelligens). Thus all men and angels are 
persons. But also this term, when used of God, is applied in 
a unique sense; for when we say that the Father, Son, and Holy 
Ghost are three persons ( personae, vnoaxdaeig, ngoocona), we, on 
the one hand, reject the erroneous opinion that there are three 
qualities or energies (Potenzen) and affirm that they are three 
rational individuals; yet, on the other hand, we deny that the 
Three Persons are three distinct essences, or three distinct Gods, 
and affirm that, while they are three rational individuals, so that 
the Father is not the Son nor the Son the Holy Ghost, neverthe¬ 
less, the Three Persons have only one and the same divine essence 
in number (una numero essentia) and exert only one and the same 
power ad extra (una numero potentia). Hence, while the Three 
Persons are distinguished from one another not merely notionally 
(notionaliter), but really (realiter), they are in essence numer¬ 
ically one. When we speak of men, the axiom applies: As many 
persons, so many essences (Quot personae, tot essentiae); but when 
we speak of God this axiom does not apply, since there are three 
distinct divine Persons, and yet there is only one divine Essence, 
or God. 



THE DOCTRINE OF OOD. 


155 


With respect to the term Trinity, Luther admitted that it does 
not “sound well so to call God”; but he adds that, since the article 
of the Holy Trinity is so far beyond our human mind and language, 
God must pardon us if we stammer and prattle about it as well 
as we can, provided only that our faith is pure and right; for 
the term Trinity merely expresses the truth that God is three in 
person and one in divine essence. From this it is clear that the 
term Trinity, just as the other terms used in explaining the doc¬ 
trine of God, has not been coined to satisfy reason, but only to 
express the doctrine of Scripture concerning the true God. Human 
reason, when judging the Christian doctrine of God, must choose 
either between Unitarianism or Tritheism; in other words, it must 
either deny the three divine Persons (Monarchianism) or the one 
divine essence (Tritheism; Subordinationism). For this reason 
the Christian theologian must a priori desist from presenting the 
doctrine of the Holy Trinity in such a way as to make it compre¬ 
hensible to reason. Every attempt of this kind involves either 
a self-deception, i. e., the supposition that things have been ex¬ 
plained which cannot be explained, or a surrender of the Christian 
doctrine of God. Nevertheless, though the doctrine of the Holy 
Trinity is beyond reason, it is not against reason or self-contra¬ 
dictory, since Unity is not predicated of God in the same relation 
as Trinity. A real contradiction would exist only if the Christian 
doctrine would affirm: “There is one essence, and there are three 
essences; there is one person, and there are three persons.” How¬ 
ever, the Christian doctrine of God is: “There is one divine essence, 
and there are three divine Persons.” 

With respect to the relation of the Three Persons to one an¬ 
other the Christian Church teaches as follows: The real distinc¬ 
tion of the Persons (realis distinctio, non tantum notionalis) is 
based upon the facts that the Father from eternity has generated 
the Son, John 1,14, while the Father and the Son have spirated the 
Holy Spirit, John 14, 26; 15, 26. 

These divine acts of generation and spiration are called per¬ 
sonal acts (adits personates) because they are not common to the 
Three Persons, but belong to, and distinguish, the individual Per¬ 
sons in the Godhead. To the Father, Holy Scripture ascribes the 
act of generation, John 1, 14, by which He communicated to the 
Son the fulness of the Godhead, or the entire divine essence, Col. 
2, 3. 9. Hence the Father possesses the divine essence unbegotten 
(dyF.rvrj'&cbg), while the Son possesses it begotten (yevvrjddx;). 



156 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


Scripture, moreover, affirms that the Father and the Son have 
spirated the Holy Ghost, Matt. 10, 20; Gal. 4, 6; for just as the 
Second Person is called the Son of the Father, so the Third Person 
is called the Spirit of the Father and of the Son. Through the 
spiration the Holy Ghost received the entire divine essence. Matt. 
28,19; Acts 5, 3. 4, so that He is from eternity true God with the 
Father and the Son. 

On the basis of the personal acts, or the opera ad intra (gen¬ 
eration and spiration), we distinguish the notiones personales of 
the Three Persons: the iyevvyola (innascibilitas) of the Father, the 
yewrjoia (nascibilitas) of the Son, and the IxTidgevois (processio, 
spiratio passiva) of the Holy Ghost, and also the proprietates 
personales: the paternity (patemitas) of the Father, the son- 
ship (filiatio) of the Son, and the procession (processio) of the 
Holy Ghost. By personal properties we mean those peculiarities 
which one Person of the Godhead possesses in relation to one of 
the other Persons or to both, and by personal notations we mean 
the marks by which in general one Person can be recognized as 
distinct from another. These terms must not be regarded as 
superfluous; they are necessary to distinguish the divine Persons, 
as Scripture itself does. 

In connection with the spiration of the Holy Ghost we must 
consider also the question of the Filioque, or whether the Holy 
Ghost was spirated also by the Son. The Eastern Church denied 
the Filioque, while the Western Church, on the basis of Scripture, 
affirmed it; for Holy Scripture ascribes the same relation of the 
Holy Ghost to the Son as it does to the Father. As He is called 
the Spirit of the Father, Matt. 10, 20, so He is also called the Spirit 
of the Son, Gal. 4, 6; and as He is sent of the Father, John 14, 26, 
so He is 6aid to be sent also of the Son, John 15, 26. Because the 
Holy Spirit proceeds also from the Son, Christ could breathe and 
bestow Him upon His disciples, John 20, 22. 

The actus personales are also called inward operations (opera 
ad intra) because they occur within the Godhead and extend from 
one Person to another (generation and spiration). From the in¬ 
ward operations we distinguish the outward operations (opera ad 
extra), or the works in which the three Persons of the Godhead 
cooperate, or concur (creation, redemption, sanctification, etc.). 
Of the inward operations the axiom holds: “The inward operations 
are divided.” (Opera ad intra divisa sunt.) Of the outward opera¬ 
tions the axiom obtains: “The outward operations are undivided.” 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


1B7 


(Opera ad extra sunt indivisa.) These axioms express the Scrip¬ 
tural truth that the inward operations are performed by individual 
Persons, while the outward operations are performed by the Three 
Persons in common, or together. If at times Scripture ascribes 
creation to the Father, redemption to the Son, and sanctification 
to the Holy Ghost, this is done by appropriation, which, however, 
does not exclude the divine operation of the other Persons. The 
only opus ad extra in which the Father and the Holy Ghost did not 
directly concur, was the work of redemption (the incarnation, suf¬ 
fering, death, resurrection, and exaltation of Christ); for while it 
is true that the Son was sent by the Father and sustained by Him 
in His redemptive work, and while it is equally true that He was 
anointed with the Holy Ghost (Ps. 45, 7; Heb. 1, 9; Acts 10, 38) 
for His work, Scripture ascribes the work of redemption to Christ 
alone, Eph. 2,13; Col. 1, 20; 1 John 1, 7. To express this unique 
character of Christ’s redemptive work, the dogmaticians have called 
it an opus mixtum, or a work which Christ accomplished alone, 
but in the performance of which He was not without the Father 
and the Holy Ghost. (For the actus personates compare Luther’s 
exposition of the Three Symbols, St. L., X, 993 ff.) 

The name Fattier is sometimes used essentially ( ovoicodws), 
referring to the divine Persons equally (Jas. 1,17; 2 Cor. 6,17.18; 
Luke 12, 32), and sometimes personally (vnooTaTixtis'), referring 
alone to the First Person of the Godhead, John 10, 30; 14, 9; 
1 John 2, 23. So also the name Spirit is used essentially, John 
4, 24, and personally. Matt. 12, 31; Mark 1,10. 

By the term neg^eoggoig (immanentia, immeatio, circumin- 
cessio) is understood the mutual and most intimate inherence 
(inexistentia mutua et singularissima), by which one Person on 
account of the unity of the divine essence is within another, John 
14,11; 17,21. By this term the Christian Church precludes the 
error of regarding the Three Persons as subsisting separately 
alongside one another. By the term equality Christian theology 
expresses the fact that one divine Person is in itself not greater 
than another, and by the term sameness, that the Three Persons 
have the same nature and consequently also cooperate in the same 
opera ad extra, John 5,19.17. 

On the basis of Holy Scripture, Hollaz defines the Three Per¬ 
sons as follows: “a) God the Father is the First Person of the 
Godhead, neither begotten nor proceeding, but from eternity be¬ 
getting the Son, the substantial image of Himself, and with the 



158 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


Son from eternity breathing forth the Holy Spirit, creating, pre¬ 
serving, and governing all things, sending His Son as the Redeemer 
and the Holy Ghost as the Sanctifier of the human race, b) The 
Son of God is the Second Person of the Godhead, begotten of the 
Father from eternity, of the same essence and majesty with the 
Father, who with the Father from eternity breathes forth the Holy 
Spirit and in the fulness of time assumed human nature in His 
own Person that He might redeem and save the human race, 
c) The Holy Spirit is the Third Person of the Godhead, of the 
same essence with the Father and the Son, who from eternity pro¬ 
ceeds from the Father and the Son and in time is sent forth by 
both to sanctify the hearts of those who are to be saved.” ( Doclr . 
Theol., p. 134.) 

In connection with the terminology of the Church regarding 
the doctrine of God we may consider the debated question whether 
God may be logically defined or not. In replying to the question, 
our dogmaticians distinguish between “a perfect definition, which 
exactly conforms to accurate logical rules, and a general descrip¬ 
tion, drawn from Scripture.” (Gerhard.) The inadmissibility 
of a definition of God in the strict sense is argued, in the main, 
a) from the want of a genus, since God has no true and logical 
genus, and b) from the divine perfection of God, He being the 
Supreme Being, so that nothing is beyond Him. (Gerhard.) 
Nevertheless, though God cannot be logically defined as creatures 
are defined since He belongs in a class by Himself, a general de¬ 
scription of God, drawn from Scripture, is sufficient for such 
a knowledge of God as is needed for salvation. Accordingly God 
has been described as “the first Being, who is of Himself and the 
Cause of all other things,” or more completely, by Melanchthon 
(Loci Theol., I, 13) : “God is a spiritual essence, intelligent, 
eternal, true, good, pure, just, merciful, most free, of vast power 
and wisdom — the eternal Father, who begat the Son, His own 
image, from eternity, and the Son, the coeternal image of the 
Father, and the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and 
the Son.” 

5. THE HOLY TRINITY REVEALED IN THE 
OLD TESTAMENT. 

That the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is clearly taught in 
the New Testament is a fact readily admitted by all Christians. 
The Unitarians, who deny even the New Testament proof for the 
Trinity, are outside the pale of the Christian Church. The Holy 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


159 


Trinity is revealed: a) in the solemn formula of Baptism given 
by Christ, Matt. 28,19, in which the three Persons of the Godhead 
are represented as equal in authority, dignity, and essence; b) in 
the wonderful theophany at the baptism of Christ, Matt. 3,16.17, 
where the three Persons of the Godhead were distinctly manifested; 
c) in the inspired benediction of St. Paul, 2 Cor. 13,14, where the 
spiritual blessings of the Three Persons are expressly named. The 
passage 1 John 5, 7 is too doubtful to be used as a proof for the 
Holy Trinity. It is said that Cyprian (f 258) quotes it in his 
work De Unitate Ecclesiae: ‘‘Et iterum de Patre et Filio et Spiritu 
Sancto scriptum est: ‘Et ires unurn est.’ " Nevertheless it is best 
to disregard this passage altogether as a proof-text for the doctrine 
of the Holy Trinity. 

However, while all Christians admit the proofs for the Trinity 
as given in the New Testament, it has been claimed that the Old 
Testament, while containing indications and traces (indicia et 
vestigia) of the Holy Trinity, does not exhibit the doctrine so 
clearly that it could be believed or taught on the basis of the Old 
Testament passages (Calixtus; modern theologians). To this 
charge our dogmaticians replied (Gerhard, III, 218): “We do not 
say that in the Old Testament there is the same clearness and 
evidence of the testimonies concerning the Trinity as in the New 
Testament; but we assert that from the Old Testament some testi¬ 
monies, in exhibiting the doctrine of the Trinity, both can and 
ought to be cited, since God always from the beginning revealed 
Himself thus in order that the Church at all times might acknowl¬ 
edge, worship, and praise Him ... as three distinct Persons in one 
essence.” (Doctr. Theol., p. 157.) As a matter of fact the Old 
Testament contains not only mere “indications” of the Holy 
Trinity, but clear passages, in which the doctrine is unmistakably 
set forth. Such passages are those: a) in which God speaks of 
Himself in the plural number, Gen. 1,26; b) in which the Lord 
speaks of the Lord, Gen. 19,24; c) in which the Son of God is 
expressly named, Ps. 2, 7; d) in which three Persons of the God¬ 
head are distinctly enumerated, Gen. 1, 1. 2; 2 Sam. 23, 2; Ps. 
33,6; Is. 42,1; 48,16.17; 61,1; e) in which the name Jehovah 
or God is thrice repeated in the same relation, Num. 6, 24—26; 
Ps. 42,1. 2; Is. 33, 22; Jer. 33, 2; Dan. 9,19; f) from the tris- 
agion of the angels, Is. 6, 3 ; g) from the passages in which the 
Angel of the Lord (nvr tjnSd) is identified with God, Gen. 48, 
15.16; Ex. 3,1—7; h) from the reference of Christ to the Old 



160 


THE DOCTBINE OF GOD. 


Testament when He proved the true deity and divine personality 
of the Son of God, Matt. 22, 41—46 compared with Ps. 110, 1. 
Certainly no one has ever been saved who did not believe in the 
true God (the Triune God) and the true Savior of the world (the 
Second Person of the Godhead), since this truth is stated so 
clearly in Scripture, Acts 4,12; John 6,23; 1 John 2,23. Nor 
is the plan of salvation which is taught in the New Testament dif¬ 
ferent from that which was taught in the Old Testament, Rom. 
3, 21—24; 4,1—3. We rightly hold therefore that the doctrine of 
the Holy Trinity is so clearly set forth in the Old Testament that 
the believers in the Old Testament most assuredly had a true 
knowledge of God and of the promised Savior, His beloved Son. 

6. GOD’S ESSENCE AND ATTRIBUTES. 

(De Essentia et Attrlbutis Bel.) 

1. THE DOCTRINE IN GENERAL. 

Holy Scripture describes God as the Supreme Being (ens 
omnium excellentissimum) or as the absolutely Perfect Essence 
(Deut. 10,17: “God of gods and Lord of lords”; 1 Tim. 6,16.16: 
“the blessed and only Potentate,” uovo? dwaorgg), or simply as 
the Absolute Being (ens primum), who “is before all things” and 
by whom “all things consist,” Col. 1,17. At times Scripture ap¬ 
plies the name god or gods to creatures (dii nuncupativi, Xeyofievoi 
•&eoi), either because they perform real (John 10, 35; Ps. 82, 6) or 
supposed (Deut. 4, 28) divine functions, and are therefore vested 
either rightly or wrongly with divine authority (1 Cor. 8, 5, propter 
analogiam quandam, vel veram, vel fictam). Nevertheless Scrip¬ 
ture distinguishes clearly between the so-called gods (dii nuncu¬ 
pativi) and the one, true, and living God, 1 Cor. 8, 5. 6; Matt. 
19,17. Magistrates (Ps. 82, 6) and idols (Deut. 4, 28) are indeed 
called gods deot), but God alone is Jehovah (nin\ nomen Dei 

essentiale et incommunicabile). 

The names which Holy Scripture applies to the true God are 
not empty titles, but describe God according to His divine essence, 
attributes, and works. This is true especially of the essential and 
incommunicable name of God “Jehovah,” which He Himself ex¬ 
plains as “I Am That I Am” (Ex. 3, 14. 15) or as the eternal, 
unchangeable divine Being (Luther: "tauter 1st” that is, pure 
Being). This explains why that name is never applied to creatures. 
(Is. 42, 8: “I, Jehovah; that is My name.”) The real pronuncia¬ 
tion of the tetragrammaton is perhaps Yahweh (nvv), but since the 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


161 


pronunciation “Jehovah” has become current in the Church, it 
would be intolerable pedantry to insist upon the supposed “original 
pronunciation.” 

When we describe human beings, we ascribe to them both 
a nature and attributes. Just so Holy Scripture, accommodating 
itself to the laws of human thought and speech, ordinarily speaks 
of God as possessing both a divine essence and divine attributes. 
In other words, it speaks of God’s attributes, such as omnipotence, 
grace, love, etc., as inhering in the divine essence. Nevertheless 
the attributes of God are not accidents (accidentia), but His very 
divine essence, since God is absolutely simple in His divine Being, 
Ex. 3,14.15. “The properties, or attributes, of God are His very 
essence. No accidents may be predicated of God.” Or we may 
say: Since we cannot conceive of an absolutely simple being (ens 
simplex), God has graciously revealed Himself to us according to 
attributes. 

In this way we gain of God an adequate conception, which, 
though incomplete, is essentially correct, 1 Cor. 13, 9—12. Of the 
divine attributes Gerhard writes (111,84): “The attributes, exist 
inseparably in God; for as it is impossible that the essence of an 
object may be separated from the object itself, so also the attributes 
cannot be separated from God, since they are the very essence of 
God.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 122.) And Calov (II, 222) : “If the at¬ 
tributes really differed from the essence after the manner of acci¬ 
dents, a composition in God would be predicated.” (Ibid.) Our 
dogmaticians are therefore right in saying that “the divine attri¬ 
butes are distinguished from the divine essence, not really, but only 
according to our mode of conceiving.” Essentia et attributa in Deo 
non realiter, sed nostro concipiendi modo differ uni; distinguuntur 
autem et ab essentia divina et inter se propter intellectus nostri 
imperfectionem. Attributa divina, quamvis in Deo non distincta, 
in nostris tamen conceptibus distinguenda sunt.” Since, however, 
Scripture carefully distinguishes between the various attributes of 
God, the Christian theologian, too, must distinguish between them, 
as, for example, between divine justice and grace, divine wrath and 
love, etc. Where this distinction is not observed, the entire the¬ 
ology becomes false. (Cp. the denial of the Law on account of the 
Gospel.) 

When treating the doctrine of the divine essence and attri¬ 
butes, the question has been debated: “In what sense are essence 
and attributes ascribed to God and to creatures ?” The answer is: 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 


11 



162 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


Not a) univocally (univoce), so that they belong to God and the 
creatures in precisely the same meaning, nor b) equivocally 
(aequivoce), so that the attributes when used of God have an 
entirely different meaning than when they are used of creatures, 
but c) analogically (analogice), so that the attributes ascribed to 
creatures bear an analogy, or resemblance, to the attributes of God; 
that is to say, the attributes belong rightly both to God and men, 
but not in the same manner nor in the same degree. When we 
say, “God lives, and man lives,” or, “God loves, and man loves,” 
we ascribe to God perfect, absolute, and independent life and love, 
but to man imperfect, relative, and dependent life and love. The 
same attributes which God has in Himself as His most perfect, 
divine essence man has from God as His free gifts, and not indeed 
as his essence, but as accidents, which may be lost. Col. 1,17: “He 
is before all things, and by Him all things consist”; Acts 17,28: 
“In Him we live and move and have our being.” The basic differ¬ 
ence between the Creator and the creatures determines also the 
difference in the possession of attributes. The importance of prop¬ 
erly deciding the question is patent from the following: If we 
ascribe the essence and attributes to God and creatures univocally 
(Duns Scotus, f 1308), the essential difference between God and 
the creatures is denied, and the creatures are coordinated with God 
and made divine (pantheism). On the other hand, if we ascribe 
the essence and attributes to God and creatures equivocally (Peter 
Aureolus, f 1321; the Franciscans), it is impossible for us to 
know God (agnosticism), since then we cannot tell what really the 
attributes in God mean. (What does it mean when God is said to 
be Love? 1 John 4,16.) However, if we ascribe the essence and 
attributes to God by way of analogy, or resemblance, then in our 
contemplation of God we rise from the imperfection of the human 
attributes to the absolute perfection of the divine, Is. 49, 15. 
Augustine says: "Condescendit nobis Deus, ut nos consurgamu-s.” 

The divine attributes have been divided into negative and 
positive, or quiescent and operative, or absolute and relative, or 
immanent and transient, etc. But no matter how we may classify 
the divine attributes, we must in every case acquire our knowledge 
of them only from Holy Scripture, never from reason or specu¬ 
lation. In other words, God Himself must inform us what we are 
to understand by divine omnipotence, divine love, divine grace, etc. 
Many pernicious errors have arisen from the fact that theologians 
endeavored to determine the divine attributes a priori, or from 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


163 


reason. For instance, on the basis of divine love errorists have 
denied divine justice (the necessity of Christ’s vicarious atonement, 
Modernism, Unitarianism) and the possibility of eternal punish¬ 
ment (Kussellism, Universalism). As the doctrine of the Holy 
Trinity, so also that of the divine essence and attributes is beyond 
reason, since God is absolutely incomprehensible; we know of 
God’s attributes only so much as He Himself has revealed to us. 

In more recent times, dogmaticians have classified the divine 
attributes according to God’s relation (Bezogenheit zur Welt) or 
non-relation (Abgezogenheit zur Welt) to the world, or according 
to God’s absolute essence (eternity, etc.), His absolute sovereignty 
(omnipotence, etc.), and His absolute goodness (love, etc.), or 
according to God’s divine existence, knowledge, and will, etc. 
While some of these are quite helpful and commendable, the 
modern classifications in general improve very little on those of 
our older dogmaticians so far as their practical value is concerned. 
All the classifications of the divine attributes are more or less 
inadequate. 

2. THE NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTES. 

(Attributa Negativa.) 

The negative attributes are those by which all imperfections 
which we observe in creatures are removed from God, since nothing 
in any way imperfect can be ascribed to Him. They are also 
called quiescent (dvevegytjTa), since they have no specific reference 
to the actions of God, or immanent (absoluta) attributes, since 
they describe the divine essence absolutely and in itself. These 
attributes are: divine unity, simplicity, immutability, infinity, 
immensity, eternity, omnipresence. 

a. Divine unity (unitas) is the attribute of God by virtue of 
which the divine essence is absolutely single; not only undivided, 
but also indivisible. Unity is ascribed to God a) absolutely, that 
is, the divine essence is neither divided nor divisible, John 4, 24; 
Ex. 3,14.15, and b) exclusively, since besides God there is no God, 
Deut. 6, 4; 4, 35. (Cp. Doctr. Theol., p. 118ff.) 

b. Divine simplicity (simplicitas) is the divine attribute of 
God according to which He is truly and really uncompounded (not 
compounded of matter and form, of integral parts, of substance and 
accident, of nature and subsistence). Hollaz writes: “God is said 
to be one, not in kind (specie), but in number (numero), since He 
is a being entirely alone, not only in Himself undivided, but also 
indivisible because of the entire simplicity of the divine essence. 



164 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


as there is no composition in God.” (Ex. 3,14.15: “I Am That 
I Am.”) The attribute of spirituality, John 4,24, is comprised in 
that of simplicity. 

c. Divine immutability (immutdbilitas) is the attribute of God 
according to which He is liable to no change whatever, neither as 
to existence (Rom. 1,23; 1 Tim. 1,17; 6,16) nor as to accidents 
(Jas. 1,17) nor as to will or purpose (Num. 23,19; Prov. 19,21; 
Mai. 3, 6). If Holy Scripture ascribes to God change of mind 
(Gen. 6, 6; 1 Sam. 15,11) or change of place (Gen. 11, 5), it does 
this in accommodation to our mode of perceiving. These passages 
do not assert that God is subject to change as men are (1 Sam. 
15, 29), but must be understood in a manner becoming God 
(deojiQEndx;). Gerhard writes (I, 110): "The affections which 
Scripture ascribes to God do not prove any mutability of the 
divine essence; for those things which are spoken of anthropo- 
pathically (dv^gcononadcbc) must be understood in a sense be¬ 
coming God (dEOTiQEnax;).” Scripture thus speaks of God in a 
twofold manner: a) as He is in Himself, immutable and incor¬ 
ruptible, forever exalted over space and time, 1 Sam. 15, 29; 
Ps. 90,4; and b) as He accommodates Himself to our conception 
of space and time, 1 Sam. 15,11; Gen. 11, 5. Nevertheless, wher¬ 
ever Scripture pictures God anthropomorphically or anthropo- 
pathically, this is not a mere modus loquendi, but a true descrip¬ 
tion of God, though after our human mode of perceiving. In other 
words, when the immutable God is said to be angry or jealous 
(1 Pet. 5, 5) toward the wicked or gracious (Luke 1, 52. 53) to 
penitent sinners, we must regard Him precisely as these expres¬ 
sions describe Him, though in a manner conforming with His 
divine perfection. In Deum nulla cadit mutatio. 

The question whether the work of creation or of incarnation 
changed the immutable God, Gerhard answers as follows (1,124): 
"By no means; for in time He did that which from eternity He 
had decreed in His immutable will.” The reason for this is evident. 
The creation was not something occurring in God (pantheism), but 
rather something outside God (Christian dualism), namely, the 
calling into being of things that did not exist before, but had been 
determined by God from eternity (decree of creation). Neither was 
the incarnation any change in the divine essence, but the assump¬ 
tion of the human nature into the person of the Xoyos, as determined 
by God from eternity (decree of redemption). 

d. Divine infinity (infinitas) is that attribute of God according 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


165 


to which He is contained within no bounds either of time (eternity) 
or of space (immensity). Scripture ascribes to God infinity a) as 
to His essence, Ps. 145, 3, and b) as to His attributes, Ps. 147, 5. 
Hence we say correctly that not only God in Himself (divine 
essence) is infinite, but that also His knowledge, power, wisdom, 
grace, love, etc., are infinite. 

e. Divine immensity (immensitas) is that attribute of God 
according to which He cannot be measured by, or included in, any 
local confines, Jer. 23, 24; 1 Kings 8,27. Quenstedt defines the 
divine immensity as “the interminable ubiety, by virtue of which 
God cannot but be everywhere in His own essence,” or as “the 
absolute interminability of the divine essence.” Since God cannot 
be measured by, or included in, anything finite, Is. 40,15—17, we 
should not judge Him by our reason (Unitarians), but regard Him 
precisely as Scripture pictures Him, 1 Tim. 6,16, i. e., as the divine 
Being who is exalted over all creatures. 

f. Divine eternity (aetemitas), absolutely so called (in oppo¬ 
sition to “long time”), is that attribute according to which the 
divine essence is without beginning or end, without succession or 
change, Ps. 102, 27; 90, 2; Gen. 21, 33; Is. 40, 28; 1 Tim. 1,17; 
Rev. 1, 4; etc. Scripture uses the doctrine of the divine attributes 
both for our warning and for our consolation. Por when we oppose 
God, we oppose the one, immutable, infinite, immense, eternal 
divine Being whose wrath and punishment are endless, 2 These. 
1, 9; and on the other hand, when we entrust ourselves to God, we 
are putting our confidence in the one, immutable, infinite, immense, 
eternal divine Being, whose love and mercy are equally endless, 
1 Thess.4,17; 2 Cor. 5,1. 

In connection with God’s divine eternity we may consider 
also His divine aseity ( aseitas), according to which God is abso¬ 
lutely of Himself and independent of anything outside Himself, 
Rom. 11, 33—36. (Aseitas est attributum, quo Deus Uberrima 
ipsius causa est et nemini quidquam debet, sed ipse solus est rerum 
omnium Auctor.) 

g. Divine omnipresence (omnipraesentia) is the attribute of 
God according to which He is illocally, but essentially, everywhere. 
Quenstedt: “God is actually present to all His creatures.” With 
respect to God’s omnipresence we must note the following: — 

1. God is omnipresent with regard to His essence, not only 
with regard to His divine operation, Jer. 23, 24; in other words, 
God never operates in absentia (Calvinists), for wherever He 



166 


THE DOCTRINE OP GOD. 


works, there He is, Ps. 139, 7—10. Gerhard writes (III, 122): 
"God is present to all things, not only by virtue and efficacy, nor 
only by sight and knowledge, but also in His entire and individual 
essence; for He is immense and infinite, not only in power and 
knowledge, but also in essence.” ( Doctr.Theol p. 125.) 

To Christ, according to His human nature. Scripture ascribes 
a local presence (presentia localis, Luke 2,12), an illocal presence 
(praesentia illocalis, John 20,19), and a repletive presence (prae- 
sentia repletiva, Eph. 1, 23; 4,10). 

2. God is present in all creatures, yet He is never a part of 
them, but always remains the transmundane, transcendent God. 
Deus nunquam in compositionem creaturarum venit. The omni¬ 
presence of God must therefore not be understood in the sense of 
pantheistic immanence. While it is true that God is so intimately 
joined to all creatures that in Him they live and move and have 
their being. Acts 17, 28; Col. 1, 17, nevertheless the difference 
between God and His creatures always remains as great as that 
between the infinite and the finite, Num. 23, 19; 1 Sam. 15, 29. 
Gerhard writes (III, 122): “God is everywhere present, not 
avvEXTobg, so as to be comprehended, but owExuxwg, so as to com¬ 
prehend and contain all things.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 125.) Again: 
“The Scholastics say that God is everywhere, not locally or by way 
of circumscription . . . nor definitely . . . , but repletively; yet 
this must not be understood in a gross and corporeal manner . . . , 
but in a divine manner, so that God, though He is confined to no 
place because of the immensity of His essence, yet contains all 
places.” (Hid.) Against the objection that God cannot be present 
in “impure places” (Erasmus) we must hold that “God is every¬ 
where and fills all things,” Deum esse ubique et replere omnia 
(Luther). That God is thus everywhere both enter et potenter is 
a clear Scriptural doctrine, Eph. 1, 20—23; 4,10. 

3. God is omnipresent, yet a) without multiplication (multi- 
plicatio) of His essence (polytheism), b) without extension (ex- 
tensio), c) without contraction (rarefactio), d) without division 
(divisio), and e) without commingling (commixtio). In other 
words, we must not think of God’s omnipresence in a corporeal 
way, as if He, when present, occupied space or were subject to 
space (1 Kings 8,27; Is. 66,1); for "God’s presence is a) illocal, 
b) indivisible, c) incomprehensible to our reason, d) effective and 
operative, and e) containing within itself all things” (Gerhard). 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


167 


The true doctrine of God’s omnipresence is of special importance 
for the right understanding of the Lord’s Supper (Real Presence). 

In connection with the doctrine of the divine omnipresence 
a number of questions may be considered. The first is: “Is the 
universe infinite ?” or: “Is there any space outside this universe ?” 
On the basis of Scripture this question must be denied, since space 
belongs to creation and all creatures are in God, Col. 1,17; Acts 
17, 28. To predicate infinity of space would be tantamount to 
deifying the universe, which as a creature is finite. Deus dat loco 
et rebus , quae sunt in loco, suum esse. The second question is: 
“Is there in the divine manifestations of wrath or grace any special 
approach of the divine essence (specials approximate essentiae 
divinae) 9” In view of God’s immensity this question must be 
answered in the negative, since the divine essence is never sepa¬ 
rated from the creatures, but is always present; yet as anthropo- 
pathic expressions such Scripture statements as John 14, 23; Gen. 
11, 5 are to be considered not as a mere mode of speaking (modus 
loquendi), but as an assertion of truth which, properly (deongEnwg) 
understood, is designed for either our comfort or warning. The 
last question: “Was God essentially operative before Creation?” 
must be classified among the foolish questions, which are unprofit¬ 
able and vain, Titus 3, 9. Since God has not revealed anything 
with respect to any creative work before this world was made, 
human speculation on this point is useless. Nevertheless, on the 
one hand, we must not regard God as ever having been essentially 
inoperative; on the other, we have no Scriptural ground to assume 
that God ever created a universe before this present world. The 
warning which applies from God’s omnipresence is clear from Jer. 
23, 24; Ps. 139, 7ff., the comfort from Ps. 23, 4; Matt. 28, 20. 

3. POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES. 

The positive attributes (attributa ivEgyrjzixa, positiva opera- 
tiva, transeuntia, relativa) are those by which we ascribe to God, 
in a specific and singular sense, all the perfections which we find 
in His creatures. These are: life, knowledge, wisdom, will, holi¬ 
ness, justice, veracity, power, goodness (grace, mercy, love, long- 
suffering, etc.). 

a. Divine life (vita) is the attribute of God by which He 
always is and shows Himself active. In particular, God is life 
1) essentially, since He is avz6£(oog, having life iv iavico, John 
5,26, that is, He is life in Himself and of Himself, by His own 



168 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


nature and essence; 2) effectively, since He is the cause and origin 
of all life outside Himself, Acts 17,28; Deut. 32, 39. Negatively 
this attribute is expressed by immortality, 1 Tim. 6,16, and incor¬ 
ruptibility, Eom. 1, 23; 1 Tim. 1,17. In contradistinction to the 
idols of the heathen, God is the “living God,” Acts 14,15, to whom 
all creatures owe their existence, Acts 17, 25. The warning con¬ 
nected with this attribute may be deduced from Heb. 10, 31; the 
consolation from 1 Tim. 3,15; 4,10. 

b. Divine knowledge (scientia) is the attribute of God by 
which He through one simple and eternal act of His mind knows 
all things which have been, are, and shall be, or even in any way 
can be, that is, all things which are conditionally future or possible, 
1 Sam. 2, 3; 1 John 3, 20; 1 Kings 8, 39; Ps. 7, 9; 34,15; 139,1; 
Prov. 15, 3. God’s knowledge is distinguished from human knowl¬ 
edge: a) by its extent, since God knows all things (John 21,17: 
omniscientia) , the future things (Is. 41, 22. 23: praescientia) , all 
possible and conditionally future or possible things (1 Sam. 23,12; 
Matt. 11, 23: scientia de futuro conditionata, scientia media) ; 
b) by His manner of knowing, since God knows all things whatso¬ 
ever through one simple and eternal act of the mind (Deus res non 
per species intelligibiles, sed in se sive in esse proprio cognoscit. 
Homo res adspicit, Deus perspicit.) Thus God knows the very 
thoughts of men, 1 Kings 8, 39; Acts 15, 8; John 2, 25. The reve¬ 
lation of God’s perfect knowledge should serve for our warning. 
Is. 41, 22. 23; Ps. 139,12, and for our consolation, Is. 66, 2; Matt. 
6, 32. To describe God’s perfect knowledge, our dogmaticians have 
divided it also into: 1) natural knowledge (scientia naturalise 
essentialis), according to which God fully knows Himself; 2) free 
knowledge (scientia libera), according to which He knows all things 
outside Himself; and 3) mediate knowledge (scientia media), ac¬ 
cording to which He knows all possible and conditionally future 
or possible things. 

In this connection we may consider the important question r 
“How does God’s infallible foreknowledge agree with the freedom 
of man’s will and human responsibility?” The question is impor¬ 
tant, since, on the basis of God’s infallible foreknowledge, men 
have denied either the freedom of the will and human responsibility 
(Stoicism) or, on the basis of the human responsibility, the infal¬ 
lible foreknowledge, or omniscience, of God (Atheism, Agnos¬ 
ticism). While the question involves mysteries which we cannot 
solve in this life, Scripture nevertheless teaches the following: 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


169 


a) The foreknowledge of God embraces all things and is infallible, 
Ps. 139,1—4; Eev. 3,15. b) God’s foreknowledge is not the effi¬ 
cient cause of the evil which He foresees. The Formula of Con-cord 
teaches correctly: “The foreknowledge of God is nothing else than 
that God knows all things before they happen, as it is written 
Dan. 2,28. This foreknowledge extends alike over the godly and 
the wicked, but it is not the cause of evil, neither of sin, namely,, 
of doing what is wrong (which originally arises from the devil and 
the wicked, perverse will of man), nor of their ruin [that men 
should perish], for which they themselves are responsible; but it 
only regulates it, and fixes a limit to it how long it should last, 
and all this to the end that it should serve His elect for their sal¬ 
vation, notwithstanding that it is evil in itself.” (Epitome, 
XI, 3. 4.) 

Our confession thus distinguishes correctly a) between the 
divine foreknowledge and the origin of evil and b) between the 
divine foreknowledge in general and the special divine foreknowl¬ 
edge (Amos 3, 2; Gal. 4, 9: nosse cum affectu et effectu), to which 
the saints of God owe their election and salvation. Kom. 8, 29. 30 :. 
“Whom He did foreknow. He also did predestinate.” With regard 
to the mysteries which remain in spite of these revelations the 
Formula of Concord rightly exhorts all believers “not to reason 
in their thoughts, draw conclusions, nor inquire curiously into these 
matters, but adhere to His revealed Word, to which He points us.” 
(Thor. Decl., XI, 54—57.) 

When the question is asked: “Do all things happen as God 
foreknows them?” then indeed the answer must be in the affir¬ 
mative. When the question is asked: “Do men act under coer¬ 
cion?” the answer must be in the negative. Judas’s betrayal of 
Christ was a voluntary performance of evil, John 14, 26—30, just 
as Peter’s confession of Christ was a voluntary performance of 
good, John 6, 65—71. Neither acted under coercion, though the 
one was under sin, the other under grace. Holy Scripture rig¬ 
orously rules out all fatalistic or deterministic speculations. 

While there is neither a prius nor a posterius in God, but all 
things are ever present before Him, Heb. 4, 13, Holy Scripture 
nevertheless in accommodation to our feeble understanding speaks 
of God’s foreknowledge (praescientia), since we have no conception 
at all of the perpetual “to-day” or “present,” Ps. 2, 7. Just so the 
Christian theologian must therefore speak when he describes the 
divine knowledge with respect to future events. The question 



170 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


whether prescience may be ascribed also to men, angels, and de¬ 
parted spirits must be answered in the negative. Matt. 24, 36; 
Mark 13, 32. 

c. Divine wisdom (sapientia) is that attribute of God by which 
He disposes and ordains all things in a most admirable manner for 
the attainment of His end, Job 12,13; 28, 20; Bom. 11, 33. God’s 
wisdom stands in close connection with His knowledge, so that the 
two often appear together (Eom. 11, 33: oocpiag xal yvcooecog; 
1 Cor. 12, 8: Xoyog oocpiag, loyoc yvwoecog). While the exact 
distinction between the two attributes is not clearly stated in 
Scripture, we may for all practical purposes distinguish between 
them as we do between intelligence and wisdom, so that oocpia 
denotes the practical application of yvcbocg. Scripture ascribes to 
God wisdom especially a) in the realm of nature (Ps. 104,24: 
creation and preservation) and b) in the realm of grace (1 Cor. 
2, 6ff.). Hence we should not criticize the wisdom of the only-wise 
God, 1 Tim. 1, 17; Eom. 16, 27, as Modernists and atheists do 
when they reject Scripture as the only source of truth and blas¬ 
pheme the divine method of creation (Mosaic creation report) and 
redemption (satisfactio vicaria), but we should rather admire and 
adore it, Eom. 11,33, with holy reverence and fear. 

d. Divine will (voluntas) has been treated by our dogmaticians 
sometimes as a separate attribute and sometimes as supplementary 
to the divine attribute of wisdom. In that case they deduce from 
the will of God the attributes of holiness, justice, truth, good¬ 
ness, etc. (Baier). The manner of treating the subject is imma¬ 
terial as long as the doctrine that is presented is Scriptural. 

As Scripture ascribes to God an intelligent mind (Eom. 11, 34: 
vovg ), so it ascribes to Him also will, 1 Tim. 2, 4; John 6, 40; 
1 Thess. 4, 3. The will of God is the divine essence itself, seeking 
that which is good and opposing that which is evil. As to the 
causes of the divine will (causae voluntatis divinae), Scripture 
describes God a) in His supreme majesty, as independent of any¬ 
thing outside Himself, or as absolutely sovereign in Himself, Eom. 
11, 36. Viewed in this manner, God is not moved by anything but 
by Himself; or we may say, in Him cause and effect coincide. 
Non sunt in Deo causae formaliter causantes. But Scripture 
speaks of God also b) from the viewpoint of human understanding; 
that is to say, since God in His divine essence is unintelligible 
to us, it leads us to distinguish in Him between cause and effect 
and to regard Him as provoked to wrath by sin, Jer. 2, 19, 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


171 


and as moved to grace by Christ’s redemption, Rom. 3,24. In Deo 
sunt causae virtualiter causantes. It is only when we speak of 
God in this Scriptural way that we can properly distinguish be¬ 
tween Law and Gospel. 

Although there is but one will in God, which is identical with 
His divine essence (no contradictory wills), yet, on the basis of 
Scripture, we may distinguish between: — 

1. The first and the second divine will (voluntas prima, volun¬ 
tas secunda; voluntas antecedent, voluntas consequent). The first 
will of God (voluntas antecedent) is that by which He earnestly 
desires the salvation of all sinners, John 3,16.17; the second will 
(voluntas consequent) is that by which He judges and condemns 
all those who reject His grace in Christ Jesus, John 3,18. This 
distinction we hold against the double election of Calvinism, ac¬ 
cording to which God from eternity elected some to salvation and 
others to damnation. 

2. The irresistible and the resistible divine will (voluntas irre- 
sistibilis, voluntas resistibilis). God’s will is irresistible whenever 
it exerts itself absolutely, or whenever God acts in His absolute 
majesty and sovereignty (Creation, Final Judgment, 2 Cor. 5,10; 
Matt. 25, 31 ff.); it is resistible whenever it exerts itself through 
means (rejection of divine grace offered in the Gospel, Matt. 
23,37). However, neither this nor the first distinction must be 
abused in the interest of synergism. 

3. The absolute and the ordinate divine mil (voluntas abso- 
luta, voluntas ordinata). God’s absolute will exerts itself without 
means, John 2,1—11; Luke 1,15; the ordinate will exerts itself 
through means (conversion through the means of grace, Rom. 
10,17; Titus 3, 5; 1 Pet. 1, 23ff.; Mark 16,15; Matt. 28,19. 20). 
To reject the divinely ordained means of grace means to espouse 
the error of enthusiasm. 

4. The gracious will and the conditional divine will (voluntas 
gratiae, voluntas conditionata). The gracious will of God exerts 
itself in the salvation of men, for He desires that all men should 
be saved by grace, through faith, without the deeds of the Law, or 
good works, Rom. 3, 28; Eph. 2, 8. 9; Rom. 11, 6; Gal. 3, lOf.; the 
conditional will of God is that by which He demands perfect obe¬ 
dience of all who would be saved by the Law, Gal. 2,12; 3,10. 
Since the Fall no man can be saved by the deeds of the Law; the 
conditional will of God after the Fall is therefore a stern reproof 
of the folly of attempting salvation by works, Luke 10, 28. 



172 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


5. The revealed and the hidden divine will (voluntas revelata, 
signi; voluntas absconcUta, beneplaciti) . The revealed will of 
God embraces the entire revelation of Scripture, 1 Cor. 2,12—16; 
the hidden will of God includes all things which He has left un¬ 
revealed in His Word, Rom. 11, 33. 34. While we should diligently 
study the revealed will of God in Holy Scripture, the attempt to 
explore His hidden will must be condemned as both foolish and 
arrogant. 

e. Divine holiness (sanctitas) is that attribute of God by which 
He, conformably to His own Law, desires all things that are right 
and good, Deut. 32, 4; Ps. 92,15; Lev. 11, 44; 1 Pet. 1,15. In 
particular, God is holy a) essentially, inasmuch as He is by His 
divine essence most supremely exalted over all creatures, in which 
sense holiness denotes God’s supreme majesty and comprises all 
His other attributes, Is. 6, 3; John 12, 41; b) efficiently, inasmuch 
as He is the Author of all holiness and stands in direct opposition 
to sin, 1 Pet. 1,16; Lev. 11, 44. 45. The holiness of God should 
move us to appear before Him with great reverence, Gen. 18,27; 
Ex. 3, 5, and, at the same time, with great boldness and confidence, 
since Christ by His vicarious atonement has made peace between 
the Holy God and sinful man, Rom. 5,1; 5,10; Eph. 3,11.12. 

f. Divine justice (iustitia) is that attribute of God by which 
He is perfectly just and righteous in His divine essence, Ps. 92,15, 
and by which He, in conformity with His own perfect, righteous 
essence, demands of men that which is just, Hos. 14, 9; Ps. 1, 5. 6. 
Hollaz fitly defines the justice of God as follows: “Justice is 
a divine attribute by virtue of which God wishes and does all those 
things which are conformed to His eternal Law, Ps. 92,15, pre¬ 
scribes suitable laws to creatures, Ps. 19, 7, fulfils His promises 
made to men. Is. 45, 23, rewards the good, Rom. 2, 5—7; 2 Thess. 
1,6.7, and punishes the wicked, Ps. 119,137; Rom. 1,32; Acts 
17,31; 2 Thess. 1, 6; Rom. 3, 8. 19.” Since God is God, He is 
exlex, that is, He is not under the Law, but is Himself the perfect 
norm of justice. Deus iustus est, quia omnia suae legi conformiter 
vult aut facit. 

The justice of God, applied to men, is a) iustitia legalis, or 
the divine righteousness revealed in the Law, and b) iustitia evan- 
gelica, or the divine righteousness revealed in the Gospel, which 
has been secured for sinners through Christ’s vicarious atonement. 
The iustitia legaiis may again be described as a) legislatoria, in¬ 
asmuch as it is the norm of human righteousness, Matt. 22, 37ff.; 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


173 


b) remuneratoria, inasmuch as it rewards the good, 2 Tim. 4, 8; 
and c) vindicativa (punitiva, ultrix), inasmuch as it punishes the 
evil, 2 Thess. 1, 4—10. The iustitia evangelica is the essence of 
the Christian religion, since upon it the salvation of man rests. 
The question whether God, according to His iustitia vindicativa, 
punishes sin adequately must be answered in the affirmative. 

g. Divine veracity (veracitas) is that attribute of God by 
which He is unfailing in speaking the truth and keeping His 
promises, Num. 23,19; Heb. 6,18 ; Deut. 32, 4. The revelation of 
this attribute implies a peculiar condescension on the part of God, 
since man through unbelief doubts both the threats of the Law and 
the promises of the Gospel, Ps. 90, 11; Is. 53, 1; John 12, 38. 
Just because of human unbelief, God has graciously revealed to us 
that, while all men are liars, Ps. 116,11; Eom. 3, 4, He Himself 
is Truth, Titus 1, 2; John 3, 33; Heb. 6,18; Matt. 24, 35; John 
10, 35. In view of God’s veracity we should fear His wrath, Gal. 
6, 7, and trust in His promises, Eom. 10,11; Titus 1, 2. 

h. Divine power (potentia) is that attribute of God by which 
He can accomplish everything that can possibly be done without 
implying any contradiction in His divine essence. Quenstedt de¬ 
fines the power of God (1, 293) thus: “Power is that by which 
God independently, through the eternal activity of His own essence, 
can do absolutely everything that does not involve a contradiction.” 
( Doctr. Theol., p. 120.) God’s perfect power is distinguished from 
the imperfect and relative power of man both with regard to 
manner and extent; for, with regard to the first, God’s power is 
His will, Gen. 1, 3; Ps. 115, 3 (Deus producit volendo), while, with 
regard to the second. His power embraces all things that are in 
conformity with His perfect essence, Matt. 19, 26; Luke 1, 37. 
Because God has infinite power, we must not speak of Him as if He 
had exhausted Himself when creating this universe (pantheism). 
Xor must we conclude from God’s power what in our estimation 
He ought to do. Thus the conclusion of rationalistic theologians 
that, since God is almighty, He ought to forgive sin without 
Christ’s vicarious suffering and death is a blasphemy. 

God exerts His power in two ways, namely: a) by means 
(causae secundae) and b) without means. The first is God’s ordi¬ 
nate power (potentia ordinata) ; the second is His absolute power 
(potentia absoluta, immediata). In both instances the same al¬ 
mighty power is brought into action, Ps. 33, 6—9. Whenever God 
works absolutely what ordinarily He accomplishes by means, 



174 


THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


we are confronted with miracles (John 2 ,11: orjjuEia; Acts 2,43: 
t egaza xai orjpela). With respect to miracles we must hold, on 
the basis of Scripture, a) that God can perform miracles when¬ 
ever He pleases, since He is the sovereign Lord and the laws of 
nature, which in themselves are never invariable (evolutionists), 
are nothing else than His own divine will applied to the things 
created; but b) that we should use the divinely ordained means, 
both in the realm of nature and of grace, and not presumptuously 
demand miracles on our behalf, Luke 11,16; Matt. 12, 39. The 
fides heroica, which with extraordinary confidence in God performs 
miracles, is not judged by this rule; but let the person who en¬ 
deavors to perform miracles be sure that his “faith” is really -fides 
heroica and not presumption. 

The denial of God’s omnipotence on the ground that He can¬ 
not lie, steal, die, etc., must be condemned as blasphemous sophistry. 
Sunt sophismata, quibus definitio rei tollitur. 

i. Divine goodness (bonitas) in its objective sense is that attri¬ 
bute of God by which His divine essence is perfectly conformed to 
His divine will, or His absolute perfection. Matt. 19,17. Kelatively 
also the creatures of God are good, Gen. 1, 31, even after the 
Fall, namely, inasmuch as they are creatures of God, 1 Tim. 4,4. 
However, creatures possess no essential goodness, or perfection, 
but are good only as God’s handiwork. In contradistinction to 
all creatures, God alone is good, or good in and of Himself 
(id avxoayaddv). Gerhard writes of God’s goodness in this sense: 
“Deus est vere bonus et solus bonus et omnis bonitatis causa.” 
The Scriptural truth that God alone is absolutely and in Himself 
good (essential Goodness) and that men are only relatively, or 
dependently, good should preserve us from pride and envy and 
move us to humility and gratitude, 1 Cor. 4, 7; 1 Pet. 2, 1. 
Gerhard writes: “All good things come down upon us and our 
neighbor from God; who is envious of his neighbor opposes God 
Himself, the Giver of all gifts, and is truly a dedpayog (a God- 
fighter).” 

While divine goodness in its objective sense denotes the abso¬ 
lute divine perfection, or the divine essential goodness, in its sub¬ 
jective sense it denotes His gracious disposition and conduct toward 
His creatures, Ps. 145, 9; 36, 6. 7. According to Scripture, God is 
good a) in general, to all creatures, Ps. 136; b) in particular, to 
all men. Matt. 5,45; c) more especially, to men as sinners, John 
3,16; and d) in a most special sense, to His believing saints, Bom. 



THE DOCTRINE OF GOD. 


175 


8,28; 1 Cor. 2, 9; Deut. 33, 3; John 16,27. God’s goodness 
toward us should always move us to grateful love to Him, 

1 John 4,19. 

Under the attribute of divine goodness (bonitas relativa), we 
may group a) divine grace, as goodness unmerited by men, Titus 
3, 5; Bom. 3, 24; b) divine mercy, as goodness toward men in 
need, Luke 1, 78. 79; c) divine love, as goodness desiring com¬ 
munion with men, John 3, 16; d) divine patience and long- 
suffering, as goodness waiting for man’s repentance, 1 Pet. 3, 20; 

2 Pet. 3, 9. These attributes deserve consideration above all others, 
for they are the true scope of Scripture and the great theme in 
which Christian preaching centers, 1 Cor. 2, 2. The entire Gospel- 
message may be summed up in the divine attribute of goodness, for 
what it proclaims is nothing else than the manifestation of divine 
grace, love, mercy, long-suffering, friendliness, etc., in Christ Jesus, 
our Lord, 1 John 4, 9. The revelation of all other divine attributes 
would be dreadful indeed were it not for God’s goodness in Christ. 
But as God is good, so those who through faith in Christ have 
become His dear children should likewise be good, gracious, mer¬ 
ciful, Luke 6, 36; Matt. 5, 44. 45; Eph. 4, 32; Col. 3,12. 

God’s goodness has been objected to on the ground that His 
punishments are frequently severe and destructive. While Scrip¬ 
ture does not deny this fact. Matt. 24, 21. 22, it points out the great 
truth that even God’s dire punishments are motivated by His saving 
love; for by them He calls sinners to repentance, Luke 13,1—3. 
However, all who deny the Bible as the only source of faith, the 
Triune God as the only true God, and Christ as the only Savior 
from sin can never hope to share in the eternal blessings of God’s 
goodness, grace, and love.

THE DOCTRINE OP DIVINE DECREES. 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE DIVINE DECREES. 

(De Decretis Divinis.) 

The acts of God are divided into two kinds, internal (opera 
■ad intra), and external (opera ad extra), the latter being either 
immediate (performed without instrumental causes) or mediate 
(performed through intermediate causes). 

The internal acts, or operations, of God are again of two 
kinds, personal and essential. The personal internal acts of God 
terminate within the Godhead and pertain to the divine Persons 
by whom they are performed as peculiar to such Persons (genera¬ 
tion and spiration). The essential internal acts of God also termi¬ 
nate within the Godhead, but in them the three Persons of the 
Trinity concur. These essential internal operations of God are 
called the eternal decrees of God. Of these there are three: a) the 
decree of creation, b) the decree of redemption, and c) the decree 
of predestination. 

a. The decree of creation is that essential internal act of the 
Triune God “by which He purposed to create in the beginning of 
time heaven and earth and all creatures, for the manifestation of 
His wisdom, goodness, and power” (A. L. Graebner). The decree 
of creation is taught in Job 28,26.27; Acts 15,18; Gen. 1,26; 
Acts 17,26; Ps. 136,5—9. 

b. The decree of redemption is that essential internal act of 
the Triune God by which He most graciously and wisely purposed 
to redeem fallen and lost mankind through the vicarious atonement 
of the incarnate Son of God, Jesus Christ, and thus to prepare 
a way of salvation for the whole world, whose fall He had fore¬ 
seen, but not decreed. The decree of redemption is taught in 
Acts 2, 23: “Delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowl¬ 
edge of God”; Acts 4,28: “To do whatsoever Thy counsel deter¬ 
mined before to be done”; Eph. 1, 7—10: “In whom we have re¬ 
demption through His blood, . . . according to the riches of His 
grace; wherein He hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and 
prudence . . . according to His good pleasure which He hath pur¬ 
posed in Himself”; 1 Pet. 1, 20: “Who [the incarnate Son of God, 
our Redeemer] verily was foreordained before the foundation of the 
world”; Gal. 4, 4. 5: “When the fulness of time was come, God 
sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the Law, to 
redeem them that were under the Law”; John 3, 16: “God so 
loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son,” etc. 



THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE DECREES. 


177 


c. The decree of predestination is that essential internal act 
of the Triune God by which He from eternity, moved only by His 
grace and the redemption of Jesus Christ, purposed to sanctify and 
save by faith, through the means of grace, all saints who finally 
enter into life eternal. The decree of predestination is taught in 
Eph. 1, 4: “He has chosen us in Him [Christ] before the founda¬ 
tion of the world”; 2 Thess. 2, 13: “God hath from the beginning 
chosen you to salvation”; Eph. 3,11: “According to the eternal 
purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus, our Lord”; 2 Tim. 
1,9: “Who hath saved us . . . according to His own purpose and 
grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began”; 
Rom. 11, 5: “There is a remnant according to the election of 
grace”; Acts 13,48: “As many as were ordained to eternal life 
believed”; Rom. 8, 29. 30: “Whom He did foreknow He also did 
predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son. . . . Whom 
He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, 
them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also 
glorified”; 1 Pet. 1, 2 : “Elect according to the foreknowledge of 
God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience 
and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ”; Matt. 22,14: “Many 
are called, but few are chosen”; Mark 13, 20. 22 : “For the elect’s 
sake, whom He hath chosen. He hath shortened the days ... to 
seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.” 

The doctrine of election will be treated at greater length under 
its proper head. Here we refer to it only inasmuch as it belongs 
to the eternal decrees of God. But in passing, we may say that 
from the eternal decree of predestination there must be excluded 
every form of synergism (denial of the sola gratia) and every 
form of Calvinism (denial of the gratia universalis). For this 
reason we affirm a) God did not choose the elect in view of their 
faith (intuitu fidei), and b) God did not predestinate any one to 
damnation, but earnestly desires all men to be saved (vocatio 
seria). The apparent discrepancy between particular election 
(electio particularis) and universal grace (gratia universalis) we 
acknowledge as a mystery, which is indeed beyond reason, but which 
we should neither criticize nor try to explain. All attempts to 
harmonize the two doctrines have resulted either in synergism (the 
elect were chosen in view of their better conduct, which is opposed 
to Rom. 3, 22. 23) or in Calvinism (God does not desire to save all, 
which is opposed to John 3,16; 2 Cor. 5,19. 20; 2 Pet. 3, 9; Acts 
17, 30; 1 Tim. 4, 2). The Formula of Concord rightly says: 

CHRISTIAN DOCMATIC8. 12 



178 


THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE DECREES. 


“However, since God has reserved this mystery for His wisdom and 
has revealed nothing to us concerning it in His Word, much less 
commanded us to investigate it with our thoughts, but has earnestly 
discouraged us therefrom, Rom. 11, 33 ff., we should not reason in 
our thoughts, draw conclusions, nor inquire curiously into these 
matters, but should adhere to His revealed Word, to which He 
points us.” (Thor. Decl., XI, 55.) 

Dr. A. L. Graebner summarizes the decree of predestination as 
follows: “The decree of predestination is an eternal act of God 
(Eph. 1,4; 3,11; 2 Tim. 1, 9; 2 Thess. 2,13), who for His goods- 
ness’ sake (2 Tim. 1, 9; Rom. 9, 11; 11, 5) and because of the 
merit of the foreordained Redeemer of all mankind (Eph. 1, 4; 
3,11) purposed to lead into everlasting life (Acts 13,48; 2 Tim. 
2,10; Rom. 8, 28. 29), by the way and means of salvation desig¬ 
nated for all mankind (Eph. 1, 4. 5; 1 Pet. 1, 2), a certain number 
(Acts 13,48; Matt. 20,16; 22,14) of certain persons (2 Tim. 
2,19; John 13,18) and to procure, work, and promote what would 
pertain to their final salvation (Rom. 8, 30; Eph. 1,11; 3,10.11; 
Mark 13, 20. 22).” ( Outlines of Doctrinal Theology, § 51.) 



THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 


17ft 


THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 

(De Creations.) 


1. DEFINITION OF CREATION. 

In contradistinction to pagan pantheism, which regards the 
universe as an emanation from, or a manifestation of, God, so that 
God and the universe are identical, and to pagan dualism, which 
assumes the eternal existence of matter (vXrj afiogrpoq, to fir} ov)> 
fashioned by a deity {yovs, to ov) into this present world, Holy 
Scripture teaches that the Triune God created all things that exist 
outside Himself, i. e., the universe, out of nothing. By “nothing”' 
we do not mean any already existing matter (nihil positivum), 
but a state of non-existence (nihil negativum). From Gen. 1,1, 
Heb. 11, 3, and Bom. 4,17 we learn that before the creation of the 
world nothing existed but God Himself. Calov writes (III, 899): 
“Creation does not consist in emanation from the essence of God, 
nor in generation, nor in motion, or natural change, . . . but in 
outward action, by which through infinite power things are pro¬ 
duced from nothing.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 164 f.) Gerhard says 
(IV, 7): “Away with the dreams of the Stoics, who devised two 
eternal principles, vove and vXrj, mind, or God, and matter, which, 
they imagined, during the ages of eternity was a confused chaos 
and at a certain time was at length brought into form by ‘mind/ ” 
(Ibid.) Against pantheism, both ancient and modern, Hollaz 
writes thus: “Creation is a free divine action, because God framed 
the universe, not induced thereto by necessity, as though He 
needed the services of creatures, . . . but freely, as He was able 
to create or not, to create and to frame sooner or later, in this or 
in another matter.” (Ibid.) The question why God did not create 
the world sooner Hafenreffer describes as a “question of madmen 
curiously inquiring into such things as are of no profit.” (Ibid.) 

2. THE ORDER OF CREATION. 

According to Holy Scripture, God did not create all things 
“at once, but gradually, observing an admirable order” (ordo crea- 
tionis). As the first chapter of Genesis affirms, God, in creating 
all things, proceeded from the lower to the higher, until He finally 
made man as the crown of His creative work. In general, the work 
of creation comprises three steps: a) the production, on the first 
day, of the crude material, “which was the germinal source, as it 
were, of the entire universe” (Quenstedt); Luther: moles coeli ei 
terrae; b) the separation and disposition of simple creatures dur- 



180 


THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 


ing the first three days (light on the first day; the firmament on 
the second; the separation of the earth from the waters on the 
third); c) the furnishing and completion of the world, which was 
brought to perfection in three more days (the celestial bodies on 
the fourth day; the fish and fowl on the fifth; the creation of 
land animals and of man on the sixth). 

We thus distinguish between immediate and mediate creation, 
the former being the creation of the moles coeli et terrae out of 
nothing and the latter the arrangement of the previously created 
material. 

This order of creation must, however, not be interpreted as 
an evolutionary process; for according to Scripture the world was 
not developed by forces resident in matter itself, but by the creative 
power of God. (Gen. 1, 1: “God created”; v. 3: “God said.”) 
The creatures thus came into existence through the omnipotent 
command of the personal, transmundane Creator. This truth our 
dogmaticians have expressed by the statement: “The efficient cause 
of creation is God, and He alone” (Calov). Nor can experimental 
science gainsay it, since it can prove neither a development of 
organic things from inorganic (generatio aequivoca) nor a develop¬ 
ment of higher forms from the lower (Deszendenztheorie; Trans- 
mutationshypothese). 

Evolution must be rejected as untenable even on rational 
grounds, a) since it does not account for the existence of primeval 
matter and b) since it rests upon a principle disproved by nature, 
namely, on the supposed transmutation of the homogeneous into 
the heterogeneous (transmutation of species). Scripture, on the 
other hand, accords with reason in the following points: a) the 
creation of all things by an omnipotent God; b) the orderly pro¬ 
cedure in the work of creation; c) the propagation of creatures 
after their kind, Gen. 1,21. As all creatures came into existence 
through the creative command of God, so they are preserved and 
propagated through the divine omnipotent will, Acts 17, 28. The 
existence of the universe to-day with all its manifold creatures is 
due to the blessing which God pronounced upon the whole creation 
after the completion of His creative work, Gen. 1,22; Col. 1,17. 

3. THE HEXAEMERON. 

Holy Scripture teaches distinctly that the whole universe was 
created within six days of twenty-four hours each (hexaemeron). 
To change the six days into a mere moment (Athanasius, Augus- 



THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 


181 


tine, Hilary) or to expand them into periods of millions of years 
is equally contrary to Scripture. (Gen. 1, 31; 2,2; Ex. 20, 9.11: 
“Six days shalt thou labor. . . . For in six days the Lord made 
heaven and earth.”) Since the Mosaic creation record is the only 
authentic report which we have of the miracle of creation (no man 
was present at the creation, and no one can show from the now 
existing world how it once sprang into existence), we must regard 
every attempt to correct or supplement the record of Genesis as 
unscientific pretense. Evolution proper is atheistic and immoral, 
while theistic evolution is neither in accord with Scripture nor 
with the basic principles of evolution proper. To deny the inspired 
character of the Book of Genesis means to contradict the testimony 
of the divine, omniscient Christ, who accepted also this book as 
canonical, Matt. 19,4—6; John 5,39. 

4. THE SIX DAYS OF CREATION CONSIDERED IN DETAIL. 

The First Day. — The expression “In the beginning” (rp^tna) 
means as much as “when this world began to be.” “There was no 
material of creation (materia ex qua) with respect to the things 
created on the first day” (Quenstedt). Only since things outside 
God have begun to exist, there is a beginning. Before that there 
was no “beginning,” because God has no beginning, Ps. 90,1. 2, 
and outside Him there was nothing. Time and space must there¬ 
fore be traced to God’s omnipotent fiat of creation; they are crea¬ 
tures of the infinite God. The words “In the beginning,” Gen. 1,1, 
correspond to the same words (iv &Qxfi) i n John 1, 1; only the 
Book of Genesis records what God then did, while the Gospel of 
John informs us who existed in the beginning (the Father and 
the Son). 

The expression “heaven and earth” is a Scriptural designa¬ 
tion of the universe (das Weltall), or the “all” (ra Jiavxa), of which 
St. Paul speaks in Col. 1,17 and Acts 17, 24: “the world and all 
things therein.” However, since the divine record in Genesis de¬ 
scribes in detail the creation of the various creatures out of the 
original substance (mediate creation), we rightly understand the 
expression to denote the rudis moles coeli et terrae, or the crude 
material, which was the “germinal source of the entire universe.” 
Together with the earth, God created the water, since this sur¬ 
rounded the earth, Gen. 1,2. 

The term heaven must not be taken in the sense of a “highest 
heaven” (empyrean, coelum empyrium), a supposed region of 



182 


THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 


pure fire, in which God dwells with the angels and saints (papists, 
Calvinists). Quenstedt rightly calls this supposed empyrean 
a merum figmentum. The expression heaven and earth in Gen. 1,1 
(H«n nto D’otfn n«), as just stated, simply denotes the Weltstoff, 
to borrow a term of modern dogmatics. 

The term tohuvabohu (*ri3) *nn), which our Authorized Ver¬ 
sion translates "without form and void,” in Jer. 4, 23 denotes 
a desolate country. In Gen. 1, 2, however, it denotes the chaotic 
condition of all created things before God’s creative hand had 
separated and arranged them in order. The theory that Gen. 1,1 
reports the restitution of a world previously created, but destroyed 
at the fall of the evil angels (Kurtz), has no Scriptural foundation 
whatever and must be rejected as a figment of human speculation. 

The "light,” which God created on the first day, was the ele¬ 
mental light, to which He on the fourth day added the “two great 
lights in the firmament” to govern day and night, summer and 
winter, seed-time and harvest, Gen. 1,14. According to Scripture, 
light existed before the celestial bodies. “By the word of His power 
God created light, elemental light, brought it into being in the 
midst of the darkness, and commanded it to shine out of darkness, 
2 Cor. 4, 6. Ever since the first day of the world the regular re¬ 
currence of darkness and light marks the period of one day, as 
we now divide it into twenty-four hours.” (Kretzmann, Pop. 
Com., I, 2.) 

The Second Day. — On the second day, God created the ex¬ 
pansion, or the "firmament” (y'P'i), by which is meant not the 
stratum of atmosphere above the earth, but rather the visible vault 
of the sky (Luther). According to Gen. 1,6—8 the "firmament” 
divides the waters above and those below it, so that we must con¬ 
ceive of waters beyond the visible vault of the sky. The creation 
report everywhere exhibits God’s omnipotent power and majesty, 
but does not answer all questions which the ever-curious mind of 
man is inclined to put. 

The Third Day. — On the third day, God gathered the waters 
under the heaven together unto one place, so that the dry land 
appeared. “God here finished His creative work on inanimate 
matter, when His almighty command bade the waters from below 
the heavens, below the firmament which He had constructed, be 
gathered together into a single place, by themselves. In chaos the 
mixture of solids and liquids had been so complete as to preclude 
the designation ‘dry land.’ But now the solids and liquids were to 



THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 


183 


be separated, so that dry land as we know it was visible.” (Kretz- 
mann. Pop. Corn., I, 2.) As soon as God caused the dry land to 
appear, He adorned it “with grass and herb yielding seed after 
his kind and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after 
his kind,” Gen. 1, 12 (the law of propagation). According to 
Scripture the plants were before the seed, since God created mature 
plants, “yielding seed.” 

The Fourth Day. — On the fourth day, God created the sun, 
moon, and stars, Gen. 1,14ff. The “matter out of which” (materia 
ex qua) God made the celestial bodies is not stated; but the holy 
writer describes their purpose (finis cuius) and the recipients 
(finis cui) of their blessings, Gen. 1,14—18. While Holy Scrip¬ 
ture does not teach an astronomical system, nevertheless it stresses 
the following truths: a) The earth was before the sun, just as also 
the light was before the sun. b) The earth does not serve the sun, 
but, vice versa, the sun serves the earth, and both the sun and the 
earth serve man, who has been created for the purpose of serving 
God. Within the bounds of these basic truths all astronomical ideas 
of the Christian theologian must be confined. All so-called astro¬ 
nomical systems suggested by men rest upon hypotheses, which are 
beyond positive proof. Over against the astronomical systems of 
scientists the Christian theologian must therefore maintain: 
a) Scripture never errs, not even in matters of science, John 10, 35; 
2 Tim. 3,16. b) Scripture accommodates itself to human concep¬ 
tions, but never to human errors, since it is always truth, John 
17,17. c) We know so little concerning astronomical data that it 
is both foolish and unscientific to supplement, correct, or criticize 
Scripture on the basis of human speculative systems, d) It is 
unworthy of our Christian calling to discard the inerrant Word of 
Scripture in favor of the “assured results” of science falsely so 
called. Hence in a controversy on this point a Christian must 
always maintain the divine authority of Scripture. But he must 
not believe that by convincing an unbeliever of the truth of the 
Mosaic narrative he may convert him, since conversion is accom¬ 
plished only through the preaching of the Law and the Gospel. 

The Fifth Day. — On the fifth day, God created “the moving 
creature that hath life” in the water and the “fowl that may fly 
above the earth,” Gen. 1, 20. 21. While the materia ex qua of the 
first was water, that of the second is not stated directly. Neverthe¬ 
less the matter out of which these and other creatures were made

was in no wise self-creative (evolution). Materia est principium 
passivum ; non concurrit cum Deo ad aliquid creandum. 

The Sixth Day. — On the last day, God created both “the 
beasts of the earth” and, as the crown of His creative work, man, 
Gen. 1, 24. 27. The question whether animals and plants which 
after the Fall have become injurious to man were created at this 
time may be answered as follows: They were indeed created within 
the six creation days, but their functions were in complete accord 
with man’s well-being. Even to-day the “harmful things” (poi¬ 
sonous plants and minerals) may be used by man for his benefit. 
However, since before the Fall nature was not yet under the curse 
and corruption of sin, even these creatures yielded to man their 
willing service. 

The supreme glory of man, as the crown of creation, appears 
from the following facts: a) Man’s creation was preceded by 
a divine consultation in which the three Persons of the Godhead 
concurred, Gen. 1, 26. b) While all creatures came into existence 
through the almighty divine word, God formed the body of man 
out of the dust of the ground, Gen. 2, 7, and breathed into his 
nostrils the breath of life, so that he became a living soul, 
Gen. 2, 7 b. c) God made man an intelligent and rational being 
to rule in His stead over the world, which was created for him by 
the beneficent Creator, Gen. 2, 7b; 1,28. d) God made man in 
His own image, so that he was like God in holiness, righteousness, 
and wisdom, Eph. 4, 24; Col. 3,10. e) God supplied Adam with 
a helpmeet, who was made in the divine image and endowed with 
intelligence and an immortal soul, Gen. 2, 22—24. 

The question of dichotomy or trichotomy must be decided on 
the basis of such passages as describe man according to his essential 
parts. Matt. 10, 28; 16, 26; Gen. 2, 7. On the basis of these pas¬ 
sages most Lutheran dogmaticians have declared themselves in 
favor of dichotomy. Passages quoted by trichotomists are Luke 1, 
46. 47; 1 Thess. 5, 23, etc.; but none of these furnishes incontro¬ 
vertible evidence in proof of trichotomy. That Scripture uses the 
terms spirit ( nvEvjua ) and soul (yvxy) interchangeably is clear from 
the fact that those who have departed this life are called either 
spirits (1 Pet. 3, 19), or souls (Rev. 6, 9). Dichotomy certainly 
offers less difficulty in explaining the phenomena of human exis¬ 
tence in general. 

The Mosaic narrative of the creation of the world must not 
be regarded as an allegory or myth, but must be taken as a true 



THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION.

historical account of actual happenings. Only a literal interpre¬ 
tation is fair to the text. 

According to Holy Scripture, creation was that free act of 
the Triune God by which “in the beginning, for His own glory. 
He made, without the use of preexisting materials, the whole visible 
and invisible universe” (Strong). This doctrine stands in close 
relation to God’s holiness and benevolence, Rom. 8, 20—23; 2 Cor. 
4, 16—17, as well as to His wisdom and free will, Ps. 104, 24; 
136, 5. Those who deny the doctrine of creation as taught in 
Scripture may as well deny also the Scriptural doctrine of redemp¬ 
tion, since the account of the former is no less inspired than is the 
account of the latter. "All Scripture is given by inspiration of 
God,” 2 Tim. 3,16, and Christ’s command is to accept as divine 
truth the whole Bible, John 5, 39; 10, 35. 

5. THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN RACE. 

On the basis of Scripture we maintain that Adam, created by 
God on the sixth day of the hexaemeron, was the first of all men 
and the parent of the entire human race throughout the whole 
world, 1 Cor. 15, 45. 47; Gen. 2, 5; Acts 17, 26; Rom. 5, 12. 
Hence we reject the error of Isaac Peyrere (1655), who taught 
that, while the Jews descended from Adam, Gen. 2, 7 ff., the Gen¬ 
tiles came from preadamites, Gen. 1, 26if., so that they date back 
to ages before the creation of the ancestor of the Jews. But the 
Mosaic narrative allows the assumption neither of preadamites nor 
of coadamites, since it teaches most emphatically that Adam is the 
parent of all men. Acts 17, 26. With this doctrine agree also the 
conclusions of outstanding anthropologists, who, on grounds apart 
from divine revelation, have affirmed the unity of the human race 
(Alexander von Humboldt). 

While Adam was created first and independently, Gen. 2,18, 
Eve was created dependency from Adam, a complete rational indi¬ 
vidual, taken from man according to soul and body, Gen. 2, 21—24. 
The rib from which God built (nJ3) Eve, must not be understood 
as a mere rib, but as a living, vital substance, including everything 
of which she consisted essentially, Gen. 2, 23; Acts 17, 26. (Cp. Lu¬ 
ther’s explanation, St. L., I, 157.) While Eve was Adam’s equal 
in the enjoyment of the divine blessings, both temporal and spir¬ 
itual, her social status was one of subordination to Adam, for 
whose sake she was created, Gen. 2,18; 1 Cor. 14, 34—36; 1 Tim. 
2,11—15. 



186 


THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 


6. SPECIAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CREATION 

REPORT. 

a. While Holy Scripture informs us exactly how and when man 
was created, it gives us no account whatever concerning the crea¬ 
tion of the angels. Nevertheless they, too, were made within the 
hexaemeron, Gen. 2,1. 2. Since Scripture reveals to us everything 
that is necessary for salvation, we should not try to supplement the 
divine record by human speculation. 

b. Whether Moses received the facts recorded in his narrative 
by immediate revelation or through oral tradition is immaterial. 
Since the Book of Genesis is canonical, it is divinely inspired, 
2 Tim. 3,16; John 10,35, and therefore contains God’s own ac¬ 
count concerning the beginning of the world and the human race. 

c. The two creation narratives of Genesis (chaps. 1 and 2) are 
not contradictory records (Jean Astruc, f 1766), but chap. 2 rather 
supplements the account of chap. 1. In Gen. 1 we have a general 
description of the work of creation, while Gen. 2 brings the fact of 
creation in relation to the history of God’s Church in the Old 
Testament. For this reason Gen. 2 is both supplementary and ex¬ 
planatory. (Cp. in Gen. 1; and nirr in Gen. 2.) The 
history of the Church of God, the Creator (D’ii^K), which is begun 
in Gen. 2, is therefore narrated as that of the Church of Jehovah 
(nirr), the eternal Lord of His people. 

d. As the soul of Eve was produced by propagation from Adam, 
so, it is generally held among Lutheran dogmaticians, the souls of 
children are produced by propagation rather than by direct crea¬ 
tion (traducianism, not creationism). “The soul of the first man 
was immediately created by God; but the soul of Eve was produced 
by propagation, and the souls of the rest of men are created not 
daily, . . . but by virtue of the divine blessing are propagated, per 
traducem, by their parents.” (Quenstedt.) Traducianism is in¬ 
ferred : a) from the primeval blessing of God, Gen. 1, 28; 9,1; 
b) from God’s rest and cessation from all work on the seventh day, 
Gen. 2, 2; c) from the production of the soul of Eve, Gen. 2, 
21.22; d) from the general description of generation, Gen. 5, 3; 
e) from Ps. 51, 5, etc. 

e. The act of creation must be regarded as a free act of God 
(actio libera), so that God was not compelled to create the world 
by any inner necessity of His divine essence, Ps. 115, 3. To say 
that the act of creation was a necessary divine act (actio necessaria) 
would be tantamount to pantheism and nullify the very concept 
of a personal, sovereign God. 



THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 


187 


f. While Holy Scripture assures us that the universe as it came 
forth from the creative hand of God was “very good” (Gen. 1, 31: 

3iD) ) it would be folly to affirm that the world as created by 
God was the very best that God could have made (the “optimism” 
of Leibniz). We must judge this world by God’s own standards, 
as these are presented to us in His Word. For this reason we say 
that the world was very good in the sense that it accorded perfectly 
with the divine will or that it was just as God desired it to be. 

7. CREATION AN EXTERNAL ACT OF GOD 
(OPUS AD EXTRA). 

Creation, as an opus ad extra, is the work of the Triune God. 
Hence it is ascribed to the Father (1 Cor. 8, 6), to the Son (Heb. 
1,10; John 1,3; Col. 1,16), and to the Holy Ghost (Gen. 1,2; 
Ps. 33, 6). Yet, though the Three Persons of the Trinity con¬ 
curred in this work, the creative power, or omnipotence, to which 
the universe owes its existence, is numerically one (una numero 
potentia), so that we must not speak of three creators, but only of 
one, John 5,17. “Creation is an action of the one God. ... It is 
likewise an action of God alone, which neither ought to be, nor 
can be, ascribed to any creature.” (Chemnitz.) Nor must we speak 
of a distribution of the one divine power among the Three Persons, 
as if the Father performed a third, the Son a third, and the Holy 
Ghost a third of the creative work. Holy Scripture never distrib¬ 
utes the divine creative act among the Three Persons, though at 
times it appropriates it to a distinct divine person (cf. passages 
above). 

Again, when Scripture occasionally declares that all things 
were made by the Father through the Son or the Holy Ghost, 
Ps. 33, 6, this “must not be construed into any inequality of per¬ 
sons, as the Arians blasphemously asserted that the Son was God’s 
instrument in creation, just as the workman uses an ax” (Chem¬ 
nitz) ; but this mode of speaking rather indicates the mystery of 
the Holy Trinity, according to which the Son has His divine es¬ 
sence and divine power eternally from the Father and the Holy 
Ghost has His divine essence and divine power eternally from the 
Father and Son. 

Chemnitz rightly remarks respecting this point (Loci Theol., 
1,115) : “The prepositions (ano, did, lv) do not divide the nature, 
but express the properties of a nature that is on$ and uncon¬ 
founded.” Likewise Hollaz says: “The three Persons of the 
Godhead are not three associated causes, not three Authors of 



188 


THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 


creation, but one Cause, one Author of creation, one Creator.” 
Flacius: " Vox autem pee non significat hie instbumentum, bed 
pbimabiam causam.” Luther: "It is the way of Scripture to say: 
The world was made through Christ by the Father and in the 
Holy Ghost. ... It employs this manner of speaking to indicate 
that the Father has His divine essence not from the Son, but, 
vice versa, that the Son has it from the Father, He being the first 
and original Person in the Godhead. Hence it does not say that 
Christ has made the world through the Father, but that the Father 
made it through the Son, so that the Father remains the First 
Person, and from Him, yet through the Son, all things appear. 
So John says (John 1, 3): ‘All things were made by Him’; and 
in Col. 1,16 we read: ‘All things were created by Him and for 
Him’; and Eom. 11,36: ‘For of Him and through Him and to 
Him are all things.’” (St. L., XII, 157 ff.) Chemnitz adds this 
warning ( Loci Theol., I, 115): "We must not dispute too curi¬ 
ously concerning the distinction of Persons in the work of creation, 
but let us be content with the revelation that all things were created 
by the eternal Father, through the Son, while the Holy Ghost 
hovered over them. (Rom. 11, 36.)” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 162ff.) 

8. THE ULTIMATE END OF CREATION. 

According to Holy Scripture the ultimate end of creation is 
the glory of God; in other words, the world was created ultimately 
for God’s own sake, Prov. 16,4, or for His glory, Ps. 104, Iff. For 
this reason not only men, but all creatures are exhorted to praise 
God, Ps. 148. By His creation God manifested in particular: 
a) His goodness, Ps. 136; b) His power, Ps. 115; c) His wisdom, 
Ps. 19, Iff.; 104, 24; 136, 5. The objection offered here that it is 
an unworthy conception of God to regard Him as having made all 
things for His own glory is a) anti-Scriptural, since Holy Scrip¬ 
ture teaches this very truth, Rom. 11, 36; b) unreasonable, since it 
measures God by human standards; c) atheistic, since it dethrones 
God and puts man in His place; for if the world was not made 
primarily for God’s sake, then man himself must be the ultimate 
end of creation. However, while the ultimate end of creation is 
the glory of God, the intermediate end of creation is the benefit 
of man, Ps. 115,15.16. Quenstedt writes (I, 418): "God made 
all things for the sake of man, but man He made for His own 
sake, Ps. 115,16; 60,7.8.” Finis cuius creationis mundi gloria 
Dei; finis cui homo. Macrocosmus in gratiam microcosmi con- 
ditus est. 



THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 


189 


THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 

(De Providentia Dei.) 


1. DEFINITION OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 

As God has created the world, so He also sustains it and 
continually cares for all His creatures, particularly man. Just 
that is what we mean when we speak of God’s providence ( provi¬ 
dentia, TtQovoia, dioixrjaig). Augustine says: “God is not a work¬ 
man who, when he has completed his work, leaves it to itself and 
goes his way.” Gerhard: “God, the Creator of all, did not desert 
the work which He framed; but by His omnipotence up to the 
present time preserves it, and by His wisdom He rules and con¬ 
trols all things in it.” 

While the fact of divine providence may be known by men 
from the contemplation of nature, Rom. 1,19. 20; Acts 14,17, and 
of history. Acts 17, 26—28, Holy Scripture, because of the blind¬ 
ness and perverseness of the human mind, Is. 1, 2. 3, teaches it with 
great emphasis and much detail. Matt. 6, 25—32. Gerhard 
(IV, 52) writes: “The knowledge of divine providence sought 
from the book of nature is weak and imperfect, not from the fault 
of nature itself, but from that of our mind; but more certain and 
perfect is the knowledge of divine providence which is obtained 
from Scripture.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 174.) The Christian theo¬ 
logian regards Scripture as the only source (principium cogno- 
scendi) of also this doctrine. 

The providence of God manifests itself in particular: a) in 
His gracious preservation of all creatures (conservatio) ; b) in His 
gracious cooperation with all that occurs (concursus); c) in His 
gracious direction and government of the whole universe (guber- 
natio). We therefore distinguish as special acts of divine provi¬ 
dence : God’s preservation, Ps. 36, 6; God’s concurrence, Acts 
17, 28; and God’s government, Jer. 10, 23; Prov. 20, 24. A com¬ 
plete definition of divine providence therefore reads: “Divine 
providence is the external act of the entire Trinity (opus ad extra) 
whereby God a) most efficaciously upholds the things created, both 
as an entirety and singly, both in species and in individuals; 
b) concurs in their actions and effects; and c) freely and wisely 
governs all things to His own glory and the welfare and safety of 
the universe, especially of the godly.” 

The act of divine providence includes the preservation of all 



190 


THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 


creatures not only in their being. Acts 17, 28; Col. 1,17, but also 
in their activities, Matt. 5, 45; Acts 14,17; Ps. 104,10—30. In 
other words, the creatures have not only their being in God, but 
also perform their functions through Him. For this reason our 
dogmaticians have called the preservation of the world (conservatio 
mundi) a continuous creation (creatio continuata). Rightly under¬ 
stood, this expression is Scriptural. While divine providence is 
the work of the Triune God, it is of special comfort to all believers 
that Holy Scripture ascribes the preservation and government of 
the world especially to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom 
God has made the Head of His Church, Heb. 1, 3; Col. 1, 17; 
Eph. 1, 20—23. 

2. THE OBJECTS OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 

According to Holy Scripture divine providence embraces not 
only the universe in general, Col. 1,17, but also all creatures indi¬ 
vidually: a) plants, Matt. 6, 28—30; b) animals, Matt. 6, 26; 
c) men, Acts 17, 26; Ps. 33,12—15. The special object of divine 
providence according to Scripture is the Christian Church, for 
whose sake all things exist and whose welfare all must serve, Rom. 
8,28; Heb. 1,14; Matt. 16,18. All objections raised against the 
Scriptural truth that divine providence embraces all things, even 
the least, Matt. 10, 30; Luke 21,18; 12, 6, for example, that God 
would be too heavily burdened by caring for all things or that the 
small affairs of life in that case would receive undue emphasis in 
comparison with the important matters, must be rejected as per¬ 
verse notions of the carnal and unbelieving heart, which destroy 
the very concept of God; for just because God is God, does He 
care for all things, Acts 17, 28. 

3. THE RELATION OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE TO 
SECONDARY CAUSES (CAUSAE SECUNDAE). 

In His cooperating providence, God employs secondary causes 
(causae secundae), or means by which He preserves and directs 
the things which He has made. This is what we mean when we 
speak of divine concurrence. The relation of divine providence to 
such secondary means must be carefully noted; for in the divine 
act of concurrence both God works and the means (causae secun¬ 
dae ) work. However, the operation of the means is not coordinate 
with that of God, but rather subordinate to it, so that the secondary 
causes work only so far and so long as God works through them. 



THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 


191 


Ps. 127,1. To emphasize this truth, our dogmaticians have said 
that the divine concurrence is not previous (actio praevia), but 
the operation of God and that of the means is numerically one 
(una numero actio). In other words, God concurs, but He does 
not precur ; He cooperates, but does not “preoperate.” “Con¬ 
currence is not antecedent, but occurs when the action itself is 
produced.” (Hollaz.) Thus bread nourishes, medicine cures, water 
quenches thirst, etc., only because of God’s continuous influence 
upon His creatures (Dei continuus in creaturas influxus). It is 
for this reason that God is called the First Cause (causa prima) 
and the creature the second cause (causa secunda), though the 
action of God and that of the creature is simultaneous. This is 
the Scriptural doctrine of divine concurrence, which is as much 
opposed to deism as it is to pantheism. 

With respect to the laws of nature. Scripture teaches that they 
are not detached from the divine will, but are simply God’s will 
exerted in the being and action of the creatures in order that they 
may be preserved both in their existence and operation. Scripture 
acknowledges no immutable laws of nature apart from the divine 
will; for while they may be immutable to feeble man, they are not 
immutable to the omnipresent God, who by His almighty power 
governs all things according to His will, Ps. 115, 3; 135, 6. 

4. DIVINE CONCURRENCE IN GOOD AND EVIL ACTIONS. 

With respect to the divine concurrence in the actions of moral 
agencies (men, angels) a distinction must be made between good 
and evil acts. With regard to evil acts (sins) Scripture teaches 
a) that God in His perfect holiness is so unalterably opposed to 
every evil work that He absolutely forbids and condemns it 
(Decalog); b) that God frequently prevents evil acts from occur¬ 
ring, Gen. 20, 6; and c) that, whenever He permits them to happen. 
He so controls them that they must serve His wise and holy pur¬ 
poses, Gen. 50, 20; Rom. 8, 28. Nevertheless the question remains: 
“How does God cooperate in evil actions that actually do occur?” 
On the one hand, we cannot say that these acts are done without 
God, for this would deny His divine concurrence (atheism); on the 
other hand, however, we must not ascribe to God these acts in so 
far as they are evil (pantheism). In other words, the divine con¬ 
currence makes God neither the author of, nor an accomplice in, 
evil acts. 

The difficulty is satisfactorily removed if we bear in mind the 



192 


THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 


dividing-line which Scripture here suggests; for while it is true 
that God concurs in evil acts, He concurs in them only in so far 
as they are acts (quoad materiale), not in so far as they are 
evil (quoad formale). “God concurs in producing the ‘effect/ 
but not the ‘defect.’” The proof for the first (quoad materiale) 
is given in Acts 17, 25—28; for men live, move, and have their 
being in God, and receive life, breath, and all things from Him, 
not only when they do good, but also when they do evil. The 
second (quoad formate) is proved from Deut. 32, 4; Ps. 92,15, etc.; 
for there it is stated that the “Lord is upright” and that “there 
is no unrighteousness in Him.” God’s work is perfect; for He 
is “a God of truth and without iniquity; just and right is He.” 

Of course, this does not explain the whole mystery in divine 
concurrence, but it shows us within what confines we must restrict 
our thoughts on this matter. Speculations that go beyond this 
either result in self-deception, or they deny the truths of Scripture 
(Acts 17,28: God’s providence; Deut. 32, 4: His righteousness). 
The doctrine that man alone is responsible for his evil deeds though 
God concurs in them must be strenuously maintained on grounds 
of both Scripture and conscience. The pantheistic error that God 
must be held accountable for human transgression is repudiated 
not only by Scripture, but also by man’s own conscience (Rom. 
2,15 : “their thoughts accusing”). 

Holy Scripture describes God’s concurrence in evil actions also 
as permission (permissive providence). We therefore speak Scrip- 
turally when we say: “God permits evil, or suffers it to occur,” 
Ps. 81,12; Acts 14,16; Rom. 1, 28, etc. As Hollaz rightly points 
out, such permission is a) not kind indulgence, as though it did 
not offend God when men commit sin; b) nor a mitigation of 
the Law, as though God granted men license to sin under certain 
circumstances; c) nor a weakness in God or a defect of knowledge 
or power on His part, as though He were ignorant of it or could 
not check it; d) nor indifference to sin, as though God were an 
unconcerned witness of it; but e) a negative act, inasmuch as God 
does not place insuperable difficulties in the way of the sinner, but 
allows him to rush into iniquity, Matt. 26, 23. “God indeed per¬ 
mits, but does not will that which He permits.” (Quenstedt.) 
Frequently also God, in His most righteous judgment (iustitia 
vindicativa), punishes sin with sin, Rom. 1, 24—28. But even in 
these cases He neither wills the original evil act, nor has He plea- 



THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 


193 


sure in the superadded sin. God is never the cause or abetter of 
sin, Ps. 5, 4—6; Eom. 1,18 f. 

With respect to God’s concurrence in good acts we must dis¬ 
tinguish between acts that are done a) in His Kingdom of Power 
(regnum potential) and b) in His Kingdom of Grace (regnutn 
gratiae). The first are civilly good works (iustitia dvilis) and the 
second spiritually good works (iustitia spirituals). The iustitia 
civilis God works in the unregenerate by His almighty government 
of all things (regnum potential) and rewards it with earthly and 
temporal blessings, Ex. 1, 20. 21. The iustitia spirituals God 
works in the regenerate by the gracious operation of the Holy 
Ghost, who bestows not only the ability to do good (potentia 
agendi), but also works the good act itself (ipsum agendi actum), 
as Scripture clearly testifies, Phil. 2,13; 2 Cor. 3, 5; Phil. 1, 29. 

5. DIVINE PROVIDENCE AND FREE WILL 
(LIBERTAS A COACTIONE). 

Although men live, move, and have their being in God, they 
remain free, or self-determining, beings, who are personally re¬ 
sponsible to God for whatever they do ( libertas a coactione, free¬ 
dom from coercion). This truth is taught in Scripture, Acts 
17, 30, and is supported by experience. (Eom. 1, 32 : “Who, know¬ 
ing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are 
worthy of death.”) 

In this connection we may consider also the question: “Must 
things happen just as they do happen (necessitas immutdbilitatS), 
or could they happen otherwise (contingentia rerum) ? On the 
basis of Scripture we maintain both the necessitas immutabilitatS 
and the contingentia rerum; the first, from the viewpoint of divine 
providence; the second, from the viewpoint of human respon¬ 
sibility. Thus the betrayal, condemnation, and death of Christ 
had to occur since God by His gracious plan of salvation had de¬ 
creed all this to happen from eternity, Acts 4, 27. 28; - Matt. 26, 54. 
Yet neither Judas nor Pilate was coerced by God to perpetrate the 
crimes by which the Savior was delivered into death, Luke 22, 
21—23; Matt. 26, 24; John 19,12. For this reason our dogma- 
ticians have said: Ratione providentiae Dei, quae omnia regit, 
necessario omnia fieri rede dicuntur; respedu hominS libere et 
contingenter res fiunt et aguntur omnia in rebus humanS. If the 
necessitas is denied, the alternative is atheism or epicureanism 

13 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



194 


THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 


(“Things happen without God”); if the contingentia is denied, 
the alternative is fatalism or Stoicism (“Man is coerced to sin”). 

In view of the fact that “with respect to man all things happen 
freely and contingently” (respectu hominis lib ere et conting enter 
res fiunt), man is bound, both in the realm of nature and of grace, 
to the means which God has appointed for his welfare. In bodily 
sickness he must apply medicine; for the sickness of his soul he 
must apply the means of grace (the Word and the Sacraments), 
through which God works and preserves faith, Rom. 10,17. It is 
both foolish and sinful to try to ascertain divine providence a priori, 
by setting aside the divinely prescribed means; for in that case we 
arrogantly endeavor to explore God in His sovereign majesty 
(Luther: in nuda maiestate) and thus tempt Him, Matt. 4, 6. 7. 

Similar to the truth just discussed is the question concerning 
the end of human life (terminus vitae). Also here we must main¬ 
tain both the necessity and the contingency. For Scripture teaches, 
on the one hand, that the days of a man are so determined that he 
cannot pass the appointed bounds, Job 14, 5; this is said with 
respect to divine providence (ratione providentiae Dei). On the 
other hand, Scripture teaches that God often changes the natural 
limit of human life with respect both to the godly and the wicked. 
He prolongs the life of the godly either as a reward for their obe¬ 
dience, Ex. 20,12; Prov. 3,1. 2; 4,10, or for the common good of 
His Church, 2 Cor. 1,10.11; Phil. 1, 23. 24; or He shortens their 
life to preserve them from distress and evil. Is. 57,1. 2. Whenever 
God shortens the life of the wicked, this is to be regarded as a just 
punishment for their wickedness, Gen. 38, 7.10. All this, however, 
is said respectu hominis, or from the viewpoint of contingency. 

From the viewpoint of contingency (respectu hominis) we 
must therefore say that the limit of human life is not absolutely 
and immutably decreed, Is. 38, 5. For the sake of clearness our 
dogmatician8 have also said that men die either by the dispensing 
or by the permissive providence of God; that is to say, if men 
use the prescribed means (Acts 27, 33ff.: food; 1 Tim. 5, 23: 
medicine; Eph. 6,2. 3: piety; 2 Kings 20,1—6: prayer; Acts 
9, 25: avoidance of danger, etc.), they will by the grace of God 
attain to that limit of life which His dispensing providence has 
fixed; but if they reject the prescribed means, transgress His divine 
laws, and live wickedly, their life will be shortened by His per¬ 
missive providence, 2 Sam. 18, 14; 17, 23; Gen. 9, 6; Ex. 
21,12, etc. All Scripture-passages that describe the terminus vitae 



THE DOCTRINE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 


195 


in terms of contingency must be regarded as a gracious conde¬ 
scension on the part of God to our feeble understanding in order 
that we may use for our admonition or consolation the divine 
truths which He has graciously revealed for our temporal and 
eternal good. But even in cases where life is shortened or length¬ 
ened, God must not be regarded as mutable in His essence or 
decrees, since what appears to us as either shortening or length¬ 
ening of life has been decreed by Him from eternity. In other 
words, man dies exactly when God has willed that he should die, 
Luke 12, 20; 2, 26; Phil. 1, 23. 24; Judg. 6, 23; Ps. 90, 3—10. 
Beyond this our thoughts dare not go since Scripture itself sets 
this limit.

THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS. 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS. 

(De Angelis.) 


1. THE EXISTENCE OF ANGELS. 

The doctrine of the holy angels must be drawn not from 
reason, according to which their existence is at best only probable, 
but alone from Scripture, which from Genesis to Revelation teaches 
their existence, Gen. 3, 24; 32,1. 2; Ps. 104,4; Rev. 12, 7. In 
other words, also of this doctrine Scripture is the only principvum 
cognoscendi. Modern rationalistic theology rejects the doctrine of 
the angels (“There is no personal devil. Even the existence of 
good angels cannot be proved”), just because it has discarded Scrip¬ 
ture as the only source of faith. 

However, while Holy Scripture clearly teaches the existence 
of angels, it does not state definitely the time of their creation, 
though this was within the hexaemeron. Certainly the angels were 
not created before the world, since prior to the creation no crea¬ 
ture existed, John 1,1—3; Col. 1,16. Nor were they created after 
the sixth day of creation, since God on that day ceased to create, 
Gen. 2,2. 3. Scripture informs us definitely that on the sixth day 
“the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them,” 
Gen. 2,1, which certainly includes the angels. 

2. THE NAME “ANGEL.” 

The term angel tiyyekos), by which Holy Scripture 

designates this class of creatures, does not describe their essence, 
but their office (nomen officii) and signifies “one sent,” or a mes¬ 
senger. The nature of the angels is described by the term spirit 
(nvevfia ). That the name angel is a designation of office is clear 
from the fact that Scripture ascribes it a) to ministers of the 
divine Word, Mai. 2, 7; Matt. 11,10, and b) to the Son of God, 
the “uncreated Angel,” as the supreme and unique Messenger of 
God, Mai. 3,1; John 3,17. 34; Is. 63, 9; Gen. 48,16, etc. The 
important question, “When does the Scriptural expression Angel 
of the Lord (njrp denote the Angelus increatus, or Christ ?” 

our dogmaticians answer as follows: “Whenever the name Jehovah 
or divine works and worship are ascribed to the Angel in Scripture, 
then this Angel must be understood to be the Son of God.” 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS.

3. THE NATURE OF THE ANGELS. 

The angels are spirits (: nvevfiaxa), that is, spiritual beings, who 
are without any bodily form whatsoever. To ascribe to them even 
an ethereal corporeity, as has been done in ancient and modern 
times, is opposed to Luke 24, 39 and Eph. 6,12, where corporealness 
is absolutely denied to spirits. The bodies in which angels from 
time to time appeared to men, Gen. 18, 2; 19,1, were only assumed 
(unio accidentalis) . The consumption of food by angels, Gen. 18, 8; 
19, 3, must be regarded neither as a natural eating nor as a mere 
form, but as an act which is as incomprehensible to us as is their 
temporary assumption of an accidental body. “Homines edunt et 
bibunt ob egestatem, angeli autem instar flammae consumunt cibum 
ob potentiam/ 1 says J. A. Osiander. The temporary consumption of 
food like the temporary assumption of a body served to convince the 
persons to whom they appeared of their true presence. While the 
angels are jivev/jiaxa, Heb. 1,14, and God is Jivevfia, John 4, 24, yet 
the difference between the angels and God is as vast as is that 
between the finite creature and the infinite Creator. In contra¬ 
distinction to the human soul, which is an incomplete spirit 
(spiritus incompletus), because it has been created as an essential 
part of man in union with the body, the angels are complete 
spirits (spiritus completi), because they exist properly as spirits. 
In contradistinction to God, the infinite Creator, the angels are 
finite creatures. Like men in this respect they are real persons 
(vnooxaoeig), endowed with intelligence and will, Eph. 3,10; Heb. 
1,14. Intelligence and will may be predicated also of the fallen 
angels, Gen. 3; Matt. 4, though their mind is perverse and their 
will depraved. According to Scripture the angels, though being 
immaterial beings, can nevertheless react upon the bodies of men, 
Gen. 19,16; Matt. 4, 5, much in the same manner as the human 
soul reacts upon the body. Since the angels are intelligent beings, 
they are capable of becoming acquainted both with one another and 
with men, Luke 1,13.19. Yet they know only as creatures, not as 
God, so that omniscience and prescience must be denied to them. 
Whatever knowledge they have they possess a) by virtue of their 
peculiar nature (2 Sam. 14, 20: natural knowledge); b) by divine 
revelation (1 Pet. 1, 12; Luke 2, 9—12: revealed knowledge); 
c) by the beatific vision which they enjoy (Matt. 18,10: beatific 
knowledge). 

Since the angels are spiritual beings, we ascribe to them the 



198 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS. 


following attributes: a) indivisibility, which is due to their in¬ 
corporeity, or immateriality; b) invisibility, which is a conse¬ 
quence of their spirituality; c) immutability, inasmuch as they 
are not subject to physical changes: they do not beget, nor are 
they begotten, Matt. 22, 30; they are neither increased nor dimin¬ 
ished ; they neither grow old, nor do they decay; and yet they are 
not absolutely immutable, as God is, but only relatively, or in 
relation to men; d) immortality, inasmuch as they do not die, 
though God could annihilate them if He so willed; e) endless 
duration, inasmuch as they have a beginning, but not an end, Matt. 
18,10; Jude 6; f) illocality, because as incorporeal beings they 
occupy no space, but are present at a certain place definitely (in ubi 
definitive)), though not omnipresently like God, who is everywhere 
present repletively; g) agility or velocity, inasmuch as they are 
able to change the “where” of their presence with extreme celerity, 
though without local motion, such as must be predicated of mate¬ 
rial bodies. 

As intelligent beings the angels moreover possess freedom of 
will and, in view of the service for which they are designed, great 
power. The will of angels is free with respect both to a) imma¬ 
nent acts, such as choosing or rejecting, Jude 6, and b) external 
acts, such as moving about, speaking, praising God, etc., Luke 2, 
9—15. Though the evil angels, being declared enemies of God, 
cannot but oppose Him, yet they do so of their own free will, 
John 8, 44. The power of the angels is very great, Ps. 103, 20; 
2 Thess. 1, 7; 2 Kings 19, 35; yet it is a finite power, completely 
under the control of God, Job 1,12. While their power is super¬ 
human, Ps. 91,11. 12, or greater than that of man, Luke 11, 21. 22, 
they are not omnipotent, but subject to God, who rules over them, 
Dan. 7,10. While, strictly speaking, only God performs miracles 
(Ps. 72, 18), nevertheless Holy Scripture teaches that the good 
angels (2 Kings 19,35) and the prophets (2 Kings 6,5.6) and 
apostles (Acts 3, 6—12) performed miracles in His name and 
by His divine power (Ex. 15, 23—25). Whenever the devil 
performs deeds that to men seem to be miracles (mirdbilia sen 
mira), these are in reality “lying wonders” and “strong delusions,” 
with which God permits him to deceive such as “believe not the 
truth, but have pleasure in unrighteousness,” 2 Thess. 2, 9—12. 

The claim that angels once mingled with men by marriage, 
Gen. 6, 2, is as foolish as it is anti-Scriptural, Matt. 22, 30. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS. 


199 


4. THE NUMBER AND RANKS OF ANGELS. 

According to Holy Scripture the number of angels is very 
large (Dan. 7,10: “thousand thousands and ten thousand times 
ten thousand”; Luke 2,13: “a multitude of the heavenly host”; 
Ps. 68, 17: “twenty thousand, even thousands of angels”). All 
these expressions are symbolical numbers, standing for uncounted 
thousands. How great is the goodness of God, who created so 
many holy ministers for the benefit of man! 

That there are ranks, or orders, among the angels is clear from 
the special names given them in Scripture (Gen. 3, 24: cherubim; 
Is. 6, 2: seraphim; Col. 1,16 : thrones, dominions, principalities, 
powers; 1 Thess. 4,16: archangel). Also among the evil angels 
there are greater and lesser spirits (Matt. 25, 41: “the devil and 
his angels”; Luke 11, 15. 18. 19: “Beelzebub, the chief of the 
devils”). However, we can neither determine the number of the 
angels, nor can we describe the ranks, or orders, among them since 
Holy Scripture does not give us adequate information on this 
subject, nor does it always enumerate the angelic ranks in the 
same order (cp. Col. 1,16 with Eph. 1, 21), so that we cannot tell 
which is the higher and which the lower. Gregory Nazianzen: 
"Ordo angelorum notus est ei, qui ipsos ordinavit.” Baier aptly 
remarks that, while the angels differ from one another with respect 
to rank, they do not differ from one another with respect to kind 
and nature (specie et essentia). In the appointment of ranks, or 
orders, among the angels we witness the wisdom of God, who is not 
“the author of confusion,” 1 Cor. 14, 33. 

5. GOOD AND EVIL ANGELS. 

As to their first estate (status originalis) all angels were 
originally created equally righteous, good, and holy; for they were 
to glorify God and render Him holy service (status gratiae). That 
means that in the beginning all angels were positively good, not 
morally indifferent, nor tainted by a proclivity to evil. This is 
clear from the divine verdict “very good,” Gen. 1, 31. That there 
are now two classes of angels, the good and the evil, is due to the 
fact that some angels did not remain in the original state, but of 
their own accord fell away from God into sin. From the state of 
grace (status gratiae) they thus passed into the state of misery 
(status miseriae). 

The good angels are those who persevered in the goodness, 
righteousness, and holiness in which they were first created. They 



200 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS. 


have been confirmed by God in that which is good (in bono con- 
firmati) as a gracious reward for their obedience, so that they can 
no longer lose their goodness and become evil (non posse peccare). 
Thus the good angels reached the goal for which they were orig¬ 
inally created; for they forever behold God in holy service, having 
passed from the state of grace into the state of glory (status 
gloriae). This truth is taught in Matt. 18,10; 6,10; 1 Tim. 
5,21; Luke 20,36; Gal. 1,8. 

Since Scripture identifies the good angels with the “elect 
angels” (1 Tim. 5, 21), they persevered in their concreated right¬ 
eousness and holiness in accord with God’s eternal election. How¬ 
ever, Scripture nowhere teaches that the evil angels fell into sin 
because from eternity they were predetermined to damnation; on 
the contrary, the evil angels left their own habitation, Jude 6, or 
sinned, of their own accord. 

By evil angels we, then, mean those angels who did not per¬ 
severe in their concreated wisdom and righteousness, but of their 
own free will turned away from God, became perpetual enemies 
of God and man, and have been divinely doomed to be plagued with 
eternal torments (in malo confirmati). The eternal punishment of 
the evil angels is taught in Matt. 25, 41; Rev. 20, 10; 2 Pet. 
2, 4; Jude 6. By what special motive the disobedience of the evil 
angels was prompted Scripture does not teach with certainty; but 
it is probable (ratio probdbilis) that it was their impious pride 
which moved them to apostatize from God. The time when the 
evil angels first sinned cannot be determined with certainty; but 
their rebellion occurred before the fall of man, since man’s fall into 
sin was instigated by the devil, Gen. 3,1—14; John 8, 44. That 
the evil angels can never be restored to holiness and happiness is 
a fact known also to them, Matt. 8,29 and should not be gainsaid 
by men (Universalism), since Scripture emphatically describes the 
fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels as an 
everlasting fire, Matt. 25, 41. While the good angels were con¬ 
firmed in bliss when they entered into the state of glory. Matt. 
18, 10; 25, 31, the evil angels, when entering into the state of 
misery, became hardened in evil, so that they incessantly think 
perversely of God and divine things. Hollaz: “The evil angels 
know God, but they dreadfully shudder at the divine knowledge,” 
Jas. 2,19. 

To the question “Why may not the wicked angels be restored 
to favor ?” Gerhard replies: “It is better to proclaim the wonderful 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS. 


201 


philanthropy and mercy of the Son of God towards the fallen race- 
of man . . . than to scrutinize beyond due limits the causes of 
that most just judgment by which God delivered the angels who 
had fallen away from Him to be cast in chains of darkness into 
hell, reserved for judgment.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 215.) 

6. THE HOLY SERVICE OF THE GOOD ANGELS. 

The good angels are so confirmed in holiness that they always 
behold God and perpetually enjoy His goodness. Matt. 18,10. With 
this beatific vision there is joined indissolubly the purest love of 
God; for in the state of glory they neither can sin (impeccability) 
nor desire to sin (2 Cor. 11,14: “an angel of light”). The objec¬ 
tion that the good angels in the state of glory are no longer 
morally free since they are impeccable is based upon a false con¬ 
ception of moral freedom. The angels are free moral agencies, and 
yet their will is directed only to that which is holy (Rev. 14,10: 
“in the presence of the holy angels”). In this respect the saints in 
heaven will be equal to the holy angels, Luke 20, 36. With regard 
to the election of the angels (1 Tim. 5, 21), we must hold on the- 
basis of Scripture: a) that the angels were not elected in view of 
Christ’s redemption since they never became sinners, Heb. 2,16; 
b) that the evil angels were not rejected by an absolute eternal 
decree (papists, Calvinists), but were reserved unto eternal judg¬ 
ment because of their apostasy, 2 Pet. 2, 4. 

In accord with their beatific vision and perfect love of God 
the good angels render perpetual service to God, Is. 6, 3; Luke 
2, 13, and to His saints on earth, Ps. 104, 4; 103, 20. 21; Heb. 
1,14. So far as God is concerned. He is not in need of the ser¬ 
vice of the holy angels since He does not require it for His own 
bliss (non ex quadarn Dei indigentia ); however, He has willed 
it (ex voluntate Dei libera). In particular, the holy angels serve- 
children, Matt. 18,10; but also all believers in their work and 
calling, Ps. 91,11.12, and at their death, Luke 16, 22. The ques¬ 
tion whether each believer and especially each Christian child has 
a special guardian angel. Scripture does not answer with sufficient 
clearness, Matt. 18,10; Acts 12,15. 

While the holy angels, according to Scripture, also serve the 
political estate, Dan. 10,13; Is. 37, 36, and the domestic estate, 
Ps. 34, 7; Matt. 18,10, the object of their special ministry is the 
Christian Church; for they a) reverence and promote the message 
of salvation, Luke 2,13; 1 Pet. 1,12; Eph. 3,10; b) rejoice at 



202 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS. 


the repentance of sinners, Luke 15,10; c) minister God’s Word to 
men, Deut. 33, 2; Gal. 3, 19; Luke 2,10—12; d) protect the 
saints of God, Jude 9; e) are present at public worship, 1 Cor. 
11,10; 1 Tim. 5,21 f.; f) will announce the final Judgment, Matt. 
25, 31; 1 Thess. 4,16; g) and assist in its execution, Matt. 24, 31; 
13,41; 25,31; 13,42.50; Mark 13,27. 

On account of this holy service we should highly esteem God’s 
blessed angels (modern rationalistic theology regards the doctrine 
of the angels as superfluous), rejoice in their ministry, and think 
of them with pious awe, 1 Tim. 5, 21, though we should not honor 
them by divine worship (cidtus religiosus), since they are only 
creatures, to whom no worship is due, Rev. 22, 8. 9. Baier 
writes thus: “On account of these perfections which we discover 
the angels to possess and because they favor and assist us very 
greatly, it is also becoming that we praise and love them and take 
heed lest we offend them by evil deeds. But it is not becoming to 
us to direct our prayers to the angels. For that is impious and 
idolatrous.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 213.) 

7. THE EVIL WORK AND ETERNAL PUNISHMENT 
OF THE EVIL ANGELS. 

The wicked angels are evil not because they were so created, 
but because they willingly fell away from God (non ortu, sed 
lapsu). We are not in a position to say why God did not provide 
a Redeemer for the fallen angels as He did for fallen man; but 
Quenstedt suggests as a probable reason (probabilis ratio) that the 
devils sinned without any temptation (Jude 6), while Eve was 
deceived by Satan (Gen. 3, 1—7) and Adam was tempted by 
his wife. But in no case must this explanation be used to limi t 
the free compassion of the gracious God upon men. The fall of 
the evil angels affected their intelligence (vis intelligendi, intel- 
lectus). Scripture describes them, on the one hand, as exceedingly 
cunning, Gen. 3, Iff.; 2 Cor. 11, 3; Eph. 6,11, on the other hand, 
however, as indescribably stupid, because they defeat their own 
purposes. Thus Christ’s death, which Satan promoted, Luke 
22, 53, was his own undoing, John 12, 31. 

The evil angels constantly exhibit and exert their enmity 
toward God, Rev. 12, 7, and attempt the temporal and eternal ruin 
of man, Gen. 3, Iff.; 1 Pet. 5, 8. In their endeavor to injure man 
they harm him a) in his body, Luke 13,11.16; b) in his earthly 
possessions. Job 1, 12 ff.; Matt. 8, 31. 32; c) in his soul, John 



THE DOCTKINE OF THE AXGELS. 


203 


13,27; Acts 5,3; Eph. 2, 2. 3. Unbelief (status incredulitatis), 
with its dreadful punishment of eternal damnation, Mark 16,16, is 
the result of Satan’s pernicious work in men, Eph. 2,1. 2; 2 Cor. 
4, 4; Matt. 13, 25. All who refuse to believe the Gospel do as 
Satan prompts them; for he holds them in his power, Acts 26,18; 
Col. 1,13. The very denial of the personal existence of a devil is 
the result of the devil’s operation in the human heart, 2 Cor. 11,14. 

On the basis of Holy Scripture we distinguish between spir¬ 
itual obsession (obsessio spiritualis) and physical obsession (ob- 
sessio corporalis). The first applies in a wider sense to all unbe¬ 
lievers, who are held captive by Satan in spiritual darkness, Col. 
1,13, and in a narrower sense to those wicked persons whose minds 
are possessed, filled, and actuated by Satan in an intensified way 
(Judas, the Pharisees). Passages dealing with spiritual obsession 
in this sense are: Luke 22,3; John 13,2; Acts 5,3; 2 Thess. 2, 
9—11; 2 Cor. 4,4. Spiritual obsession does not remove human 
responsibility, Matt. 25, 41, since the person so obsessed sins of his 
own free will, John 8,43—45. Bodily obsession occurs when the 
devil immediately and locally inhabits and governs the body, con¬ 
trolling it according to his will, Mark 5,1—19; Luke 8, 26—39. 
Bodily obsession is an affliction which may befall even true, be¬ 
lieving Christians, as the passages just quoted show. In all cases 
of bodily obsession a person has no intellectual, emotional, and 
volitional functions of his own, but as long as the obsession en¬ 
dures, Satan, who is personally (xar ' ova'iav) present in him, acts in 
.and through him, so that in all cases of bodily obsession human 
responsibility ceases. (Cp. cases in which persons who are bodily 
obsessed deplore in moments of recovery the blasphemies which 
they uttered.) 

The fury of the evil angels is directed especially against the 
Church of Christ; for they a) constantly seek to destroy it by 
their onslaughts in general, Matt. 16,18; b) try to prevent hearers 
from accepting the Word of God, Luke 8,12; c) spread false 
■doctrine, Matt. 13, 25; 1 Tim. 4, Iff.; and d) incite persecutions 
against the kingdom of Christ, Kev. 12, 7. In particular, Satan 
has wrought unspeakable harm in the Church by inflicting upon 
it the tyranny and doctrinal perversions of Antichrist, 2 Thess. 2. 
For the purpose of ruining the Church, the devil also troubles the 
political estate (1 Chron. 21, 1; 1 Kings 22, 21. 22) and the 
domestic estate (1 Tim. 4, 1—3; 1 Cor. 7, 5; Job 1, 11—19). 
Scripture teaches also that God employs the evil angels to punish 



204 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS. 


the wicked for their rejection of truth (2 Thess. 2,11.12) and to 
try the faithful (Job 1,7ff.; 2 Cor. 12, 7). 

The punishment of the evil angels is eternal torment in hell, 
Matt. 25,41. The question whether the fire of hell is material 
(real fire) or immaterial (torment) we may leave undecided; for, 
on the one hand. Scripture speaks of the fire of hell in terms of 
real fire, Mark 9, 43; Rev. 14, 10. 11; 21, 8; on the other, it 
teaches that all material things in their present form shall cease 
with Judgment Day, 2 Pet. 3,10—12. In either case the torment 
will be unspeakably great, Luke 16,24; Matt. 25,46; 2 Thess. 
1, 9; Jude 6. 7. All who deny that the damnation of the devil 
and his angels is everlasting must also deny the eternal salvation 
of the believers, Matt. 25,46, since the term ( aldiviog ) is used to 
describe the endless duration of both heaven and hell. 

In conclusion, let us remember that all things that Holy 
Scripture reveals concerning the fall, the works, and the punish¬ 
ment of the evil angels are written for our warning in order that 
we may escape the just judgment of God by believing in Him who 
destroyed the works of the devil, 1 John 3, 8. 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


205 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 

(De Anthropologia.) 

The doctrine of man falls into two divisions: a) the state 
of integrity (status integritatis) and b) the state of corruption 
(status corruptionis). 

A. Man Before the Fall. 

(De Statu Homlnis ante Lapsum.) 

1. MAN CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. 

The state of integrity is the original condition of man. Man 
was created after the image of God, in wisdom, holiness, and right¬ 
eousness. The state of integrity is proved in Scripture a) by God’s 
general verdict “very good,” Gen. 1, 31, and b) by the special state¬ 
ment that God made man in His image, Gen. 1, 26. 27. For all 
practical purposes the designations image, and likeness, men, 
may be treated as synonyms. Luther: “ein Bild, das uns gleich 
set”; Baier: "imago simillima .” 

In his original state man bore a resemblance to God because 
He Himself was the pattern, or archetype, after which man was 
made. According to Scripture, Adam was created after the like¬ 
ness of the Triune God, Gen. 1, 26, and not after that of Christ 
alone (the error of Osiander). 

2. DEFINITION OF “IMAGE OF GOD.” 

The divine image consisted not simply in man’s original en¬ 
dowment with intelligence and will, so that he, in contradistinction 
to all animals, was a rational being, but above all in the right 
disposition of his intellect and will, so that by means of his un¬ 
depraved intellect he knew God and divine things and by means 
of his uncorrupt will desired only that which God wills. Also his 
appetition (appetitus sensitivus) was in complete accord with the 
divine norm of holiness, so that in the state of integrity man Was 
entirely upright and uncorrupt in all his endowments, powers, and 
attributes. Calov writes (IV, 389) : “It is called a state of in¬ 
tegrity because man in it was upright and uncorrupt (Eccl. 7, 29) 
in intellect, will, the corporeal affections, and endowments and in 
all things was perfect. It is also called the state of innocence 
because man was innocent and holy, free from sin and pollution.” 
( Doctr . Theol., p. 220.) Man’s state of integrity is proved also by 



206 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


the fact that Adam and Eve were in perfect agreement with God’s 
commandments, Gen. 2,19ff.; 3, 2. 3. In the New Testament the 
image of God is described in Col. 3,10 (“knowledge”) and Eph. 
4,24 (“righteousness and true holiness”). 

The evolutionistic view, according to which man was originally 
a brute, without the faculty of speech and without moral endow¬ 
ments, is therefore anti-Scriptural. According to Scripture, man 
was not created as a beast, but as the lord of all the other creatures 
of God, Gen. 1, 26—31; 2,16—23. In addition to perfect moral 
endowments man was blessed also with great intellectual endow¬ 
ments, so that he possessed an undimmed and blissful knowledge 
of God, as also an intuitive knowledge of God’s creatures (science), 
such as no scientist after the Fall has ever attained, Gen. 2,19—20. 
23. 24. Luther very aptly comments that Adam was an insignis 
philosophic. 

As we reject the evolutionistic delusion, so also the papistical 
error that man was originally in a state of moral indifference (in 
statu purorum naturalium), in which he was neither positively 
good nor positively evil, but morally “neutral,” or indifferent. In 
opposition to this erroneous opinion, Scripture teaches that orig¬ 
inally man’s will was in perfect conformity with the holy will of 
God (sanctae Dei voluntati conformis et amore et fiducia Dei 
praeditus). Not merely was he inclined toward all that is good 
and God-pleasing, but he himself was positively good and holy. 
The spiritual and moral excellences of man in his state of integrity 
are summed up in the expression original, concreate righteousness 
(iustitia originalis concreata), which describes his absolute con¬ 
formity with divine holiness and the absolute purity of his desires 
and appetites. 

3. THE RELATION OF THE DIVINE IMAGE TO THE 
NATURE OF MAN. 

The original wisdom, righteousness, and holiness of man in his 
first estate were not a “supernatural” gift of God, superadded to 
him to render his original estate complete and perfect (papists: 
donum, supematurale, donum superadditum) , but a concreate gift 
(donum concreatum, iustitia originalis, iustitia concreata), since he 
received the image of God at the very moment of his creation, 
Gen. 1, 26. 31. For this reason man’s nature after the Fall is no 
longer in an uncorrupt state (natura integra, in puris naturalibus) 
as the papists teach, but in a state of corruption (natura corrupta. 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


207 


natura sauciata). Though the image of God does not constitute 
the nature of man, since even after the Fall he is still a true man, 
yet the divine image belonged to the nature of the uncorrupt man 
or to the uncorrupt human nature. It is certainly a proof of total 
corruption that man, though he was created for the glory of God 
and still knows of His existence and rule (Rom. 1, 19), should 
neither love nor adore the Creator, but worship the creature. 
Therefore we declare on the basis of Scripture that man through 
the Fall has entirely lost the image of God in its proper sense, 
that is, his concreate wisdom, righteousness, and holiness, so that 
his intellect now is veiled in spiritual darkness, 1 Cor. 2,14, and 
his will is opposed to God, Rom. 8, 7. 

In view of this fact the question arises. How are we to under¬ 
stand such passages as Gen. 9, 6 and Jas. 3, 9 ? Luther and other 
dogmaticians (Philippi, Hofmann) explain them as describing 
man as he was originally and as he should again become through 
faith in Christ Jesus (restoration of the divine image through 
regeneration). Melanchthon, Baier, Quenstedt, and others regard 
them as teaching a divine image in a wider sense, namely, inas¬ 
much as man, even after the Fall, is still an intelligent, self- 
determining rational being, who even now, though feebly, rules 
over the creatures of God. But also those theologians who speak 
of an image of God in the wider sense admit that the divine image 
in its proper sense was lost through the Fall, Col. 3,10; Bph. 
4, 24. For the sake of clearness and accuracy it is preferable to 
adopt Luther’s explanation of the passages quoted. The unregen¬ 
erate are so far from possessing the divine image that they are said 
to have no hope and to be without God in the world, Eph. 2,12, 
as also, that what they sacrifice they sacrifice to the devils and 
not to God, 1 Cor. 10,20. 

The seat of the divine image was not the body, but the soul 
of man; for the knowledge of God together with holiness and 
righteousness inheres properly in the soul. Nevertheless also the 
body shared in the divine image, since it is the organ of the soul. 
For this reason bodily immortality (immortalitas corporis) was an 
immediate result of man’s possession of the divine image. Death 
entered into the world through the Fall, Gen. 2,17; Rom. 5,12; 
6, 23. The claim that death is caused by the matter of which the 
body consists must be regarded as a pagan view. Since man orig¬ 
inally was without sin, he was free also from painful and destruc¬ 
tive sufferings, Gen. 3,16ff. The original condition of man was 



208 


THE DOCTRINE OF HAN. 


therefore one of supreme happiness; for a) his soul was wise and 
holy; b) his body was free from suffering and death; c) his con¬ 
dition of life was most blessed; and d) his condition of habitation 
was most pleasant, since God placed him into a garden of pleasure, 
called Paradise, to dwell there and enjoy His goodness forever, 
Gen. 2, 8—15 DT)B; nagadeioog). 

The intimate communion and blissful association of uncor¬ 
rupt man with the holy God, Scripture itself cites as a proof of 
the status integritatis, Gen. 2,19 ff.; so also the fact that our first 
parents were naked, yet not ashamed, Gen. 2, 25. Cf. Luther, 
St. L., I, 170.) 

4. IMMEDIATE RESULTS OF THE DIVINE IMAGE. 

According to Scripture the immediate results of the divine 
image in man were a) immortality, b) dominion. 

That Adam and Eve were created immortal is clear from Gen. 
2,17; Rom. 5,12; 6,23. Had they not sinned, they never would 
have died. Death was threatened them if they would become dis¬ 
obedient to their Creator. Whether they would have dwelled end¬ 
lessly in Paradise, or whether God would have received them into 
heaven in His own time Scripture does not say. With respect to 
immortality we rightly distinguish between absolute and relative, 
or conditional, immortality. The former denotes absolute freedom 
from death and its destructive power, in which sense God, the 
angels, the human souls, and the bodies of the saints in heaven 
and of the damned in hell are immortal. The latter denotes 
freedom from the natural tendency to die, yet so that death could 
happen under a certain eventuality, in which sense man in the 
state of integrity was immortal. It is one thing not to be able to 
die, another to be able not to die, and still another not to be able 
not to die. The first is said of the saints in heaven; the second, 
of Adam and Eve in their state of integrity; the third of all 
sinners after the Fall (Quenstedt). 

Man’s dominion over the creatures, according to Scripture, 
was an immediate result of his possession of the divine image 
(iustitia originalis concreata). The dominion of man must be 
regarded as real sovereignty, so that all the other creatures will¬ 
ingly rendered him service. After the Fall man possesses only 
a faint vestige of this absolute dominion (species dominii, nudus 
titulus dominii), since now he must apply force and cunning to 
control the creatures over which he endeavors to rule. The rebel- 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


209 


lion of the creatures against man is the direct consequence of his 
own rebellion against God, or of the loss of his concreated wisdom, 
holiness, and righteousness, and should continually remind him 
of the heinousness of sin and of the dreadfulness of its effects, 
Ps. 39, 4^6. 

5. THE DIVINE IMAGE AND WOMAN. 

Not only Adam, but also Eve possessed the divine image. This 
is clear a) from Gen. 1, 27; b) from Col. 3,10; Eph. 4,24, com¬ 
pared with Gal. 3, 28; for with regard to the renewal after the 
image of God there is no difference between male and female; 
and c) from Gen. 1, 28, where dominion is ascribed to the woman as 
well as to the man. Nevertheless the woman in her relation to 
the man occupied a position of subjection even before the Fall; 
for not only was she taken from man, but she was also created as 
his helpmeet, Gen. 2,18—22; 1 Cor. 11, 7—9; 1 Tim. 2,11—13. 

This divine order must not be subverted; for it is the will of 
God that the woman should not usurp authority over the man by 
ruling over him. But, on the other hand, the woman should not 
be tyrannized or made a slave; for though she was not taken from 
the head of Adam to govern him, yet neither was she taken from 
his feet to be trodden under by him. Luther says: “Woman should 
be regarded with reverence; for she is God’s handiwork. She was 
created that she might be a helpmeet for her husband, bring up 
children, and rear them in faith and piety.” Both the man and 
the woman serve best in that relation or sphere in which God has 
created each, Eph. 5, 21—33; Titus 2, 3—5; 1 Cor. 7, 20, whereas 
the abrogation of the divine order will result in confusion and 
injury for human society, Prov. 1, 24—33. (Cp. Luther, St. L., 
V, 1517; II, 540; II, 687; XVI, 2280.) 

6. THE ULTIMATE END OF THE IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN. 

In His infinite grace, God bestowod His divine image upon 
man in order a) that he might know and serve Him and experience 
perfect enjoyment in communion with Him, and b) that he might 
be His representative ruler upon earth, Gen. 1, 27. 28. As after 
the Fall the redemption of man was motivated by divine love, John 
3,16, so also the creation of man in God’s image before the Fall, 
Ps. 104, 23. 24; 136,1—9. Although man in the state of integrity 
intimately knew God, he did not know the eternal decree of re¬ 
demption; for this was especially revealed to him after the Fall, 
Gen. 3,15. Hence our first parents knew God as gracious in Him- 

14 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



210 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


self, but not as gracious on account of Christ’s vicarious atonement. 
After the Fall and the promulgation of the protevangelium the 
divine object of man’s knowledge and adoration has therefore be¬ 
come different; for now he trusts and adores God as gracious only 
through the priceless redemption of the Savior, Luke 1, 77. The 
Biblical concept of salvation (ocoTrjgla, stilus) cannot be applied to 
man’s state of integrity, since it presupposes both sin and the re¬ 
demption from sin, Luke 19,10. 

B. The State of Corruption. 

(De Statu Peccatl.) 

Through the Fall (peccatum originans) man has lost his con- 
create righteousness and holiness (iustitia originalis concreata), so 
that he is now in a state of corruption (in statu corruptionis). 
This state is defined by Quenstedt as follows (II, 48) : “The state 
of corruption is that condition into which man voluntarily precipi¬ 
tated himself by his own departure from the chief Good, thus 
becoming both wicked and miserable.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 231.) 
The fall of man was therefore neither his exaltation (Gnosticism), 
nor the most fortunate event in human history (Schiller), nor 
a critical stage in his evolutionistic development (modern evolu¬ 
tionism), nor a necessary step in his moral and intellectual progress 
(pantheism). The fall of man was apostasy from God, Gen. 3, 
14—19, and therefore evil both in its nature and in its effects, 
Gen. 3, 22—24; Rom. 5,12. Hence it is as a sinner (homo pec- 
cator) that fallen man is the subject of sacred theology (subiectum 
operationis theologiae), whose purpose it is to restore in him the 
image of God through faith in Christ Jesus, 2 Cor. 3, 5. 6.18. For 
this reason the doctrine of sin constitutes an essential part in 
Christian theology, Rom. 1, 18—32; 2, 1—12. — Commonly the 
doctrine of sin is treated under three heads: a) Sin in General 
(De peccato in genere); b) Original Sin (De peccato originaU); 
c) Actual Sins (De peccatis actualibus). 

A. OF SIN IN GENERAL. 

(De Peccato in Oenere.) 

1. DEFINITION OF SIN. 

According to Scripture, man should be in complete conformity 
with the divine will (conformitas cum voluntate Dei), as this is 
revealed in the divine Law (vopog). Every departure from the 
norm of the divine Law is sin (ivopta), no matter whether it con- 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


211 


sists in a state or condition (status, habitus) or in actual deeds 
(actiones iniernae et extemae). Considered etymologically, sin is, 
in the first place, a negative concept ( dvopta ), and as such it de¬ 
notes man’s lack of conformity with the divine Law (carentia con- 
formitatis cum lege). So Scripture defines sin (1 John 3,4: “Sin 
is lawlessness,” dvopia). But sin is also a positive concept, and 
as such it denotes opposition to, or transgression of, the Law, so that 
positively sin is a violation of the Law. So, too. Scripture defines 
sin (1 John 3,4: “He does lawlessness, dvoptav noiel; Matt. 
7, 23: “Ye that work lawlessness,” IgyaCopevoi ttjv dvopiav). 
The reason for this is obvious. Man, destitute of righteousness, is 
at the same time in constant, active rebellion against the divine 
Law. In other words, after the Fall man wilfully refuses to recog¬ 
nize the obligation he has toward God (Rom. 1,18. 32) and con¬ 
stantly breaks the divine Law, since his carnal mind is enmity 
against God, Rom. 8, 7. On the basis of Holy Scripture we there¬ 
fore describe sin, a) negatively, as a lack of righteousness or of con¬ 
formity with the divine will (carentia conformitatis cum lege); 
b) positively, as actual opposition to the divine will (carnalis con- 
cupiscentia sive inclinatio ad malum). 

When defining sin, we must beware of the error of the papists 
and rationalists, who condemn as sinful only those evil acts which 
are done consciously and deliberately. Against this pernicious 
error the Apology testifies: “But in the schools they [the papists] 
transferred hither from philosophy notions entirely different, that 
because of passions we are neither good nor evil, we are neither 
deserving of praise nor blame. Likewise, that nothing is sin unless 
it be voluntary (inner desires and thoughts are not sins if I do not 
altogether consent thereto). These notions were expressed among 
philosophers with respect to civil righteousness and not with respect 
to God’s judgment.” (Art. II (I), § 43.) According to Scrip¬ 
ture both the evil deeds, 2 Sam. 12,13, and the evil thoughts and 
desires, Jas. 1,15; Rom. 7,17; Matt. 5, 28, are sins, even if they 
are done unknowingly and without deliberation, Rom. 7, 19; 
1 Tim. 1, 13. Indeed, according to Scripture even the inherited 
corruption, which yet cleaves to the Christian and which he ear¬ 
nestly deplores, is sin in an absolute sense, Eph. 2, 3; John 3, 5. 6; 
Rom. 7,19. 24. 

2. THE DIVINE LAW AND SIN. 

Since sin is “lawlessness” ( dvopxa ), it is necessary to know 
what law Scripture means when it describes sin as a “transgression 
of the Law.” If the doctrine of the divine Law is perverted by 



212 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


man’s adding to or subtracting from it, then also the doctrine of 
sin must needs be perverted. It is therefore necessary that we 
define that Law the transgression of which makes a thought or 
deed sinful. The Formula of Concord describes the Law in the 
sense in which it is here used as a “divine doctrine in which the 
righteous, immutable will of God is revealed, what is to be the 
quality of man in his nature, thoughts, words, and works in order 
that he may be pleasing and acceptable to God.” (Thor. Decl., 
Art. V, 17.) This definition is Scriptural; for only God can decree 
laws for men, since this is His divine prerogative, Jas. 4,12. Laws 
enacted by men are binding only if God Himself has given men 
authority to make them and so has given the human laws divine 
sanction. This is the case with all laws of civil government and 
with all parental commandments, Eom. 13,1; Col. 3, 20, provided 
they do not contradict the divine Law, Acts 5, 29. But this is not 
the case with the so-called “laws of the Church,” since God has 
expressly withheld from the Church legislative authority, Matt. 
23,10. Hence in the Church only those laws are to be acknowl¬ 
edged as binding which have been enacted by God Himself. 

In all matters where no special divine laws obtain, decisions 
should be reached by Christians through mutual agreement on 
the basis of Christian love, 1 Cor. 16, 14. Of the Pope, Luther 
rightly says that he has filled the whole world with a Satanic obe¬ 
dience, since he has taught men to obey, not the Law of God, but 
his own pernicious laws (St. L., I, 765). While it is true that only 
God’s immutable will constitutes the divine Law which binds all 
men, it is equally true that the whole divine Law, with all its 
demands and prohibitions, must be taught by the Church. For 
as little as the Church has authority to make laws of its own, just 
so little has it authority to discard any laws which God has made, 
Matt. 5,17—19 ; Mark 7, 6—13. 

Since the Old Testament ceremonial laws have been abolished 
through the coming of Christ, Gal. 4,9—11; 5,1—4, they are no 
longer in force in the New Testament, Col. 2,16, so that the im¬ 
mutable will of God which now obligates all men must be identified 
with the Moral Law, Matt. 22, 37—40; 1 Tim. 1, 5. For this 
reason we define sin in general as a deviation from the divine 
Moral Law, no matter whether that Law has been written in the 
human heart or communicated to man by positive precept. For the 
Jews in the Old Testament also every deviation from the cere¬ 
monial or political laws constituted a sin; but since in the New 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


213 


Testament these laws have been abolished by God’s express will, 
Col. 2,16, it would be a sin to reinstitute them as necessary and 
binding upon the consciences of New Testament believers, Matt, 
15, 9; Gal. 5, 1—4. The laws which God enacted as temporary 
man must not declare to be permanent. 

3. HOW THE DIVINE LAW CAN BE KNOWN. 

Through the Fall the absolute knowledge of the divine will 
which God at creation had planted into the human soul was greatly 
weakened or obscured. For this reason man after the Fall no 
longer knows the divine will, or Law, with certainty, though his 
conscience ( awd&rjatg, conscientia) in a measure still functions, 
Rom. 2,14.15. Moreover, after the Fall, conscience may err (con¬ 
scientia erronea), so that man often regards as forbidden what 
God allows (eating of certain foods at certain times, drinking of 
spirituous liquors, etc.), or, vice versa, regards as allowed what He 
has forbidden (worshiping idols, trusting in one’s works for sal¬ 
vation). So also conscience may entertain doubts (conscientia 
dubia) with regard to the propriety of certain acts, or it may 
suggest no more than a mere probability (conscientia probabilis) 
of right or wrong, so that man remains uncertain with regard to 
the course which he must follow. Conscience, after the Fall, is 
therefore no longer a safe standard of what God wills or forbids. 
The only inerrant norm by which God’s immutable will may be 
known with certainty is Holy Scripture, which contains a com¬ 
plete revelation of the divine Law, Matt. 5,18.19; Gal. 3, 23. 24, 
though properly this was given to men for the sake of the Gospel, 
Rom. 3,19—22. 

From Holy Scripture we know with certainty which laws were 
meant to be temporary and which, on the other hand, all men at 
all times must obey, Col. 2,16.17; Gal. 5,1. 2. The immutable 
will of God is the Moral Law, which binds all men and obligates 
them to obedience, Matt. 22, 37—40; Rom. 13, 8—10. While the 
Moral Law is summarily comprehended in the Decalog, the Ten 
Commandments, in the form in which they were given to the Jews, 
Ex. 20,1—17, must not be identified with the Moral Law, since they 
contain ceremonial features. Ex. 20, 8—11; Deut. 5,12—15. Only 
in its New Testament version may the Decalog be identified with 
the Moral Law, or the immutable will of God, Rom. 13, 8—10; 
Jas. 2,8; 1 Tim. 1, 5. (Cp. Luther, St. L., XX, 146 ff.) 

It is self-evident that commandments given to individual be- 



214 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


lie vers (man data specialia), Gen. 22, must not be interpreted as 
applying to men in general. That the Mosaic laws regarding the 
prohibited degrees of consanguinity and affinity. Lev. 18, pertained 
not only to the Jews, but to men in general is indicated by the 
text itself, Lev. 18,24—30, though the levirate command was tem¬ 
porary, obligating only the children of Israel (Deut. 25, 5—10; 
cp. v. 10: "His name shall be called in Israel,” etc.) 

4. THE CAUSES OF SIN. 

While fallen man in his state of depravity is always inclined 
to shift the responsibility for his sin on God or on other creatures, 
Gen. 3,12.13, Holy Scripture teaches expressly that God is in no 
way whatever the cause of man’s sin. Hence God must be charged 
with sin neither directly ("God created man with the evil tendency 
to sin”) nor indirectly ("God is a cause of sin in so far as He 
concurs in evil actions,” quoad materiale). 

Questions such as "Why did God create man subject to temp¬ 
tation ?” or “Why does He still allow men to be tempted by sin ?” 
belong to the "unsearchable judgments and ways” of God, which 
are past finding out, Rom. 11, 33—36. We neither can answer 
them, nor should we try to answer them, Job 40,1—5; 42,1—6. 
Perverted reason will either charge God with being the cause of 
sin (pantheistic determinism) or deny the reality of sin (atheism). 
According to Scripture, however, God was the cause of sin neither 
in the devil, John 8, 44, nor in man, Gen. 1, 31; nor does He ap¬ 
prove or abet sin in any person, Gen. 2,17; 3, 8; 4, 6. 7; Ps. 5,4. 5. 
Not even in evil actions, in which He concurs quoad materiale, does 
God will the sinfulness of such actions (John 19,11 compared with 
Luke 22, 52. 53). Also the fact that God permits sin (Acts 14,16) 
or punishes sin with sin (Rom. 1, 26; 2 Thess. 2,11) must not be 
construed as if He were in any way the cause of evil; for in all 
these cases He manifests His punitive justice (iustitia vindicativa ). 
According to Scripture the external, or remote, yet principal, 
cause of sin is Satan, who sinned first and then seduced man into 
sin, John 8,44; 2 Cor. 11, 3; Rev. 12, 9, while the internal and 
directly efficient cause of sin is man’s corrupt will, which permits 
itself to be enticed into sin by Satan (Gen. 3, 6. 17; John 8, 44: 
"The lusts of your father ye will do”). The Augsburg Confession 
says (Art. 19) : "Although God does create and preserve nature, 
yet the cause of sin is the will of the wicked, that is, of the devil 
and ungodly men.” Hence man is responsible for his sin, or 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


215 


a sinner (subiectum quod peccati), in spite of the fact that he 
is misled into sin and held captive in it by the devil, Eph. 2, 2. 
The subiectum quo, or the proper seat of sin, is the soul (intellect 
and will) of man, though the body shares in his sin, since it is the 
organ of the soul. To regard the soul as pure and the body as 
polluted is a pagan error (Gnosticism). Since Holy Scripture 
condemns all men as sinners, Rom. 3, 4—23, the papistical doctrine 
of the immaculate conception of Mary must be rejected as anti- 
christian, 2 Thess. 2, 9.10. 

5. THE CONSEQUENCES OF SIN. 

Because sin is lawlessness (avopia), which God has expressly 
forbidden, man through sin becomes guilty before God, Rom. 3,19 
(reatus culpae) and subject to His most just punishments, Gal. 
3,10 (reatus poenae). How sin should be punished (the manner 
and extent of punishment) is not for guilty man to decide, but 
has been determined and decreed by God Himself, Deut. 9, 5 ; Rom. 
6,23; Matt. 25,41. 

The transgression of our first parents was immediately fol¬ 
lowed by death (Gen. 2,17; Rom. 5,12) in its threefold aspects 
as a) spiritual death, inasmuch as they lost the divine image and 
became alienated from God and entirely corrupt in their whole 
nature, Gen. 5, 3; John 3, 5. 6; b) temporal death, inasmuch as 
they were now subject to bodily dissolution with all its incidental 
diseases and miseries, Gen. 3,16—19; and c) eternal death, inas¬ 
much as they were now under the curse of eternal damnation, 
2 Thess. 1,9; Matt. 25, 41. However, the sentence of death was 
stayed by the promise of the divine Redeemer of the sinful human 
race, Gen. 3,15. Since all descendants of Adam share in his guilt 
and corruption, Rom. 5,12; Ps. 51, 5, all without exception are 
under the curse and condemnation of the Law, Rom. 3,19—23. 
But as they share in Adam’s sin, so they share also in the redemp¬ 
tion of the Savior who was promised to our first parents, Rom. 
5,15—21. 

The guilt and punishment of sin must be constantly empha¬ 
sized by the Christian theologian, since man in his depravity re¬ 
fuses to believe what the divine Law teaches with regard to sin and 
its consequences. He denies the temporal punishments of sin 
(disease, death), explaining them as natural events; and he denies 
the eternal punishment of sin. Matt. 25, 41; 2 Thess. 1, 9, though 
his conscience accuses and condemns him, Rom. 1, 32; 2, 15. 



216 


THE DOCTRINE OF HAN. 


Even believers, in so far as they are flesh, refuse to believe the 
severity of God’s threats, Ps. 90,11.12, and therefore Christ Him¬ 
self so earnestly proclaimed the truth that the divine punishment 
of sin is eternal, Mark 9, 43—48. 

While the effusions of divine wrath upon the wicked must be 
regarded as a real punishment for sin (poena vindicativa), the suf¬ 
ferings of believers in this life (1 Cor. 11, 32) are in reality fatherly 
chastisements (castigationes paternae), which flow not from wrath, 
but from love (Ps. 94,12; Heb. 12, 6; Eev. 3,19), though in form 
and appearance they do not differ from the punishments of the 
wicked. Luther rightly calls the chastisement of God’s saints 
a “gracious and joyous punishment.” 

B. ORIGINAL SIN. 

(De Peccato Originali.) 

1. DEFINITION OF ORIGINAL SIN. 

Original sin (peccatum origimle), or the state of depravity, 
which followed Adam’s transgression and which now inheres in all 
his posterity, embraces a) hereditary guilt (culpa hereditaria) and 
b) hereditary corruption (corruptio hereditaria). That the guilt 
of Adam is imputed to all his descendants is taught in Rom. 5,18: 
“By the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condem¬ 
nation”; v. 19: “By one man’s disobedience many were made 
sinners.” The hereditary corruption of all descendants of Adam 
is clearly taught in Ps. 51, 5: “I was shapen in iniquity, and in 
sin did my mother conceive me”; John 3, 6 : “That which is born 
of the flesh is flesh.” That the word flesh (oag£) here denotes cor¬ 
ruption (corrupt flesh) is proved by v. 5: “Except a man be born 
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of 
God.” Therefore the term is here used precisely as in Rom. 8, 7 : 
“the carnal mind” (to (pgovrjua zrjg oagy.og). According to Scrip¬ 
ture, God, then, imputes (3E*n, Xoyit^Ezai) the guilt of Adam to all 
his descendants (Rom. 5,12: “for that, igr>’ (p, all have sinned”). 

Hence, while the expression “original sin” is not a Scripture- 
term (vox uygagpog), but one coined by the Church, the matter 
which it denotes is truly Scriptural. Original sin is so called 
a) because it is derived from Adam, the root and beginning of the 
human race; b) because it is connected with the origin of the 
descendants of Adam; and c) because it is the origin and fountain 
of all actual transgressions (Hollaz.) In Scripture it is described 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


217 


a) as indwelling sin, Eom. 7,17; b) as a law in the members, Eom. 
7,23; and c) as lust (hu&vuia), Jas. 1,14.15. All these expres¬ 
sions depict original sin with respect to its nature or its effects. 

Hollaz defines original sin thus: “Original sin is the thorough 
corruption of human nature, which by the fall of our first parents 
is deprived of original righteousness and is prone to every evil.” 
The Formula of Concord declares: “Original sin is not a slight, 
but so deep a corruption of human nature that nothing healthy 
or uncorrupt has remained in man’s body or soul, in his inner or 
outward powers.” (Epit., Art. I, 8.) A more extended definition 
is given by Quenstedt (II, 52) : “Original sin is a want of original 
righteousness, derived from the sin of Adam and transmitted to 
all men who are begotten in the ordinary mode of generation, 
including the dreadful corruption and depravity of human nature 
and all its powers, excluding all from the grace of God and eternal 
life and subjecting them to temporal and eternal punishments, 
unless they be born again of water and the Spirit or obtain the 
remission of their sins through Christ.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 242.) 

In opposition to the Scriptural doctrine of original sin, all 
Pelagians and modern rationalistic theologians deny that a foreign 
sin (peccatum alienum) can rightly be imputed to Adam’s de¬ 
scendants. They claim that men can be charged only with 
the evil deeds which they themselves have committed. However, 
Scripture teaches the imputation of Adam’s guilt to his descen¬ 
dants in such a way that, if the imputation of guilt is denied, also 
the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to Adam’s descendants 
must be denied. Eom. 5,18.19: “As by the offense of one, judg¬ 
ment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the right¬ 
eousness of One the free gift came upon all men unto justification. 
As by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the 
obedience of One shall many be made righteous.” The imputation 
of original guilt belongs to the stubborn facts which Scripture 
teaches as undeniable truth. The objection that the guilt of Adam 
cannot be charged to his descendants because “the son shall not 
bear the iniquity of the father,” Ezek. 18,19. 20, ignores the fact 
that “God as Judge, in agreement with His supreme judicial 
authority, punishes man’s crime of violating His majesty also in 
his descendants” (Quenstedt). — God does impute Adam’s guilt to 
his descendants, and He is just in doing so. But that same God 
in love imputes to sinners also Christ’s righteousness so that they 
may be saved. 



218 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


Original corruption (corruptio hereditaria) is transmitted to 
all men through the ordinary mode of generation, Ps. 51, 5; 
John 3,6. Since Christ was conceived by the Holy Ghost in the 
womb of the Virgin Mary, Luke 1, 35, His nature was not cor¬ 
rupted by sin (immaculate conception). However, for Mary, TTia 
mother, no immaculate conception can be claimed, since she was 
born according to the ordinary mode of generation, Luke 1,27, and 
was therefore in need of a Savior herself, Luke 1,47. In reply to 
the objection that godly parents cannot transmit sin to their chil¬ 
dren since their sins have been forgiven, Gerhard says: “Carnal 
generation is not according to grace, but according to nature”; 
and Augustine: “In begetting, he [the parent] does not give that 
whence one is regenerated, but whence one is generated.” ( Doctr. 
Theol., p. 243.) 

While original corruption may be known to some extent from 
reason (Horace: " Nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur” ; Cicero: “Z» 
omni continuo pravitate et in summa opiniorum perversitate ver- 
samur, ut paene cum lacte nutricis errorem suxisse videamur”), 
the Smaicald Articles rightly declare: “This hereditary sin is so 
deep and horrible a corruption of nature that no reason can under¬ 
stand it, but it must be learned and believed from the revelation of 
Scripture.” (Part III, Art. I, 3.) And the Formula of Concord: 
“But if it is further asked what kind of an accidens original sin is, 
that is another question, of which no philosopher, no papist, no 
sophist, yea, no human reason, however acute it may be, can give 
the right explanation, but all understanding and every explanation 
of it must be derived solely from the Holy Scriptures, which testify 
that original sin is an unspeakable evil and such an entire cor¬ 
ruption of human nature that in it and all its internal and ex¬ 
ternal powers nothing pure or good remains, but everything is 
entirely corrupt, so that on account of original sin man is in God’s 
sight truly spiritually dead, or with all his powers dead to that 
which is good.” (Thor. Decl., I, 60.) 

With respect to original corruption all those err a) who deny 
it altogether, asserting that children are corrupted not by propaga¬ 
tion (generations), but by the bad example of others (exemplo); 
b) who admit the corruption of human nature, but deny that it 
is sin, since only voluntary transgression is sin (peccatum volun- 
tarium); and c) who minimize original corruption (Semi- 
Pelagians, synergists). However, wherever the doctrine of orig- 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


219 


inal corruption is minimized, there also the doctrine of salvation 
■by grace alone (sola gratia) is perverted; for the sola gratia always 
presupposes the total corruption of human nature (intima cor- 
ruptio naturae humanae). 

2. THE CORRUPT MIND AND WILL OF MAN. 

Holy Scripture is very explicit in describing the effects of 
original corruption on the intellect and will of man. With respect 
to the intellect, original sin implies a total want of spiritual light, 
so that man by nature cannot know or understand the truths of 
God’s Word which pertain to his conversion and salvation. Indeed, 
he is so blinded that he regards the Gospel as foolishness, 1 Cor. 
2, 14, while he looks upon the very Law which condemns him, 
Gal. 3, 10—12, as the true way to salvation, Gal. 3, 1—3; Eph. 
4,17.18. This dense spiritual darkness is not removed by educa¬ 
tion or culture, 1 Cor. 2, 6—9; Col. 2, 8, but solely by the Holy 
Ghost through the Gospel, Acts 16, 14; 2 Cor. 4, 6. While the 
intellect of corrupt man is unable to know the Gospel and is thus 
at fault negatively, it positively is prone to pass rash and false 
judgments concerning spiritual things, Acts 2,13; 17,18. 32, and 
to harden itself against the divine truth, Acts 7, 51. 

The Formula of Concord describes this deplorable state of 
natural man as follows: “By the fall of our first parents man was 
so corrupted that in divine things pertaining to our conversion and 
the salvation of our souls he is by nature blind, so that, when the 
Word of God is preached, he neither does nor can understand it, 
but regards it as foolishness; also, that he does not of himself 
draw nigh to God, but is and remains an enemy of God until he 
is converted, becomes a believer (is endowed with faith), is regen¬ 
erated and renewed, by the power of the Holy Ghost through the 
Word when preached and heard, out of pure grace, without any 
cooperation of his own.” (Thor. Dec!., II, 5.) 

Again: “Although man’s reason or natural intellect indeed 
has still a dim spark of the knowledge that there is a God, as also 
of the doctrine of the Law, Rom. 1, 19 ff., yet it is so ignorant, 
blind, and perverted that, when even the most ingenious and learned 
men upon earth read or hear the Gospel of the Son of God and 
the promise of eternal salvation, they cannot from their own powers 
perceive, apprehend, understand, or believe and regard it as true, 
but the more diligence and earnestness they employ, wishing to 
comprehend these spiritual things with their reason, the less they 



220 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


understand or believe, and before they become enlightened and are 
taught by the Holy Ghost, they regard all this only as foolishness 
or fictions, 1 Cor. 2,14; 1, 21; Eph. 4,17 ff.; Matt. 13,11 ff.; Luke 
8,18; Rom. 3,11.12. Accordingly the Scriptures flatly call nat¬ 
ural man in spiritual and divine things darkness, Eph. 5, 8; Acts 
26,18; John 1, 5. Likewise the Scriptures teach that man in sins 
is not only weak and sick, but defunct and entirely dead, Eph. 
2,1. 5; Col. 2,13.” (Thor. Decl., II, 9.10.) 

With respect to the will of fallen man Holy Scripture teaches 
a) that it actually and constantly opposes the divine Law, Eph. 
2, 3; 1 Pet. 4, 3. 4, and b) that on account of its total corruption 
it cannot but oppose God’s will. Rom. 8, 7: “It is not subject to 
the Law of God, neither indeed can be.” The will of natural man 
is therefore both in constant opposition to God and in constant 
agreement with Satan and his evil will, Rom. 8, 7; Eph. 2, 1; 
John 8, 44; Rom. 6,17. 20; Heb. 2,16. Even the externally good 
deeds of natural man (imtitia civilis) do not flow from true love 
of God, Eph. 2,12, but at best from natural sympathy or com¬ 
passion and similar causes, though generally such “good works” 
have their source in vainglory and work-righteousness, Matt. 23, 
25—28. 

The Augsburg Confession rightly declares (Art. II): “Since 
the fall of Adam all men begotten in the natural way are born 
with sin, that is, without the fear of God, without trust in God, 
and with concupiscence.” And the Formula of Concord says: “In 
spiritual and divine things the intellect, heart, and will of the 
unregenerate man are utterly unable by their own natural powers 
to understand, believe, accept, think, will, begin, effect, do, work, 
or concur in working, anything; but they are entirely dead to 
what is good, and corrupt, so that in man’s nature since the Fall, 
before regeneration, there is not the least spark of spiritual power 
remaining nor present by which of himself he can prepare him¬ 
self for God’s grace, or accept the offered grace, nor be capable of 
it for and of himself, or apply or accommodate himself thereto, 
or by his own powers be able of himself, as of himself, to aid, do, 
work, or concur in working, anything towards his conversion either 
wholly or half or in any, even the least or most inconsiderable, part, 
but that he is the servant (and slave) of sin, John 8, 34, and a cap¬ 
tive of the devil, by whom he is moved, Eph. 2, 2; 2 Tim. 2, 26. 
Hence the natural free will according to its perverted disposition 
and nature is strong and active only with respect to what is dis¬ 
pleasing and contrary to God" (Thor. Decl., II, 7.) 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


221 


As the will of natural man is opposed to God, so also his 
appetition (appetitus sensitivus), which, prompted by inordinate 
desires, impels him to rush into all manner of vices that seem 
agreeable to his perverted senses, although these are prohibited 
by the divine Law, Eom. 1, 32; 1, 26—27; 13,13. Original sin 
is therefore “the root and fountainhead of all actual sins,” as the 
Formula of Concord rightly states (Thor. Decl., I, 5). 

It is this constant opposition to the divine will and habitual 
inclination to evil (hdbitualis inclinatio ad malum) that makes 
original sin a positive evil, or sin in the full sense of the term, 
indeed, the “chief sin” (principium et caput omnium peccatorum). 
The Augsburg Confession declares (Art. II) : “This disease, or vice 
of origin, is truly sin, even now condemning, and bringing eternal 
death upon, those not born again through Baptism and the Holy 
Ghost. They condemn the Pelagians and others [Semi-Pelagi- 
anism, Scholasticism] who deny that original depravity is sin and 
who, to obscure the glory of Christ’s merit and benefits, argue that 
man can be justified before God by his own strength and reason.” 

3. THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDES 
OF ORIGINAL SIN. 

As already pointed out, Holy Scripture describes original sin 
both a) as a defect, or lack of concreated righteousness (carentia 
iustitiae concreatae), and b) as concupiscence, that is, as a con¬ 
stant, vicious disposition to evil (habitualis inclinatio ad malum). 
This is taught in Eom. 7, 23: “I see another law in my members, 
warring against the law of my mind”; Gal. 5, 17: “The flesh 
lusteth against the Spirit”; etc. It is as concupiscence that orig¬ 
inal sin is something positive (positivum quid). However, sin is 
not positive in the sense that it is a material substance, which 
subsists of itself (substantia materialis, quae proprie subsistit). 
Original sin is not a substantia, that is, a self-existent essence, but 
an accidens, that is, an accidental matter, which does not exist by 
itself essentially, but inheres in a self-existent essence. Hence we 
must distinguish between human nature, which also after the Fall 
is the work of God, and the corruption of human nature, or orig¬ 
inal sin, which is the work of the devil. 

This truth the Formula of Concord strenuously maintains 
against every form of Manicheism (Flacianism), which assumes 
two existent substances, of which one is essentially good and the 



222 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


other essentially evil. (Formula of Concord, Art. I. Augustine r 
“Original sin is not the nature itself, but an accidens vitium in 
natura, that is, an accidental defect and damage in nature.” Thor. 
Decl., I, 55.) 

On the other hand, our confession contends against Pelagi- 
anism and synergism with equal emphasis that original sin as an 
accidens is not “a slight, insignificant spot sprinkled or a stain 
dashed upon the nature of man or a corruption only in some acci¬ 
dental things, along with and beneath which the nature never¬ 
theless possesses and retains its integrity and power even in spir¬ 
itual things” (Thor. Decl., I, 21), but “such an unspeakable evil 
and such an entire corruption of human nature that in it and all 
its internal and external powers nothing pure or good remains, 
but everything is entirely corrupt, so that on account of original 
sin man is in God’s sight truly dead” (Thor. Decl., I, 60). Thus 
our Lutheran confession avoids both the Scylla of Manicheism and 
the Charybdis of Pelagianism. 

4. THE UNIVERSALITY OF ORIGINAL SIN. 

Holy Scripture teaches very emphatically that all descendants 
of Adam are corrupted by original sin, so that not a single human 
being after the Fall is uncorrupt or without the taint and pollution 
of sin, Rom. 5,12; 3, 23; John 3, 5. 6. For this reason our dog- 
maticians say that the subiectum quod of original sin are all men 
born in the course of nature (naturaliter nati). Christ was not 
subject to original sin because He was conceived through the 
miraculous operation of the Holy Ghost, Matt. 1,20; Luke 1,35. 
The anti-Scriptural decree of Pope Pius IX (1854), which in the 
interest of Mariolatry ascribed to the mother of Christ an immacu¬ 
late conception, proves the antichristian character of the Papacy. 

The doctrine of the universality of original sin is of the 
greatest importance for the right understanding of the doctrine of 
the means of grace. In particular, it is the foundation of the 
doctrine of Baptism; for since all children are “flesh born of the 
flesh,” John 3, 6, and Baptism is the divinely ordained washing 
of regeneration, Titus 3, 6, regarding which Christ commanded 
that “all nations” should be baptized, Matt. 28,19, it is obvious 
that children, whom God desires to be saved through the means of 
grace, Matt. 19,14.15, should receive Holy Baptism. The opinion 
that children born of Christian parents are unspotted by sin is 
opposed to the clear teaching of Scripture, Ps. 51, 5; John 3, 6. 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


22a 


5. THE CAUSE OF ORIGINAL SIN. 

The cause of original sin (peccatum originate) is not God, who 
in His just wrath condemns and punishes this sin, Eph. 2, 3, but 
a) the devil (causa remota), who seduced our first parents, Gen. 
3, Iff.; John 8,44; 2 Cor. 11, 3; and b) our first parents them¬ 
selves (causa propinqua), who allowed themselves to be misled, 
Rom. 5,12; 1 Tim. 2,14. Hollaz writes: “Our first parents are 
the proximate cause of the original blemish, from whose impure 
nature the original stain has flowed into our hearts. Everything 
follows the seeds of its own nature. No black crow ever produces 
a white dove, nor does a ferocious lion beget a gentle lamb; and 
no man polluted with inborn sin ever begets a holy child.” ( Doctr . 
Theol., p. 239.) 

6. THE EFFECTS OF ORIGINAL SIN. 

The effects of original sin in man are a) death with all its 
temporal and eternal punishments and b) the manifold actual sins, 
of which each human being, being bom in sin, is guilty. 

Original sin entails, first of all, spiritual death, or the 
alienation of sinful man from the holy God, Eph. 2, 1. 5. 12. 
Unless spiritual death is removed through conversion, temporal 
death, Ps. 90, 7—9, which is a direct punishment of the first 
transgression, Gen. 2,17, is followed by eternal death, or endless 
damnation, Matt. 25,41; 2 These. 1, 9. The divine injunction “In 
the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,” Gen. 2,17, 
was literally fulfilled, since spiritual death followed immediately 
upon the transgression, and our first parents were at once subject 
to temporal and eternal death. 

The answer to the question how the eating of the fruit of the 
forbidden tree could produce results so dreadful is given by Scrip¬ 
ture itself. The disastrous consequences of the first transgression 
were due not to any poisonous substance in the fruit itself nor to 
the fact that the devil had taken possession of the tree, but de¬ 
volved upon Adam and Eve because in eating of the forbidden 
fruit, they transgressed the divine commandment, Gen. 2, 17. 
If it is further asked why God did not make another commandment 
the test of man’s obedience, the Lutheran theologian Brenz replies: 
“Since the Moral Law was already written in man’s heart, it pleased 
God to try his [man’s] faith by a commandment not already made 
known to him.” However, it must not be forgotten that all these 



224 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


questions in the last analysis belong to the unsearchable judgments 
of God, which lie beyond the grasp of human reason. 

Original sin is the source of all actual transgressions, so that 
all actual sin comes from within man, Mark 7,21—23; Ps. 51, 
3—5; for since the fountain has been polluted, the waters flowing 
from it are likewise unclean. Because God is not the author of 
sin, but hates and condemns it, Ps. 11, 5; 5,4. 5, His wrath and 
just punishments rest upon guilty man, Bom. 3,19, both on ac¬ 
count of his original sin and his actual sins, Eph. 2, 3; Bom. 5,18. 

C. ACTUAL SINS. 

(De Peccatls Actualibus.) 

1. DEFINITION OF ACTUAL SIN. 

By actual sin (peccatum actuate) we understand all lawlessness 
( dvo/uia) which is done, or committed. It thus stands in contra¬ 
distinction to that dvo/uia which all men inherit from their parents 
through their sinful birth (quae in omnes homines per camalem 
generationem derivatur) and on account of which they are con¬ 
demned as sinners (imputatio peccati Adamitici ; corruptio heredi¬ 
taria), even when they have not yet broken the divine Law through 
transgression of individual commandments, Bom. 5,19. Or, more 
briefly described: “Actual transgression is every act, whether ex¬ 
ternal or internal, which conflicts with the Law of God.” (Hutter.) 
Luther very fittingly calls original sin “person sin,” “nature sin,” 
or “essential sin,” because it is “not a sin which is committed,” 
but one which “inheres in the nature, substance, and essence of 
man, so that, though no wicked thought erver should arise in the 
heart of corrupt man, no idle word were spoken, no wicked deed were 
done, yet the nature is nevertheless corrupted through original sin.” 
(Formula of Concord, Epit., I, 21.) Actual sins are divided into 
sins of commission and omission, that is, sins which occur by doing 
(agendo) what the divine Law prohibits or by omitting (omit- 
tendo) what the divine Law commands. For this reason Hollaz 
defines actual sin thus: “Actual sin is a turning away, by a human 
act either of co mm ission or omission, from the rule of the divine 
Law, incurring responsibility for guilt (reatus culpae) and liability 
to punishment (reatus poenae).” (Doctr. Theol., p. 252.) 

The omission of the good which the Law demands is an actual 
sin, because it is prompted by hatred against God, love of evil, and 
wilful neglect of duty in opposition to conscience, Bom. 1, 32; 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


225 


Luke 12, 47. 48. To actual sins belong also all evil thoughts and 
desires with regard to both doctrine and life, Matt. 5, 28; Gen. 
20, 9; Matt. 15,19; Rom. 7, 7. In Holy Scripture actual sins are 
called "works of the flesh,” Gal. 5,19; "unfruitful works of dark¬ 
ness,” Eph. 5,11; "deeds of the old man,” Col. 3, 9; "dead works,” 
Heb. 6,1; 9,14; "unlawful deeds,” 2 Pet. 2, 8, all of which ex¬ 
pressions characterize these sins with respect to their nature 
and source. — Our Lutheran Catechism aptly defines actual sin as 
"every transgression of the divine Law in desires, thoughts, words, 
and deeds.” We recommend this definition as one that is clear, 
simple, and eminently practical. 

2. THE CAUSES OF ACTUAL SIN. 

Actual sins are prompted by causes within man (causae 
peccati actualis intra hominem) and causes outside man (causae 
peccati actualis extra hominem). 

The real cause of actual sinB within man is his corrupt nature 
(corruptio hereditaria), as Scripture declares. Rom. 7, 17 : “It is 
no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.” In particular, 
Scripture mentions as causes of actual sins: a) the spiritual igno¬ 
rance which results from hereditary corruption, 1 Tim. 1,13; Matt. 
26, 65. 66, cp. with Acts 3,17; b) sinful emotions and passions, 
such as fear (Matt. 14, 30; Mark 14, 66ff.; Gal. 2, 12), wrath 
(Luke 9, 54. 55; 4, 28. 29), and the like; however, neither man’s 
ignorance nor his sinful passions excuse the evil deeds which are 
committed because of them, nor do they remove the sinfulness of 
such acts, 1 Tim. 1,15; Luke 22, 62; c) the habitual evil inclina¬ 
tion (habitus vitiosus) which is produced and confirmed by re¬ 
peated sinful acts, Jer. 13, 23; for though the inclination to evil 
is innate in man, there is also an acquired evil inclination, or 
a vicious disposition, which has its source in his sinful practises 
(inclinatio ad malum acquisita; peccatum habituale acquisitum; 
habitus vitiosus acquisitus). It is self-evident that man is respon¬ 
sible also for the sins that have their source in his vicious habits 
and practises, Rom. 1, 24—27, and which in moments of sober re¬ 
flection he may earnestly deplore ( e . g., a confirmed drunkard). 

As causes of actual sins outside man, Scripture mentions 
a) the devil, who not only actuates the unregenerate, Eph. 2, 2; 
1 Cor. 10, 20, but also seeks to seduce the regenerate into sin, 
1 Chron. 21,1; Luke 22, 31; Matt. 16, 23. How Satan tempts be¬ 
lievers to commit actual sins is well illustrated by his temptation 

CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 15 



226 


THE DOCTEINE OF MAN. 


of Christ, though he could not prevail against Him, Matt. 4, Iff. 
b) Men who mislead persons to sin by their false teachings, Rom. 
16,17.18; 2 Tim. 2,17, by ungodly or immoral words and writ¬ 
ings, 1 Cor. 15, 33, and by wicked deeds, 2 Pet. 2,1—3, are also 
causes of actual sins. 

Though God is in no way the cause of actual sin, or of evil 
deeds, yet He is the author of evil in the sense of tribulation or 
affliction, Is. 45, 7. This truth Holy Scripture sets forth for the 
comfort of all believers who endure trials and chastisements in 
this life, Acts 14, 22, to the glory of God, 2 Cor. 12, 9, and their 
own good, Rom. 8, 28. 

3. THE DOCTRINE OF OFFENSE. 

The sin of tempting any one to evil, Scripture describes as 
giving offense, Rom. 16,17. For one to give offense means to teach 
or do anything by which another is occasioned either not to believe 
or to believe error or to lead a wicked life, so that his faith is either 
endangered or even destroyed. For this reason Scripture warns us 
most solemnly against the crime of giving offense, Matt. 18, 6ff.; 
Mark 9, 42 ff.; Luke 17,1. 2. 

However, according to Scripture, offense is given not only by 
doing that which is evil (false doctrine, wicked life), but also 
through the unwise use of adiaphora (Rom. 14: eating meat, 
drinking wine); for in this way weak brethren may be occasioned 
to do something which their erring consciences regard as wrong. 
Rom. 14, 20: “It is evil for that man who eateth with offense”; 
14,23: “He that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth 
not of faith.” A Christian should not entertain erroneous views 
concerning adiaphora, Rom. 14, 14. 22; nevertheless, if, being 
a weak Christian, he has not the right knowledge, 1 Cor. 8, 7, he 
must under no circumstances do what he regards as wrong, Rom. 
14,15. 21. 23. 

From this follows the general rule of Christian conduct that 
believers must at all times be willing to yield their Christian liberty 
unless the truth of the Gospel is at stake, Gal. 5,1.12. But if a per¬ 
son who claims to be weak in Christian knowledge demands that 
his error should be acknowledged as truth and insists upon promul¬ 
gating it as such, he is no longer a “weak brother,” whose “weak¬ 
ness” can be tolerated, but a false prophet, who judges and con¬ 
demns true believers for using their right knowledge, Col. 2,16; 
Gal. 5,1—3. If a person takes offense because a confessing Chris- 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


227 


tian is compelled to use his Christian liberty on account of the 
confession involved, no guilt attaches to such a Christian for using 
his liberty for the Gospel’s sake. The guilt rather attaches to those 
who compel the true Christian to insist upon his liberty, Gal. 2, 4. 5; 
cp. with Acts 16, 3. 

On the basis of Scripture we rightly distinguish between an 
offense which is given and one which is taken. An offense is taken 
when a person who is spiritually blind and corrupt takes occasion 
to sin from words or acts which in themselves are right. Thus 
the Jews were offended at Christ and His Gospel because of their 
self-righteousness, Rom. 9, 32, while the Gentiles were offended at 
Christ Crucified because of their carnal pride, 1 Cor. 1, 22. 23. This 
type of offense will continue till the end of time, Luke 2, 34; Rom. 
9, 33; 1 Pet. 2, 8. Christians are offended at Christ when they 
renounce Him because of the suffering which His confession en¬ 
tails, Matt. 24, 10; 13, 21. It is for this reason that Christ so 
earnestly warns His followers: “Blessed is he whosoever shall not 
be offended in Me,” Matt. 11,6. 

4. THE DOCTRINE OF OBDURATION. 

Whenever ungodly men take offense at the preaching of the 
divine Word in such a manner that the more they hear, the more 
they resist the Holy Spirit, they are said to harden their hearts 
against the divine truth, Ex. 8,16; Ps. 95, 8; John 12, 40. In the 
process of hardening degrees may be recognized, so that not every 
case of obduracy is beyond recovery, Acts 3,14—17. As God is not 
the cause of the offense which is taken at His Word, so He is not 
the cause of the hardening of those who refuse to believe, Acts 7, 
51—54, though Scripture speaks also of obduration as an act of 
God, Ex. 7, 3; Rom. 1, 24—26. The direct cause of obduration is 
a) the devil, who blinds the human mind and fills the heart with 
wickedness, 2 Cor. 4, 4; Acts 5, 3; Eph. 2, 2; and b) man himself, 
who of his own will rejects divine grace, Matt. 13,15; 23,37, 
while God hardens man not causally, but judicially and permis- 
sively, Rom. 1, 24. 26; Acts 7,42. Hence the divine act of obdu¬ 
ration may be described as a judicial act of God by which, on 
account of antecedent, voluntary, and persistent wickedness, He 
justly permits the obstinate sinner to harden himself by withdraw¬ 
ing from him His Holy Spirit and delivering him into the power 
of Satan, Luke 22, 3. 



228 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


5. THE SCRIPTURAL DOCTRINE OF TEMPTATION. 

According to Scripture there is a) a temptation for good 
(tentatio probationis) and b) a temptation for evil (tentatio 
seductionis) . The first comes from God and is designed for the 
trial and strengthening of faith, Gen. 22, 1—18; Deut. 13, Iff.; 
Ps. 66,10 f. By sending tentationes probationis upon His children, 
God does not become the author of sin; for a) He proportions all 
trials to the strength of His saints, 1 Cor. 10,13, and b) sustains 
His beloved most graciously in their faith whenever they are 
tempted, Luke 22, 31. 32; 1 Cor. 10,13. For this reason those 
who resist and overcome temptation do so not by their own strength 
or worthiness, but solely by the grace of God, Rom. 11,20—22; 
2 Cor. 12, 9. 

Temptations for evil (tentationes seductionis) come a) from 
the devil. Matt. 4, Iff.; 1 Pet. 5,8; b) from the world, 1 John 2, 
15—17; and c) from the flesh, Jas. 1,14; cf. 1 Thess. 3, 5; 1 Cor. 
7, 5; 1 Tim. 6, 9; Mark 14, 38. It is of great comfort to all be¬ 
lievers that Christ, who Himself was tempted, has promised to 
sustain His followers in their temptations, Heb. 2, 18; 4, 15; 
2 Pet. 2, 9. 

6. THE CLASSIFICATION OF ACTUAL SINS. 

The purpose of classifying actual sins is to point out more 
definitely and to describe more clearly the numerous transgressions 
to which the believer is subject. Job 9, 2. 3. Our interest in the 
classification is therefore entirely practical. It urges us to con¬ 
sider the manifold temptations by which Satan, the world, and 
our own flesh are bent on seducing us into vice and shame, Matt. 
26, 41; 1 Cor. 10, 12, to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of 
the flesh and spirit by daily repentance, and to perfect holiness in 
the fear of God, 2 Cor. 7,1; Heb. 12,1. 2. Hence the classifica¬ 
tion of actual sins must not be regarded as unnecessary or useless, 
but rather as highly profitable, especially since Holy Scripture 
itself distinguishes between sins, 1 John 5,16; Jas. 4,17; John 
19,11. Just because “all Scripture is profitable for . . . correction 
and instruction in righteousness,” 2 Tim. 3,16, it vividly depicts 
either by express word, 1 Cor. 5, 9—11, or by example, 2 Sam. 
11, 4. 24; Matt. 26, 48 f., the uncountable transgressions which 
threaten the Christian in his life on earth, Ps. 19,12.13. 

a. Voluntary and involuntary sins. On the basis of clear 
Scripture statements we distinguish between voluntary and in- 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAX. 


229 


voluntary sins. The former (peccata voluntaria, malitiae, pro- 
aeretica) are such sinful acts in which man transgresses the divine 
Law by a deliberate volition, contrary to the dictates of conscience, 
John 13,26.27.30. The latter (peccata involuntaria) are such 
sinful acts as are committed without sure knowledge (peccata 
ignorantiae, 1 Tim. 1, 13) or without a deliberate purpose of 
the will ( peccata infirmitatis, peccata praecipitantiae, Luke 22, 
55—62). Involuntary sins are accordingly divided into sins of 
ignorance and of infirmity. However, only in the case of Chris¬ 
tians do we speak of sins of infirmity, since all unbelievers, being 
dead in trespasses and sins, Eph. 2,1, and captive in the power of 
Satan, Eph. 2, 2; 2 Tim. 2, 26, desire the very sins into which 
they are misled by the devil, Eph. 2,3; John 8,44. But the be¬ 
liever, as a new creature in Christ, 2 Cor. 5,17, detests the sins 
which he commits, Rom. 7,15, and earnestly wills that which is 
good, Rom. 7,19. 22—24. As sins of infirmity, or involuntary sins, 
we must regard also the sinful emotions, that is, the inordinate 
thoughts and desires (motus inordinati subitanei), which suddenly 
arise in Christians out of their carnal heart (oapf) without and 
against their will, Gal. 5,17. 24. (Cp. Luther, St. L., IX, 1032.) 
Infants cannot be said to be guilty of deliberate sins ( peccata pro- 
aeretica; Deut. 1, 39; Jonah 4,11); but they may not be declared 
free from actual sins, because they are flesh born of the flesh, John 
3, 6, and as such always in opposition to the divine will, Gal. 5,17; 
Gen. 8, 21; Ps. 51, 5. On the other hand, also in infants the Holy 
Spirit, through the means of grace (Baptism, Titus 3, 5) works 
faith. Matt. 18, 6, and the works of faith, Ps. 8, 2, so that they, 
as new creatures in Christ, resist the evil emotions of the flesh. 
Matt. 18, 3. 4. 

Voluntary sins must be considered not only with respect to 
the will, but also with respect to conscience. For this reason we 
regard as voluntary sins also those committed against conscience. 
These are fourfold, inasmuch as a person may sin a) against a cor¬ 
rect conscience (conscientia recta), which is in agreement with the 
divine Law, Rom. 1,32; or b) against an erring conscience (con¬ 
scientia erronea), in which case he sins both when he disregards 
(Rom. 14,14; 1 Cor. 8, 7.10—12) and when he follows his mis¬ 
guided conscience, which is at variance with the divine Word. An 
erring conscience therefore leads to sin both when it is obeyed 
and when it is disobeyed (cp. the case of a person who is bound by 
his conscience to worship saints); or c) against a probable con- 



230 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


science (conscientia probabilis), as in that case he either neglects 
the duty of ascertaining the right course of action, Ps. 119, 9.11, 
or acts in doubt, Kom. 14, 23; or d) against a doubting conscience 
(conscientia dubia), since in such cases he should not act at all, 
Eom. 14, 23. 

b. Sins of commission and of omission. Sins of commission 
(peccata commissionis) are positive acts, by which negative pre¬ 
cepts of God are violated. Sins of omission (peccata omissionis) 
consist in the neglect of acts prescribed by affirmative precepts 
of God (Hollaz). In sins of commission accordingly that is done 
which God has forbidden, Ex. 20,13—17; in sins of omission that 
is omitted which God demands, Jas. 4,17. Although sins of omis¬ 
sion are not always done intentionally or by an express purpose of 
the perverted will, yet every omission of that which is good is 
a sin in the true sense of the term, since man has been created 
for the very purpose of serving God by always doing that which 
is good, t. e., commanded by Him. Ipsum non facere, quod prae- 
ceptum, peccatum est, Matt. 28, 20; Ezek. 37, 24. 

c. Sins against God, against the neighbor, and against oneself. 
Sins against God are those which are directed against the First 
Table of the Decalog, Matt. 22, 37. 38; Gen. 39, 9. Sins against 
the neighbor are directed specifically against the Second Table, 
Matt. 22, 39; Lev. 19,17. Sins against oneself are those which, 
like fornication and impurity in general, defile the body, 1 Cor. 
6,18. Nevertheless we must remember that every sin against the 
neighbor or against oneself is a sin only because it is primarily 
committed against God, Ps. 51,4; Gen. 39, 9. Omne peccatum in 
Deum committitur. 

d. Grievous and less grievous sins. Every transgression of the 
divine Law is rebellion against God ( dvofiia, lawlessness, VBte) 
and therefore damnable, Gal. 3,10. From the viewpoint of dam- 
nability therefore we cannot speak of “smaller” and “greater” sins. 
Still Scripture itself distinguishes degrees in sinning (John 19,11, 
fid^ova d/uagTiav). Children before the years of discretion (anni 
discretionis) are less culpable than are adults, Deut. 1, 39. Ser¬ 
vants who know the will of the Lord and yet refuse to do it shall 
be beaten with many stripes, Luke 12,47, while such as sin against 
Him in ignorance shall receive only few stripes, v. 48. From this it 
is clear that as there are degrees in sinning, there are degrees also 
in the eternal punishment which the damned will suffer. The most 
grievous of all sins is unbelief, John 3,18.19; 16, 9.—The classifi- 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


281 


cation of sins into sins of the heart, of the mouth, and of the actual 
deed (peccata cordis, oris, operis) does not always indicate degree, 
since a sin of the heart (unbelief, implacability, etc.) may be more 
grievous than a sin of the mouth or of the actual deed (cf. an angry 
word spoken in haste; an evil deed done without malice, on the 
spur of the moment). When judging whether one sin is more 
grievous than another, we must consider a) the person sinning; 
b) the impelling cause; c) the object involved; d) the Law 
violated; and e) the consequence of the sin. Nevertheless every 
sin renders man guilty before God, Rom. 3,19. 

e. Mortal and venial sins. Mortal sins (peccata mortalia) are 
all sins which actually precipitate the transgressor into a state of 
wrath, death, and condemnation, so that, if he should die without 
repentance, his punishment would be eternal death, John 8, 21. 24; 
Rom. 8, 13. All sins of unbelievers are mortal sins since unbe¬ 
lievers reject Christ, for whose sake alone God pardons sin, Rom. 
3, 24; Eph. 1, 7; Acts 4,12. When we speak of mortal sins of “be¬ 
lievers,” we mean such sins as grieve the Holy Spirit, Eph. 4, 30, 
and destroy faith (David’s murder and adultery, Ps. 32, 3. 4). 
“A mortal sin is that by which the regenerate, overcome by the 
flesh and not remaining in a regenerate state, transgress the divine 
Law by a deliberate purpose of the will, contrary to the dictates 
of conscience, and thereby lose saving faith, reject the gracious 
influence of the Holy Spirit, and cast themselves into a state of 
wrath, death, and condemnation.” (Hollaz.)—Venial sins (pec¬ 
cata venialia) are the involuntary sins of believers, which, though 
in themselves deserving eternal death, are forgiven for Christ’s 
sake, in whom the believer trusts and in whose strength he con¬ 
tinually repents of his sins, Ps. 19,12.13; 51, 9—12. 

On this point the papists err, who teach that certain sins are 
in themselves mortal (superbia, avaritia, luxuria, ira, gula, invidia, 
acedia), while others in themselves are venial and so deserve only 
temporal punishments. The Calvinists err in this matter by teach¬ 
ing that the elect never lose faith or fall from grace, even when 
they commit enormous sins (peccata enormia). 

With mortal sins may be identified the so-called dominant 
and with venial sins the so-called non-dominant sins. In unbe¬ 
lievers all sins are dominant, since they are dead in trespasses 
and sins and are in the power of Satan, Eph. 2,1—3. The blessed 
state in which sin is no longer dominant in man is found in be¬ 
lievers only, Rom. 6, 12. 14. If believers give up the struggle 



232 


THE DOCTRINE OP MAN. 


against sin. Gal. 5,16.17, so that it again reigns over them, they 
have fallen from grace and lost faith. Gal. 5,4; 1 Cor. 5,11. 

f. Crying sins. Crying sins (peccata clamantia) are such as 
invoke God’s punishments in a special degree. Examples of crying 
sins mentioned in Scripture are the following: a) the fratricide 
committed by Cain, Gen. 4,10; b) the sins of the Sodomites, Gen. 
18, 20; c) the oppression of the Israelites by the Egyptians, 
Ex. 3,9; d) the oppression of widows and orphans, Ex. 22, 22. 23; 
e) the withholding of wages from hired laborers, Jas. 5,4; f) the 
persecution of Christians, Rev. 6, 9.10. In general, we may de¬ 
scribe as crying sins all crimes committed against the helpless 
(widows, orphans, the poor, the oppressed, etc.), whose cause God 
Himself must champion and defend, Ex. 3, 7—9; 22, 21—24; 
Is. 3,13—15. 

Clamitat ad coelutn vow sanguinis ei Sodomorum, 

Vow oppressorum, viduae, pretium famulorum. 

g. Pardonable sins and the unpardonable sin. A pardonable 
sin (peccatum remissibile) is a sin of which it is possible to repent, 
while the “unpardonable sin” (peccatum irremissibile) excludes the 
possibility of repentance. Since all sins are pardonable except the 
sin against the Holy Ghost, Matt. 12, 31. 32; Mark 3, 22—30; 
Luke 12,10, which is the only irremissible sin that Scripture re¬ 
cords, this sin requires special consideration. However, the classi¬ 
fication just given must not be abused in the interest of carnal 
security and indifference toward sin. Every sin is pardonable 
only if the sinner in true repentance trusts in the vicarious satis¬ 
faction of Christ. It is only from the viewpoint of divine grace 
that sins are pardonable, not from that of human merit, Rom. 
4, 5—8. There is no “guiltless sin” before God, Rom. 3, 19; 
Gal. 3,10. 

h. The sin against the Holy Ohost. The sin against the Holy 
Ghost is described in Scripture as <f blasphemy against the Holy 
Ghost,” Mark 3, 28. 29. This blasphemy is distinguished from that 
directed against Christ, Matt. 12, 32, which, as our Savior expressly 
teaches, is pardonable. As Scripture references to the sin against 
the Holy Ghost our dogmaticians consider also 1 John 5,16 and 
Heb.6,4—6; 10,26.27. 

The sin against the Holy Ghost is unpardonable because it is 
directed, not against the divine person of the Holy Ghost, but 
against His divine office or His gracious operation upon the human 
heart. Peccatum in Spiritum Sanctum non in personam, sed in 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


23J 


officium Spiritus Sancti committitur. That is the nature, or 
essence, of this sin. However, not every resistance against the work 
of the Holy Ghost comes under the head of this sin; otherwise 
every person in the world would commit this unpardonable sin, 
since by nature all men resist the Holy Spirit, 1 Cor. 2, 14; 
Rom. 8, 7. 

The sin against the Holy Ghost is committed only when the 
Holy Spirit has clearly revealed the divine truth to the sinner and 
the sinner nevertheless utters blasphemies against it. Hence this 
sin must not be identified a) with that of final impenitence (impoe- 
nitentia finalis) nor b) with blasphemy of the divine truth flowing 
from spiritual blindness, 1 Tim. 1,13, nor c) with the denial of 
the divine truth through fear, Luke 22, 61. 62. The sin against 
the Holy Ghost consists in the perverse, persistent denial and 
rejection of the divine truth after the latter has been sufficiently 
acknowledged and accepted as such, joined with voluntary and 
atrocious blasphemy. In other words, it is the malicious and 
blasphemous rejection of the Gospel by a hardened sinner, who- 
through the gracious illumination of the Holy Ghost has been 
fully convinced of its divine truth. Hollaz writes: " Peccatum in 
Spiritum Sanctum est veritatis divinae evidenter agnitae et in 
conscientia approbatae maiitiosa abnegatio, hostilis impugnatio , 
horrenda blasphematio et omnium mediorum salutis obstinata et 
finaliter perseverans reiectio ." 

Most dogmaticians teach that the sin against the Holy Ghost 
can be committed only by those who were regenerated, though 
others, and among these Baier, maintain that it occurs also in the 
unregenerate, namely, in the very moment when the Holy Ghost 
is about to convert them and to this end convicts them of the divine 
truth. The reason why the sin against the Holy Ghost is un¬ 
pardonable is because it is malicious and persistent resistance 
against the converting and sanctifying work of the Holy Ghost, 
through which alone sinners are saved. 

The Calvinists err in teaching that the sin against the Holy 
Ghost is unpardonable for the reason that God from eternity has 
predetermined to damnation those who maliciously resist the divine 
truth. Over against this error it may be shown that Christ 
earnestly desired to save the very Pharisees who rejected His 
Word and committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, Matt. 12, 
22—32; 23, 37. 



234 


THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


The question whether the sin against the Holy Ghost still 
occurs must be answered in the affirmative, since Matt. 12, 31. 32 
and its parallel passages are general statements and so apply at 
all times. From 1 John 5,16 we conclude that in certain cases 
those who commit the sin against the Holy Ghost may be known; 
for in this passage believers are asked not to intercede for such 
(“I do not say that he,” etc.). At the same time we must not be 
hasty in charging with this sin a person who may appear to us to 
be guilty of it, but rather continue in the testimony of the truth 
as we have opportunity, warning the wrong-doer against the dread¬ 
ful offense which our Lord so strongly condemns, just as He Him¬ 
self earnestly warned the Pharisees against it. Matt. 12, 22—32. 

Whether Heb. 6, 4—6 and 10, 26. 27 treat of the sin against 
the Holy Ghost is an exegetical question, though many scholars 
believe that these two passages speak of this sin. In Heb. 12,17 
the word “repentance” refers to Isaac rather than to Esau, the 
meaning of the text being that Esau with all his tears could not 
prevail on his father to change his mind and turn Jacob’s blessing 
to his advantage, Gen. 27, 34—38. 

Only divine grace can preserve us from the sin against the 
Holy Ghost. If they were left to themselves, all who have 
come under the gracious operation of the Spirit of God would 
commit this heinous sin. Those who are in great distress of mind 
because they fear that they have committed it should take comfort 
from the fact that this unforgivable sin is committed only by such 
as maliciously spurn and blasphemously reject the grace of God in 
Christ Jesus, not, however, by any one who repents of his sins and 
longs for the forgiveness which the Gospel offers. To him apply 
such passages as Matt. 11, 28; 9,13; John 6, 37. 

1. Other classifications. 1. Secret sins and manifest sins. 
Secret sins are those which are known either to the transgressor 
alone (Ps. 32, 3—5) or besides to him only to a few others who 
either rightly (Matt. 18, 15. 16) or wrongly (Lev. 5, 1; Prov. 
29, 24) desire them to remain hidden. Open sins are such as 
have become known to many, 1 Tim. 5, 20; 1 Cor. 5, 1. This 
division is of great importance for the proper treatment of disci¬ 
plinary cases. 

2. Personal sins and foreign sins whose guilt we share. Per¬ 
sonal sins are those which the sinner himself commits, 2 Sam. 
12,13, while foreign sins whose guilt we share are transgressions 
committed by others with our knowledge, sanction, concurrence, 



THE DOCTRINE OF MAN. 


235 


or aid. We participate in the sins of others if we command, 
counsel, consent to, or connive at, their evil deeds, or do not oppose 
them nor give information concerning them, so that we become 
morally responsible for such sins, 2 Sam. 11,15—21. 

Holy Scripture warns us most emphatically against partici¬ 
pating in the sins of others, Eph. 5, 7.11; 1 Tim. 5, 22; 2 John 11; 
Rev. 18,4. In particular, believers should avoid false teachers lest 
they share in their offense of publishing false doctrine, 2 John 11; 
2 Cor. 6,14—18; Rom. 16,17.18. But we offend in this point 
also by taking pleasure in the sins of others, Rom. 1, 32. Such 
pleasure in the sins of others is awakened especially by listening to 
immoral or blasphemous conversation, 1 Cor. 15, 33; Eph. 4, 29; 
1 Tim. 6, 20; 2 Tim. 2,16, or by associating with wrong-doers in 
general (unionism, Ps. 1,1; Eph. 5,11; Ps. 26,4. 5). 



236 


THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL. 


THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL. 

(De Libero Arbitrio.) 

Among the effects of original sin we must enumerate also the 
loss of the freedom of the will in spiritual matters. The term “free 
will” (liberum arbiirium) is used in a twofold meaning. In the 
first place it denotes the faculty to will (facultas volendi), by which 
man is distinguished from all irrational creatures. Free will in this 
sense is called also formal freedom, or freedom from coercion 
(libertas a coactione). 

When we use the term in this sense, we say that man through 
the Fall has not lost his free will; for although corrupt man is so 
perverted that he cannot do otherwise than sin (non potest non 
peccare), he nevertheless sins not against his will, but of his own 
free will. In other words, he is never coerced to sin, but commits 
sin of his own choice, John 8, 44. Hutter writes: “Sometimes 
the term will, or choice, is used to designate the faculty of the 
soul, indeed the very substance of the will itself, whose function 
is simply that of willing. Thus regarded, scarcely any one will 
deny free will to man.” And Gerhard: “The question is not 
whether the essence of the will has survived the Fall; for this we 
emphatically maintain, namely, that man has not lost his will, 
but the soundness of it.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 260.) 

However, the term “free will” has been used also in the sense 
of “spiritual power” by which corrupt man can desire that which 
is spiritually good, prepare himself for divine grace, fulfil the 
divine Law out of true love for God, accept and believe the Gospel, 
and thus either convert himself entirely or at least cooperate in 
his conversion. To distinguish “free will” in this sense from the 
mere faculty of willing, dogmaticians have called it spiritual free¬ 
dom (libertas spiritualis) or material freedom. 

When the term “free will” is used in this sense, we, on the 
basis of Scripture, emphatically deny that man after the Fall 
has a “free will.” 1 Cor. 2,14: “The natural man receiveth not 
the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; 
neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned”; 
John 6, 44: “No man can come to Me except the Father which hath 
sent Me draw him”; Rom. 8, 7: “The carnal mind is enmity 
against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither 
indeed can be”; Eph. 2,1: “You hath He quickened who were 
dead in trespasses and sins.” 



THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL. 


237 


If, then, the natural man does not receive the spiritual things, 
but regards them as foolishness; indeed, if he is dead in trespasses 
and sins and is enmity against God, then certainly he is without 
the power to will that which is spiritually good, to apply himself 
to divine grace, and to prepare himself for, or to cooperate in, his 
conversion. Gerhard writes: “Understanding the term liberty as 
describing the free power and faculty of choosing the good and 
rejecting the evil that was possessed by Adam, we maintain that 
Luther was perfectly correct in saying: ‘Free will is a title without 
the thing itself, or a thing with nothing but a title.’ ” 

Similarly the Formula of Concord says: “In spiritual and 
divine things, which pertain to the salvation of the soul, man is like 
a pillar of salt, like Lot’s wife, yea, like a log and a stone, like 
a lifeless statue, which uses neither eyes nor mouth, neither sense 
nor heart. For man neither sees nor perceives the terrible and 
fierce wrath of God on account of sin and death, but ever con¬ 
tinues in his security, even knowingly and willingly. . . . All 
teaching and preaching is lost upon him until he is enlightened, 
converted, and regenerated by the Holy Ghost.” (Thor. Decl., 
11,20.21). And again: “Therefore the Scriptures deny to the 
intellect, heart, and will of the natural man all aptness, skill, 
capacity, and ability to think, to understand, to be able to do, to 
begin, to will, to undertake, to act, to work, or to concur in work¬ 
ing, anything good and right in spiritual things as of himself, 
2 Cor. 3, 5; Rom. 3, 12; John 8, 37; 1, 5; 1 Cor. 2, 14; Rom. 
8, 7: John 15, 5; Phil. 2, 13.” (Thor. Decl., II, 12—14.) 

But while our Confessions thus teach that man in spiritual 
matters has no free will, it admits on the basis of Scripture that 
the will of natural man is free in worldly affairs and even to some 
extent in the exercise of civil righteousness (iustitia civilis, car- 
nalis, operum). The Apology of the Augsburg Confession affirms: 
“The human will has liberty in the choice of works and things 
which reason comprehends by itself. It can to a certain extent 
(aliquo modo) render civil righteousness, or the righteousness of 
works; it can speak of God, offer to God a certain service by an 
outward work, obey magistrates, parents; in the choice of an 
outward work it can restrain the hands from murder, from adultery, 
from theft. Since there is left in human nature reason and judg¬ 
ment concerning objects subjected to the senses, choice between 
these things, and the liberty and power to render civil righteous¬ 
ness, are also left.” (Art. XVIII, 70.)

THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL, 


The qualification which is here made, namely, that man in 
the things enumerated has a free will only “to a certain extent” 
(aliquo modo), is very important, since by nature he is so dead in 
trespasses and sins and captive in Satan’s power, Eph. 2, 2 ; Col. 
1,13; 2 Tim. 2, 26; Acts 26,18, that his civil righteousness leaves 
much to be desired. The Apology therefore rightly adds: “The 
power of concupiscence is such that men more frequently obey evil 
dispositions than sound judgment. And the devil, who is effica¬ 
cious in the godless, as Paul says Eph. 2, 2, does not cease to incite 
this feeble nature to various offenses. These are the reasons why 
civil righteousness is rare among men, as we see that not even the 
philosophers themselves, who seem to have aspired after this 
righteousness, attained it.” (Art. XVIII, 71.) 

The Scriptural doctrine that man in spiritual matters has no 
free will at all, but is completely blind, dead, and inimical to God, 
has always been absolutely denied by synergists and Semi-Pela¬ 
gians. The Formula of Concord describes the synergistic error 
as follows: “Man is not absolutely dead to good in spiritual things, 
but is badly wounded and half dead. Therefore, although the free 
will is too weak to make a beginning and to convert itself to God 
by its own powers and to be obedient to God’s Law from the heart, 
nevertheless, when the Holy Ghost makes a beginning and calls 
us through the Gospel and offers us His grace, the forgiveness of 
sins, and eternal salvation, then the free will, from its own natural 
powers, can meet God and to a certain extent, although feebly, do 
something towards it, help, and cooperate thereto, can qualify itself 
for, and apply itself to, grace, and apprehend, accept it, and believe 
the Gospel, and can also cooperate by its own powers with the Holy 
Ghost in the continuation and maintenance of this work.” (Thor. 
Decl., II, 77.) 

In opposition to this error the Formula of Concord declares: 
“In spiritual and divine things the intellect, heart, and will of 
the unregenerate man are utterly unable by their own natural 
powers to understand, believe, accept, think, will, begin, effect, do, 
work, or concur in working, anything, but they are entirely dead 
to what is good, and corrupt, so that in man’s nature since the 
Fall, before regeneration, there is not the least spark of spiritual 
power remaining nor present, by which of himself he can prepare 
himself for God’s grace or accept the offered grace, nor be capable 
of it for and of himself, or apply or accommodate himself thereto, 
or by his own powers be able of himself, as of himself, to aid, do, 



THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL. 


239 


work, or concur in working, anything towards his conversion, either 
wholly or half or in any, even the least or most inconsiderable, 
part; but he is the servant of sin, John 8, 34, and a captive of the 
devil, by whom he is moved, Eph. 2, 2; 2 Tim. 2,26. Hence the 
natural free will according to its perverted disposition and nature 
is strong and active only with respect to what is displeasing and 
contrary to God.” (Thor. Decl., II, 7.) 

Among the arguments that have been used to oppose the 
Scripture-doctrine of man’s total loss of free will in spiritual 
matters the following may be considered as the most important: — 

1. It must be true that natural man has a free will in spiritual 
matters since St. Paul declares that the “Gentiles do by nature the 
things contained in the Law,” Rom. 2,14. — Reply: St. Paul here 
describes only the external obedience (quoad materiale) of the 
heathen and not the true obedience, which flows from faith and 
love toward God (quoad formate); for the same apostle who de¬ 
clares that the heathen do the things contained in the Law also 
declares that they are without God and without hope in the world, 
Eph. 2, 12, alienated from God, Col. 1, 21, and His enemies, 
Rom. 8, 7. While to a certain extent the heathen may exercise 
themselves in civil righteousness (iustitia civilis), they are in¬ 
capable of spiritual righteousness (iustitia spiritualis). Homo 
reiicit evangelium natura, credit gratia. 

2. Natural man must have a free will in spiritual matters, 
since God commands him to obey the Law and to believe the 
Gospel, Matt. 22, 37—39; Acts 16, 31. — Reply: From the divine 
command we must not infer the human ability to comply with the 
divine command. (A praecepto divino ad posse humanum non 
valet consequentia.) The same Word of God which demands obe¬ 
dience to the Law, Gal. 3,10, and faith in the Gospel, Mark 1,15; 
Acts 16, 31, teaches also that natural man cannot obey the Law, 
Eccl. 7, 20; Ps. 143, 2; Is. 64, 6, nor believe in Christ by his own 
strength, John 6,44; 2 Cor. 3,5. Yet neither are the commands 
of the Law (adhortationes legates) useless, Luke 10, 28, nor are the 
Gospel exhortations (adhortationes evangelicae) in vain, Matt. 

11, 28; for by the former the Holy Spirit works knowledge of sin, 
Rom. 3, 20, while by the latter He works faith, Rom. 10,17; 1 Cor. 

12, 3, so that the good and gracious will of God is actually accom¬ 
plished in the sinner, who is called to repentance, by the preaching 
of the divine Word. 

3. Natural man must have a free will in spiritual matters since 



240 


THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL. 


his conversion without his cooperation would imply coercion on 
God’s part. — Reply: The conversion of a sinner is indeed the 
work of God’s almighty power, Eph. 1,19; but it is not an irre¬ 
sistible or coercive power since it may be resisted, Matt. 23, 37. 
However, the very nature of conversion excludes the idea of co¬ 
ercion; for it consists essentially in the gracious drawing of the 
sinner by God Himself, John 6, 44, which is accomplished through 
the means of grace, Rom. 10,17. The Formula of Concord says: 
■“[We reject] also when the following expressions are employed,. . . 
namely, that . . . the Holy Ghost is given to those who resist Him 
intentionally and persistently; for, as Augustine says, in conver¬ 
sion God makes willing persons out of the unwilling and dwells in 
the willing.” (Epit., II, 15.) 

4. Natural man must have a free will in spiritual matters 
since God works only the power to believe, but not faith itself. — 
Reply: This argument is based upon a false premise; for God 
“worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure,” 
Phil. 2,13. (Cp. also Eph. 1,19; Phil. 1,29.) In other words, 
the very faith by which we are saved is God’s gracious gift and 
work in us. 

5 . Natural man must have a free will in spiritual matters; 
for without his cooperation in conversion not he, but the Holy 
Spirit would believe. — Reply: The fallacy involved in this argu¬ 
ment becomes clear when we consider that, though temporal life 
is the gift of God, bestowed upon man without his cooperation, 
yet the person so endowed with life himself lives, so that God 
does not do the living for him. It is the same with faith, which 
indeed is God’s gift, but at the same time a gift that the believer 
himself possesses. 2 Tim. 1,12: “I know whom I have believed.” 

6. Natural man must have a free will in spiritual matters 
since he can read the Bible, hear the Word of God, exercise him¬ 
self in civil righteousness, etc. — Reply: All these works are ex¬ 
ternal only, and not the fruits of true faith in Christ and of true 
love to God. The self-righteous Pharisee remained unconverted 
though he did all this and more, Luke 18,10—14. 

7. Natural man must have a free will in spiritual matters; 
for if he can damn himself by refusing to believe, it follows with 
irresistible logic that he can also save himself by desiring and 
endeavoring to believe. — Reply: Scripture teaches very emphati¬ 
cally that the one does not follow from the other, Hos. 13, 9. 

All these and other objections to divine monergism in con- 



THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL. 


241 


version flow from the carnal heart, which is as proud as it is self- 
righteous. Those who have advanced these arguments might be 
divided into three classes: — 

a) Pelagians, “who taught that man by his own powers, with¬ 
out the grace of the Holy Ghost, can turn Himself to God, believe 
the Gospel, be obedient from the heart to God’s Law, and thus 
merit the forgiveness of sins and eternal life.” (Formula of Con¬ 
cord, Epit., II, 9ff.) 

b) Semi-Pelagians (Arminians), “who teach that man by his 
own powers can make a beginning of his conversion, but without 
the grace of God cannot complete it.” (Ibid.) 

c) Synergists, who teach “that, ... if the Holy Ghost by the 
preaching of the Word has made a beginning and therein offered 
His grace, then the will of man from its own natural powers can 
add something, though little and feebly, to this end, can help and 
cooperate, qualify, and prepare itself for grace, and embrace and 
accept it, and believe the Gospel.” (Ibid.) 

From the gross synergism of Melanchthon, who taught that 
man can cooperate in his conversion by his natural powers, we 
distinguish the subtle synergism of the later dogmaticians (Later- 
mann), which claims that man can cooperate in his conversion 
with spiritual powers bestowed on him by the Holy Ghost. Both 
types place the cause of conversion and salvation in man himself. 
But man cooperates towards his conversion neither by natural nor 
by spiritual powers; not by natural powers, since by nature he is 
an enemy of God; and not by spiritual powers bestowed upon 
him, since he is already converted as soon as he is in possession 
of spiritual powers. 

Regarding this point the Formula of Concord teaches: 
“Through this means, namely, the preaching and hearing of His 
Word, God works and breaks our hearts and draws man, so that 
through the preaching of the Law he comes to know his sins and 
God’s wrath and experiences in his heart true terrors, contrition, 
and sorrow, and through the preaching and consideration of the 
holy Gospel concerning the gracious forgiveness of sins in Christ 
a spark of faith is kindled in him, which accepts the forgiveness 
of sins for Christ’s sake and comforts itself with the promise of 
the Gospel; and thus the Holy Ghost (who works all this) is sent 
into the heart, Gal. 4, 6.” (Thor. Decl., II, 54.)

THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN 

MANKIND. 


(Dei Gratia erga Homines Lapsos.) 


1. THE NECESSITY OF DIVINE GRACE. 

According to the express teaching of Holy Scripture no man 
after the Fall can be justified and saved by the deeds of the Law, 
or through good works. Rom. 3, 20: “By the deeds of the Law 
there shall no flesh be justified in His sight.” All who endeavor 
to acquire salvation by the works of the Law shall not be justified, 
but damned. Gal. 3,10: “As many as are of the works of the Law 
are under the curse.” The reason for this is that no man after 
the Fall can fulfil the divine Law or satisfy the claims of divine 
justice. Rom. 3, 10: “There is none righteous, no, not one”; 
3, 23: “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” 
Hence, so far as the divine Law is concerned, all men after the 
Fall are forever lost and condemned. Matt. 19, 26; Rom. 8, 3. 4. 

Yet, as Scripture clearly teaches, it is the gracious will of 
God that not a single sinner in the world be lost, 2 Pet. 3, 9; 
1 Tim. 2, 4. For this reason God has most mercifully provided 
a way of salvation by which every sinner can be saved, John 3,16; 
Matt. 18,11, namely, the way of grace, through faith in Christ, 
without the works of the Law. Rom. 3, 24: “Being justified freely 
by His grace, diogeav zfj avzov x®Q lTl > through the redemption, 
did zfjs dnoXvzQcoaecog, the ransom, that is in Christ Jesus”; Eph. 
2, 8. 9; “By grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of 
yourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should 
boast.” This gracious way of salvation is revealed in the Gospel, 
for which reason this is called “the Gospel of the grace of God,” 
Acts 20, 24. The doctrine of salvation by grace through faith is 
both the basic and the distinctive article of Christianity, by which 
it is distinguished from all man-made religions as the only true 
and divine religion, Mark 16,15.16; Acts 4,12; for whereas all 
man-made religions teach salvation by works, Christianity pro¬ 
claims as its central and fundamental message the gracious remis¬ 
sion of sin through faith in Christ Jesus, Acts 10, 43; 26,18. 

Since sinful man is saved alone by grace, the Scriptural state¬ 
ments that sinners are saved by the Gospel, Rom. 1,16, or by Bap¬ 
tism, 1 Pet. 3, 21, or by faith, Luke 7, 50, must all be understood 
in relation to saving grace. In particular, they are descriptive of 



THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


243 


the means by which saving grace is conferred and appropriated 
without any merit, or work, on the part of the sinner. To be saved 
by the Gospel, by Baptism, by faith, etc., means to be saved by 
grace, without the deeds of the Law, through the divinely appointed 
means, by which alone the merits of Christ can be received. 

From the viewpoint of fallen man we speak of the necessity 
of divine grace, since without grace it is impossible for the sinner 
to be saved. However, from the viewpoint of God divine grace 
must be viewed, not as necessary, but as free, because God was not 
moved by any necessity inherent in His essence to save guilty man¬ 
kind, but alone by His mercy and compassion, John 3,16; Luke 
1, 78. Deus est causa libera beatitudinis nostrae. The view that 
the redemption of the world was a necessary unfolding of the divine 
essence must be rejected as a pantheistic delusion. 

2. DEFINITION OF DIVINE GRACE. 

Saving grace ( gratia salvifica, x&Q 1 ? ocoxygioc), by which God 
is moved to forgive sin and to bestow salvation upon fallen man¬ 
kind, is His gracious disposition (gratuitus Dei favor), or benev¬ 
olent inclination, mediated through Christ’s vicarious atonement, 
revealed in the Gospel, and witnessed to the world in order that 
it may be believed by all men, Rom. 3, 24. 25; John 20, 31. 
Luther: “God’s love or favor, which He cherishes toward us in 
Himself”; “Gottes Huld oder Gunst, die er zu tins traegt bei sich 
selbst” Gratia Dei aliquid in Deo, sc. affectus Dei benevolus, est 
non quaXitas animi in hominibus. Synonyms of grace, in this 
sense, are love (John 3,16), mercy (Titus 3,5), kindness (Titus 
3,4), etc., all of which describe more fully God’s benevolent dis¬ 
position by which He is moved not to condemn, but to save, fallen 
mankind by faith in His beloved Son. 

Although the term grace properly denotes God’s unmerited 
favor in Christ Jesus, Scripture uses it also to describe the spir¬ 
itual gifts or excellences which God, as the gracious Lord, works 
in all believers and by virtue of which they begin to fulfil the Law 
(willing and faithful service, 1 Pet. 4,10; patience in suffering, 
1 Pet. 2,19; conscientious administration of the office of the min¬ 
istry, Rom. 15, 15. 16; etc.). In this case the effect, by way of 
metonymy, is named after the cause, or the gifts of grace are 
named after their divine Source. Nomen gratiae per metonymiam 
[effectus pro causa\ pro donis ex benevolentia Dei in nos collatis 
sumitur. 



244 


THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


Grace in this sense must be definitely excluded as a cause of 
forgiveness of sin and salvation, since Scripture teaches expressly 
that the sinner is justified and saved without the deeds of the Law, 
Eom. 3, 28; Eph. 2, 8. 9. The believer owes his salvation not to 
inherent or infused grace, or the grace which is in him, but alone 
to the benevolent disposition in God, or the gratuitus Dei favor. 
In other words, when we say that we are saved by grace, we do 
not refer to divine grace as it exerts itself in us, but as it is found 
outside of us, in God. So also faith does not justify and save 
either as a good quality (nova qualitas), or as a good work (opus 
per se dignum), or as a gift of God (donum Spiritus Sancii), or 
as a source of good works in us, but alone as the receiving means 
(Sgyavov Xrjmixov), by which man, who in himself is ungodly, 
appropriates to himself the grace of God and the merits of Christ 
through implicit trust in the promises of the Gospel. 

In short, faith justifies solely by virtue of its object, which is 
Jesus Christ, the Crucified, Gal. 2,16; 1 Cor.'2, 2. Luther: Non 
per se aut virtute aliqua intrinseca fides iustificat, sed simpliciter 
quatenus habet se correlative ad Christum. This truth Scripture 
teaches clearly by placing faith in opposition to works whenever 
it describes the way in which the sinner is justified. Rom. 4,5: 
“To him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth 
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness”; Eph. 2, 8. 9: 
“By grace are ye saved, through faith, . . . not of works.” 

This sharp distinction between grace as God’s unmerited favor 
and grace as a gift of God (donum gratiae) in the article of justi¬ 
fication is of the greatest importance; for all who teach that grace 
in the sense of infused grace (gratia infusa) is either the sole or 
a concomitant cause of justification inculcate salvation by works 
and have fallen from grace, Gal. 5,4. In reality, while retaining 
the Christian terminology, they are teaching the paganistic doc¬ 
trine of work-righteousness. 

This pernicious mingling of grace and the gifts of grace is 
the basic error of the Roman Catholic Church, which in the Deci¬ 
sions of the Council of Trent (Sess. VI, Can. XI) has anathema¬ 
tized the definition of justifying grace as gratuitus Dei favor, from 
which infused grace must be rigidly excluded. But also the Re¬ 
formed are obliged to rely on infused grace for justification since 
they deny that God’s grace (gratia universalis) is seriously offered 
to all sinners in the Gospel and the Sacraments. They are there¬ 
fore compelled to rely for the personal assurance of their justifies- 



THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


245 


tion on something within themselves or upon their renewal, or 
their good works, in short, upon infused grace. The same is true 
of all enthusiasts who assume a revealing and sanctifying operation 
of the Holy Ghost outside the divinely appointed means of grace 
(the Word and the Sacraments), no matter by what names they 
may be known. Zwingli, in Fidei Ratio: “Dux autem vel vehicw- 
lum Spiritui non est necessarium Since in this case the believer 
cannot rely for justification and salvation on the objective promises 
of God, he must rely on the feeling of grace (sensus gratiae) within 
his heart, or upon divine grace as it exerts itself in him. 

It is true, wherever the grace of God in Christ Jesus is 
accepted in true faith, there good works must needs follow, and 
at times there will also be the comforting feeling of divine grace. 
But if the believer puts his trust in his spiritual renewal or in the 
presence of grace in his heart, Christ’s perfect work of redemption, 
or the objective reconciliation effected by Him, 2 Cor. 5, 19, is 
denied. But then also the essence of justifying faith, which is 
trust in the objective divine promises of grace. Bom. 4, 18. 25, 
is denied. In the final analysis, then, also the certainty of salva¬ 
tion must be denied; for if salvation is based upon good works, 
such a person’s hope of heaven is absolutely futile. 

By reaffirming the true definition of justifying grace as 
gratuitus Dei favor and excluding from it the false conception of 
infused grace, correcting in this respect even St. Augustine, the 
Church of the Beformation returned to the apostolic purity of the 
Christian faith. The confessional Lutheran Church of America 
follows in the footsteps of the great Beformer and in the article 
of justification sharply distinguishes between grace and the gifts 
of grace, or between God’s unmerited favor and its benefactions 
in the believer’s heart. For this reason it constantly bears witness 
not only against Catholicism, Zwinglianism, and enthusiasm, but 
also against synergism (Arminianism), which denies the sola gratia 
and places the cause of man’s justification to some extent in him 
(aliquid in homine), thus inducing him to trust for salvation both 
in divine grace and in human goodness. 

While the synergists include man’s moral conduct, or his self¬ 
decision, or his right attitude toward grace, in justifying faith, 
the Arminians insist that justifying faith embraces also the good 
works of believers. According to their teaching the believer, seek¬ 
ing assurance of his salvation, must trust in the divine grace within 
himself (gratia infnsa), or in his sanctification. 



246 


THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN* MANKIND. 


From the above it is obvious how important it is for the 
Christian theologian to maintain the Scriptural definition of justi¬ 
fying grace; for without it he can neither teach the true doctrine 
of justification as revealed in the Gospel nor exclude from justifica¬ 
tion the doctrine of salvation by good works, nor can he rightly 
comfort any sinner who seeks assurance of salvation. Hence, wher¬ 
ever the Scriptural doctrine of justifying grace is perverted, the 
entire Christian doctrine becomes corrupted and paganized. It is 
for this reason that Luther and all orthodox Lutheran theologians 
so earnestly insisted upon having this Bible doctrine taught in the 
Church, that justifying grace is God’s unmerited favor in Christ 
Jesus. The Apology declares: “It is necessary that in the Church 
of Christ the Gospel be retained, t. e., the promise that for Christ’s 
sake sins are freely remitted. Those who teach nothing of this 
faith . . . altogether abolish the Gospel. (Art. IV (II), 120. 
Triglotta, p. 155.) Chemnitz says: " Gratia in articulo iustifica- 
tionis intelligenda est de sola gratuita misericordia Dei." With 
this definition of justifying grace the Christian Church stands or 
falls (articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae). 

3. ATTRIBUTES OF JUSTIFYING GRACE. 

The attributes, or adjuncts, of justifying grace are as follows: 

a. Justifying grace is grace in Christ. Justifying grace is not 
absolute grace, or grace bestowed upon the sinner by a fiat of the 
divine sovereign will, but grace mediated through Christ, or grace 
in or for the sake of Christ. In other words, according to Scrip¬ 
ture, God is gracious to sinful and condemned mankind only in 
view of the fact that the incarnate Son of God through His vica¬ 
rious atonement (satisfactio vicaria) has ransomed all sinners 
from the curse and condemnation of the Law. Rom. 3, 24: “Being 
justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in 
Christ Jesus.” The price which Christ paid for the redemption 
of guilty mankind was that He of His own free will placed Him¬ 
self both under the obligation (Gal. 4,4. 5, obedientia activa) and 
the curse and punishment (Gal. 3,13, obedientia passiva) of the 
divine Law which man had violated. 

Divine grace therefore does not exclude divine justice (iustitia 
Dei vindicativa), but rather presupposes or implies the satisfaction 
of its demands through Christ’s vicarious death, Rom. 8, 3. 4. For 
this reason the Gospel, which offers divine grace to all men, Titus 
2,11, is not a message of grace apart from Christ’s death (Mod- 



THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


247 


ernists, rationalists, Harnack: “The Son of God does not belong 
into the Gospel”), but “the Word of Reconciliation,” Xoyog tfjg 
xaraXXayfjg, 2 Cor. 5, 19, that is, the unique message that God 
“hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ,” or that “God 
was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.” 

Scripture thus leaves no room for grace without the payment 
of the penalty of man’s sin. God neither forgives sin by ignoring 
His justice, nor does He accept the worthless ransom-price (good 
works), which men offer Him to satisfy the eternal claims of His 
justice. Divine grace for sinners could be secured only through 
the unspeakable sacrifice of Christ’s vicarious obedience, Heb. 7, 
26. 27; Eph. 2, 13—16; Col. 1, 20—22. Hence the axiom: 
“Divine grace and human merit exclude each other; but divine 
grace includes the divine merits of Christ.” 

Luther very aptly writes on this subject: “I have often said 
before that faith in God alone is not sufficient, for also the costs 
must be paid. The Turks and the Jews also believe in God, but 
without the means and the costs. And what is the cost? That 
the Gospel shows. . . . Christ here teaches that we are not lost, 
but have eternal life, that is, that God so loved us that He was 
willing to pay the cost, the putting of His only, beloved Child into 
our misery, into hell and death, which He made Him drink to the 
dregs.” (St. L., XI, 1085ff.) Again: “Though grace is given to 
us for nothing, so that it does not cost us anything, yet it cost 
some one else on our behalf very much; for it has been secured 
through an uncountable, infinite treasure, namely, through God’s 
Son Himself.” (Ibid.) 

Such questions as, “Could not God be gracious to men because 
of His sovereign power as supreme Judge, without Christ’s atone¬ 
ment?” or, “Is it not a thought unworthy of God that His grace 
toward sinners had first to be purchased by the perfect obedience 
of His Son?” are both useless and foolish; for the fact that God 
is gracious to sinners only for Christ’s sake is emphatically stated 
in His Word and must be believed by all men if they desire to 
obtain divine grace and eternal life, 2 Cor. 5, 18—20. All who 
teach that God is gracious to sinners without the death of Christ 
(Unitarians, Modernists, Ritschl, Harnack, etc.) reject the Chris¬ 
tian faith, champion pagan doctrine, and are outside the pale of 
the Christian Church; for the Christian Church is the communion 
of believers who trust in the gracious remission of their sins through 
the blood of Christ, Gal. 3, 26; Eph. 1, 7. So Chemnitz writes: 



248 


THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


Extra Christum nulla gratia et misericordia Dei erga peccatores 
nec debet nec potest recte cogitari. {Harm. Ev., c. 28, p. 152.) 
Hence those who deny Christ’s vicarious atonement likewise deny 
the grace of God. 

However, divine grace is denied also by those who claim that 
Christ’s atonement was in itself not adequate as a ransom, but was 
declared and accepted as such for the acquittal of the sinner by 
God’s own mere volition (the theory of acceptilation; Scotists, 
Arminians). This theory, in the final analysis, ascribes the for¬ 
giveness of sins to God’s sovereign will and thus reduces the value 
of Christ’s vicarious suffering and death. But Scripture bases 
divine grace not merely in part, but wholly on Christ’s atoning 
work, so that there is no grace for sinners but that which is in 
Christ Jesus, Rom. 3, 24; Acts 4,12. According to Scripture the 
expression “the Gospel of the grace of God” (Acts 20, 24) and 
“Jesus Christ and Him crucified” (1 Cor. 2, 2) are synonymous, so 
that he who preaches the one must preach also the other. 

The Augsburg Confession emphasizes this truth when it says: 
“Also they teach that men cannot be justified before God by their 
own strength, merits, or works, but are freely justified for Christ’s 
sake, through faith, when they believe that they are received into 
favor and that their sins are forgiven for Christ’s sake, who by 
His death has made satisfaction for our sins. This faith God im¬ 
putes for righteousness in His sight, Rom. 3 and 4.” (Art. IV. 
Cp. also Luther, St. L., XII, 261 ff.) 

b. Justifying grace is universal (gratia universalis). The un¬ 
merited favor and love of God in Christ Jesus extends not merely 
to some (the elect), but to all men without exception. Gratia Dei 
salvifica erga homines lapsos non particularis, sed universalis est. 
This paramount truth Scripture teaches in all passages in which it 
declares a) that Christ is the Savior of the whole world, of all men, 
John 3,16; 1,29; 1 John 2, 2; 1 Tim. 2, 4; Titus 2,11; b) that 
God earnestly desires that each individual person be saved, 2 Pet. 
3,9; Ezek. 33,11; 18,23.32; c) that salvation has been secured 
even for those who reject the grace of God and are thus lost on 
account of their unbelief, Matt. 23, 37; Acts 7,51; 1 Cor. 8,11; 
2 Pet. 2,1. The universality of divine grace is denied by all who 
limit the purpose and efficacy of divine grace to the elect (par¬ 
ticularism, gratia particularis). 

These errorists may be divided into three groups: a) Supra- 
lapsarians: God decreed to create some to damnation; b) Infra- 



THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND.

lapsarians: God decreed to leave some in the state of damnation 
into which they had fallen through their own fault (praeteritio) ; 
c) Amyraldists: God indeed offers grace to all, but bestows faith 
only upon the elect. 

Every form of particularism is anti-Scriptural, being based 
upon the fallacy that, since not all men are actually saved, God 
does not desire the salvation of all. Misled by their error, all par- 
ticularists claim that the term world (John 3,16; 1, 29) signifies 
“the elect,” and they substitute for God’s universal counsel of grace 
(1 Tim. 2, 4) a voluntas signi, in opposition to which stands His 
voluntas beneplaciti. That is to say, God indeed wishes to save 
all men according to that will which He has revealed in Scripture 
(voluntas signi > the revealed will); but by His secret will (voluntas 
beneplaciti, the will of His purpose), which is not revealed in 
Scripture, He wishes to save only the elect. 

According to Calvinistic doctrine, God, in the final analysis, 
is the cause why some are not saved, while Scripture expressly 
teaches that those who are not saved perish through their unbelief, 
or rejection of divine grace, Luke 7, 30; Acts 13,46; 7, 51; Matt. 
23, 37. Charles Hodge writes: “It cannot be supposed that God 
intends what is never accomplished; that He purposes what He 
does not intend to effect. ... If all men are not saved, God never 
purposed their salvation and never devised, and put into operation, 
means designed to accomplish that end. We must assume that 
the result is the interpretation of the purposes of God." ( System¬ 
atic Theol., II, 323.) 

In order to support the doctrine of particularism, the Synod 
of Dort (1618—19) declared that God can never be resisted when¬ 
ever He earnestly offers His grace to men (irresistible grace). 
But also this doctrine is anti-Scriptural; for Scripture affirms that 
the operation of the Holy Spirit through the Gospel can be resisted. 
Acts 7, 51; Matt. 23, 37, though the operation is itself one of 
divine power, Eph. 1,19. 20. As in the realm of grace God can 
be resisted when He works through means, so also in the realm of 
nature; for life, which is originated and sustained alone by divine 
omnipotence, Acts 17, 28, can nevertheless be destroyed by feeble 
man. God indeed cannot be resisted when He deals with man 
in His sovereign majesty (Luther: in nuda maiestate, Matt. 
25, 31 ff.); but when He approaches man through means, resis¬ 
tance on his part is always possible. 

If the objection is raised that God becomes the cause of a 



250 


THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


sinner’s damnation at least in cases where He hardens his heart 
(cf. the divine judgment of obduration), we reply that according 
to Scripture God very earnestly offers His grace even to those who 
harden their hearts, Rom. 10,21; Ex. 5, Iff. The divine judgment 
of obduration is never absolute or arbitrary; God hardens only 
those who first have hardened themselves by resisting His Word 
And will, Rom. 11, 7. 20. 

c. Justifying grace is serious and efficacious (gratia seria et 
officax). In spite of the fact that divine grace can be resisted 
(gratia resistibilis), we must not regard it as a "fruitless wish” 
or an “indifferent complacency by which God does not desire to 
effect or obtain the things which please Him” (otiosa complacentia, 
nuda velleitas), but as both serious and efficacious. That is to say, 
God seriously purposes, by sufficient and efficacious means, to effect 
the salvation of all men, Rom. 2,4; 1,16. 

This truth is proved from a) the divine command to preach 
the Gospel to every creature, Mark 16,15.16, and make disciples 
of all nations, Matt. 28, 19. 20, which certainly must not be con¬ 
strued as mockery on the part of God; b) His divine promise to 
grant His Holy Spirit to all who hear His Word in order that He 
may work in them saving faith, Zech. 12,10; Acts 2,17.18; Ezek. 
11,19. 20; 36, 26. 27; Acts 2, 38; 7, 51; c) His comforting as¬ 
surance that He will not only begin, but also perform, finish, the 
good work in all believers, Phil. 1, 6; and d) His most serious 
endeavor to work faith in those who resist the Holy Spirit, Matt. 
23, 37; Acts 7, 51, so that, if the wicked perish, they do so solely 
through their unbelief, 2 Cor. 4, 3. 4. 

In opposition to Scripture the efficaciousness of divine grace 
is denied a) by all particularists (Calvinists), who limit God’s effi¬ 
cacious desire to effect salvation in men to the elect; b) by all 
synergists, who teach that God works in man only the ability to 
believe, not faith itself, since the latter, they say, depends on man’s 
own decision or good conduct or his omission of malicious oppo¬ 
sition. However, according to Scripture, God bestows not only the 
power to believe, but also faith itself, Phil. 1,29. In opposition 
to Pelagianism and synergism, Scripture teaches that all who be¬ 
lieve in Christ believe solely by virtue of divine grace and not 
through their own power or effort (sola gratia), while over against 
Calvinism it affirms that those who remain in unbelief do so not 
because divine grace is inefficacious in their case, but because they 
maliciously resist the Holy Spirit. 



THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


251 


It is true, when we maintain universal and serious grace 
(gratia universalis, gratia seria et efficax), on the one hand, and 
the sola gratia, on the other, the question arises: “Why, then, 
are some saved and others not (cur alii, alii non f), though all men 
by nature are in the same guilt and corruption (in eadem culpa) f” 
The particularists (Calvinists) answer the question by denying the 
gratia universalis; the synergists, by denying the sola gratia. Both 
solutions are alike unscriptural, since Holy Writ most emphatically 
teaches both, gratia universalis and sola gratia. The true Lutheran 
Church does not attempt any solution of the question at all, but 
regards it as an unsolvable mystery, which human reason should 
not try to explore. The two truths regarding man’s salvation 
which Holy Scripture clearly reveals are: a) Those who are saved 
are saved by grace alone, without any merit on their part; b) those 
who are lost are lost through their own fault. Beyond these two 
revealed facts no Christian theologian dare go. (Cp. Formula of 
Concord, XI, 54—59.) 

Also with respect to the heathen we must maintain the gratia 
universalis because Holy Scripture includes all men in the gracious 
counsel of salvation. To deny the clear Scripture-teaching of 
universal grace because many heathen have never received the 
Gospel of salvation is an offense against the very divine grace 
which has enriched the world with the saving truth, Mark 16, 
15.16; Matt. 28,19. On the basis of Scripture we therefore be¬ 
lieve that God’s gracious will extends to the heathen also, though 
Actually thousands of them perish without the Gospel. Nor are 
we to assume that the heathen are saved without the divinely ap¬ 
pointed means of grace, Eph. 2, 12, since Holy Scripture teaches 
that the means of grace (the Word and the Sacraments) are ap¬ 
pointed for the salvation of all sinners, Mark 16,15.16; Matt. 28, 
19. 20. The opinion that the heathen may be converted after death 
is anti-Scriptural, Heb. 9, 27. The passage 1 Pet. 3,18ff. does not 
treat of salvation possible after death, but of the condemnation of 
those who during their life on earth refused to accept the saving 
Word of God. 

4. THE THEOLOGICAL TERMINOLOGY REGARDING THE 
DIVINE WILL OF GRACE. 

The unmerited favor and love of God which He cherishes 
toward all sinners in Christ Jesus is called also God’s good and 
gracious will. 1 Tim. 2, 4: ■deos ■deXet. On the basis of clear Scrip¬ 
ture-passages depicting God’s disposition toward mankind we speak 



252 


THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


of the divine will as being ordinate, conditional, antecedent and 
consequent, revealed and hidden, etc. Care must be taken that 
these terms are rightly understood and properly used. 

a. The divine will by which God earnestly desires the salva¬ 
tion of all men (voluntas gratiae) is not absolute (voluntas abso- 
luta), but ordinate (voluntas ordinata), inasmuch as it is based 
upon Christ’s vicarious obedience (satisfactio vicaria) and on God’s 
part embraces the conferring means (the Word and the Sacra¬ 
ments, media Sound) and on the part of man the receiving means 
(faith, medium Xgnuxov). In other words, God earnestly desires 
to save all men, but only for Christ’s sake and by faith, which He 
Himself works in man through the means of grace, Mark 16, 
15.16; Eom. 10,17. The divine will of grace may be called abso¬ 
lute only in the sense of its being entirely independent of human 
merit or worthiness; it is not absolute in the sense of being inde¬ 
pendent of the merit of Christ. 

b. The expression conditional will (voluntas conditionuta) is 
ambiguous and may be used both correctly and wrongly. It is 
used correctly when it is employed in the sense of ordinate will 
(voluntas ordinata), that is to say, when it expresses the para¬ 
mount truth that God desires to save sinners only through Christ, 
through the means of grace and faith kindled by these. It is used 
wrongly when it is employed in the synergistic sense, that man’s 
salvation depends, in part at least, on his cooperation in conver¬ 
sion or that man’s salvation is conditioned by his good conduct. 

If the objection is raised that Scripture itself conditions man’s 
salvation upon his obedience, we distinguish between God’s will 
as revealed in the Law and His will as revealed in the Gospel 
(Gesetzeswille, Evangeliumswille). The divine Law indeed de¬ 
mands perfect obedience of all men. Matt. 22, 37 —40, and to 
this demand is attached the promise: “This do, and thou shalt 
live,” Luke 10, 28. Such legal promises always presuppose a real 
condition; for if a person keeps the Law perfectly, he merits 
eternal life. 

However, because sinful man, corrupted by the Fall, cannot 
keep the divine Law perfectly, God in His infinite grace has given 
lost mankind the wonderful Gospel promise that every sinner should 
be saved by grace, through faith, without the deeds of the Law, 
Eom. 3, 28; Gal. 2,16. This is the gracious will of God revealed 
in the Gospel, which offers and conveys salvation to all men as 
a free gift, Eph. 2, 8. 9. Hence in all Scripture-passages which say 



THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


258 


that, if sinners believe, they shall live, John 6, 47; 20, 29; Acts 
13, 39; 16, 31, the protasis must not be regarded as a real condi¬ 
tion, but merely as showing the way or manner in which a sinner 
is saved. The statement of Christ “He that believeth on Me hath 
everlasting life,” John 6,47, does not mean: “Provided you fulfil 
the condition of believing, you have eternal life,” but: “You have 
eternal life by faith,” faith being the receiving means of salvation, 
not its meritorious cause, Eom. 3,28. Heerbrand: Fides non est 
conditio, neque ut conditio requiritur, . . . sed est modus quidam, 
oblatum beneficium et donatum per et propter Christum accipiens. 
Manus non conditio dicitur, sed medium et instrumentum, quo 
eleemosyna acdpitur. 

c. The distinction between voluntas antecedent (prima) and 
voluntas consequent (secunda) is Scriptural if it is understood in 
the sense of John 3,16—18. It is indeed the gracious will of God 
that all men should believe in Christ and be saved by faith in Him 
(voluntas antecedens). However, if sinners reject the grace of 
God and maliciously refuse to believe in Christ, then it is God’s 
will that they should be damned, Mark 16, 15. 16. Thus the 
voluntas antecedens applies to all men, while the voluntas conse- 
quens applies to all who perish through their unbelief. 

Nevertheless, as Gerhard rightly remarks, this division dis¬ 
tinguishes not the will by itself, which in God is one and undivided, 
just as also His essence is one, but its twofold relation. According 
to the first, God, as Gerhard comments, acts as a most gracious 
father (benignissimus pater); according to the second, as a most 
just judge (iustissimus iudex). The expressions antecedent will 
and consequent will have not always been used in the same sense, 
so that much confusion has resulted from their use. Hollaz thus 
uses the term voluntas consequent in an unscriptural sense when he 
says: “The consequent will is that by which God . . . elects those 
to eternal life who, He foresees, will use the ordinary means and 
will persevere in faith to the end of life.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 282.) 

The will of God is said to be antecedent and consequent 
a) neither with regard to time, as though the antecedent will pre¬ 
ceded the consequent in time, since God is free from any limitations 
of time; b) nor with regard to the divine will itself, as though 
there were two actually distinct wills in God; but c) according 
to our mode of conception, so that we may clearly know that God 
desires to save all believers and to damn all unbelievers. Hence 
the antecedent will of God is rightly defined as His will of mercy 



254 


THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD FALLEN MANKIND. 


(voluntas misericordiae) and His consequent will as His will of 
justice (voluntas iustitiae). Luther: “God does not deal with us 
according to His majesty, but puts on a human form and speaks 
to us throughout Scripture as man to man.” (St. L., I, 1442.) 

d. The distinction between the revealed will ( voluntas revelata, 
voluntas signi) and the hidden will (voluntas abscondita, voluntas 
beneplaciti) of God is used correctly if the former is referred to 
the divine will revealed in Scripture, 1 Cor. 2, 10. 16, and the 
second to the divine will which man neither knows nor can know, 
Rom. 11, 34. The revealed will of God includes both the Law, by 
which He demands of all men perfect obedience and threatens to 
damn all who transgress His commandments, and the Gospel, 
according to which God is willing to save all sinners by grace, 
through faith in Christ, without the deeds of the Law. This re¬ 
vealed will is fittingly called the “will of the sign” (voluntas signi) 
because God has manifested it to us by the sign of His Word. The 
hidden will (voluntas abscondita, voluntas beneplaciti) embraces 
the “unsearchable judgments” of God and “His ways which are 
past finding out,” Rom. 11, 33—35, as these are shown in the lives 
of both nations and individuals (Esau and Jacob, Jews and Gen¬ 
tiles, Rom. 9—11). 

These unsearchable judgments the Christian theologian must 
not try to explore; much less should he endeavor to explain them 
(Cur non omnes?) by denying either the gratia universalis (Cal¬ 
vinism: “God does not desire to save all men”) or the sola gratia 
(synergism, Arminianism, Semi-Pelaganiasm: “Man is not saved 
by grace alone”). The folly of both Calvinism and synergism con¬ 
sists in the futile endeavor to change the hidden will of God into 
a revealed will or to ascertain that which God has not revealed in 
His Word, an attempt which needs must be futile since the “reve¬ 
lations” thus supplied do not come from God, but from the igno¬ 
rant, blinded human mind. 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


255 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 

(Christologia.) 

Since the grace of God toward sinful mankind is not absolute, 
or arbitrary, but mediate (in Christ Jesus, Rom. 3, 24), the re¬ 
demption of our Savior constitutes its indispensable foundation, 
1 Cor. 3,11. 

The doctrine of Christ (Christology) therefore follows logically 
upon that of divine grace as the cardinal article of the Christian, 
faith, with which the Church stands or falls (articulus stantis et 
cadentis ecclesiae). While usually this expression is applied to the 
doctrine of justification, and rightly so, we must not forget that 
without the vicarious satisfaction of Christ there could be no doc¬ 
trine of justification by grace, through faith. Hence, as the re¬ 
deeming work of our Lord is the foundation of the doctrine of 
divine grace, so it is the foundation also of the doctrine of justi¬ 
fication. This becomes evident when we consider that faith justifies 
only as trust in Christ as the divine Redeemer, who died for our 
sins (Matt. 16, 13—17; 1 Tim. 2, 6: dvrUorgov vji'eq navxa>v) T 
and not as trust in Him as a new “Teacher of ethics,” or as a “per¬ 
fect Ideal,” or as a “great Revealer” of the “fatherhood of God,” 
and the like. In view of this fact the paramount importance of 
the doctrine of Christ is obvious. 

The doctrine of Christ is commonly treated under three heads: 
A. the Doctrine of the Person of Christ (de persona Christi sive 
de Christo deav&QU)7i(p); B. the Doctrine of the States of Christ 
(de stationibus exinanitionis et exaltationis); C. the Doctrine of 
the Work of Christ (de officio Christi). Under these three heads 
it is possible to group all truths which Holy Scripture reveals 
concerning our Lord and His work and to refute whatever errors 
have been voiced against them. 

The assumption that the Son of God would have become in¬ 
carnate even if man had not fallen into sin must be rejected as 
a useless, yes, dangerous speculation. It is useless, since human 
reason without divine revelation can never discover what God would 
have done had man not destroyed his happiness by sinning. It is 
dangerous, not only because it involves a basic element of pan¬ 
theism, but also because it ignores the only purpose of Christ’s 
incarnation which Scripture mentions, namely, the salvation of lost 
and condemned mankind, Matt. 18,11; 1 Tim. 1,15; Gal. 4, 5. 
Augustine: Si homo non periisset, Filius Hominis non venisset. 



256 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


A. The Doctrine of the Person of Christ. 

(De Persona Christ!.) 

1. INTRODUCTION. 

Holy Scripture expressly calls Christ true God and ascribes 
to Him all the divine attributes; but it also calls Christ true man 
and ascribes to Him all the attributes common to men. Christ 
is therefore true God and true man, or the God-man (dedv&gamog 

For this reason we must reject as unscriptural every doctrine 
which denies or limits a) the true deity of Christ (Monarchianism, 
Unitarianism), b) His true humanity (Docetae, Gnostics, Ana¬ 
baptists), and c) the personal union of the two natures in the one 
Person (unio personalis) together with the resultant doctrines of 
the communion of the two natures (communio naturarum) and the 
communication of attributes (communicatio idiomatum). The 
controversies of the Lutherans in defense of the last two doctrines 
were directed not only against the Calvinists, but also against the 
papists. 

2. THE TRUE DEITY OF CHRIST. 

That Christ is true God, coeternal and consubstantial with 
the Father, is incontrovertibly attested in Holy Scripture. The 
proofs for the doctrine may be grouped as follows. Scripture as¬ 
cribes to Christ — 

a) The name God (deog, John 1,1) and Son of God (vldg tov 
&eov, Matt. 16,16), and these not in an improper sense, in which 
they are applied also to creatures (foot Xeyofievoi, dei nuncupativi, 
1 Cor. 8, 5; John 10,35), but in their proper, or metaphysical, 
sense, so that Christ is said to possess not only divine functions, 
but also the one divine essence. John 10,30: “I and the Father 
are one (eV)”; John 1,14: “The glory as of the Only-begotten of 
the Father” (<5o£av <bg fiovoyevovg naga. natgog). Even the nomen 
Dei essentiale et incommunicabile Jehovah (nirv) is given to Christ, 
Ps. 97,1. 7; cp. with Heb. 1, 6; 

b) The divine attributes: eternity, John 8,58; 17,5; 1,1; 
omniscience, John 21,17; omnipotence, John 10,28—30; 

c) The divine works: creation and preservation, Col. 1, 
16.17; John 5,17—19; the resurrection of the dead, John 5,21. 
28. 29; miracles performed by His own power, John 2,11; 

d) Divine adoration and worship, John 20,28; 5,23; Phil. 
2, 9 ff. Thus in every way Scripture describes Christ as equal to 
God in divine majesty, glory, and honor, Phil. 2, 6. 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


257 


If modem Subordinationists object that Christ is called God 
only in the predicate, but never in the subject, we reply a) that 
this is not true (cp. Heb. 1,8; John 20, 28) and b) that, if Christ 
is called God in the predicate, this asserts His deity even more 
emphatically than if He were called God in the subject, since it is 
the very function of the predicate to describe the subject according 
to its true essence, Rom. 9, 5. To this we may add that the term 
God , when used in its proper sense, is never a generic term, but 
always a proper noun, since it always designates the divine Essence 
which exists but as one (una numero essentia divina). 

Again, in reply to the objection that Christ is indeed essentially 
God, yet only in a secondary sense of the term (Subordinationists), 
we say that this anti-Scriptural view is based upon a tritheistic or 
polytheistic conception of God, as if the Holy Trinity consisted 
of one supreme God and two lesser deities. While it is true that 
Christ described the Father as greater than Himself, John 14, 28, 
according to His human nature, in the state of humiliation. Scrip¬ 
ture, on the other hand, ascribes to Him the entire divine essence 
with all its perfections, Col. 2, 3. 9, proving that He is God in the 
same sense as the Father. 

The charge that Christ in that case could not have suffered 
alone, since the numerically one essence would have drawn into His 
suffering also the Father (Patripassianism), can be answered thus: 
We accept the two doctrines (the unity of the divine essence and 
the exclusion of the Father from Christ’s suffering and death) 
on the authority of Scripture as a part of the great mystery of 
Christ’s miraculous incarnation (1 Tim. 3, 16: o^oXoyovfxevoig 
fjUy a fivoxriQiov). 

Every denial of Christ’s true and essential deity is based, not 
upon lack of adequate Scripture proof, but upon the rationalistic 
tendency of the carnal heart, to which the Gospel of Christ is both 
foolishness and a stumbling-block, 1 Cor. 1, 23; 2,14. If Christ is 
not true God, but only a human prophet. Matt. 16,13 ff., then the 
entire Gospel of Christ’s vicarious redemption is annulled and the 
Pelagianistic doctrine of work-righteousness must stand; for in 
that case fallen man has no divine Savior, 1 Cor. 15, 3. 4.17 f., and 
therefore is obliged to earn salvation by good works. Yet in this 
very error the proud, self-righteous mind of unregenerate man 
glories. (Cp. Luther, St. L., IX, 237ff. 376ff.; XYI, 1688ff.; 
VII, 1263 ff.) 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 


17 



258 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


3. THE TRUE HUMANITY OF CHRIST. 

The reason why a detailed proof of Christ’s true humanity has 
become necessary is that errorists have denied Christ’s true human 
nature either a) altogether ( Docetae: Christ’s body was a phan¬ 
tom) or b) in part, by denying His human soul (Arians: The 
Xoyog took the place of His human soul), or His human spirit 
(Apollinaris: The koyog took the place of the vov ?), or His human 
will (Monothelitism), or His true human birth (Gnostics, Valen¬ 
tinus: The body of Christ was of celestial origin). Christ with¬ 
out a human nature could be the Savior of the world as little as 
a Christ without a divine nature. 1 John 1, 7: “The blood of 
Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all sin.” 

Accordingly Scripture is as emphatic in predicating of Christ 
true humanity as it is in ascribing to Him true deity. It ascribes 
to Him a) human names, 1 Tim. 2, 5; John 8, 40; b) human 
flesh and blood consubstantial with man’s, Heb. 2,14; c) human 
descent, Rom. 9, 5; Matt. 1, Iff.; Luke 3, 23 ff.; Gen. 22, 18, 
cp. with Gal. 3,16; d) a really human, though miraculous, con¬ 
ception in the womb of Mary, Luke 1, 42; e) the constituent parts 
of a human being, John 2,21; Luke 24,39; Matt. 26, 38; Luke 
23,46; 22,42; f) human emotions, Mark 3, 5; 14,34; g) human 
physical wants. Matt. 4, 2; John 19,28; Luke 8,23; h) human 
suffering and death, Matt. 27, 46; John 19, 30. 

The kdyog therefore did not bring down His body from heaven, 
but assumed human nature in the body of Mary, so that He was 
true man, Luke 1, 35. All who deny the true humanity of Christ 
do so not because the evidence of Scripture is inadequate, but 
because they allow themselves to be misled by rationalistic (“The 
finite is not capable of the infinite”) or Pelagianistic considera¬ 
tions (“It was not necessary for the Son of God to become tLs 
Substitute and Redeemer of man”). 

Against Pelagianism in every form we hold on the basis of 
Scripture that the divine Redeemer had to be true man in order 
that He might perform the stupendous work of redemption, Is. 53, 
7—11, fulfil the divine Law in man’s place, Gal. 4, 4. 5, and atone 
for his sin, Is. 53, 1—6. Hence the denial of Christ’s true 
humanity is tantamount to the denial of His vicarious atonement, 
Heb. 2,14; John 1,14. 

Christ according to His divine nature is 6/ioovoiog, consub- 
siantialis, with the Father; according to His human nature He is

6fioovaioi, consubstantialis, with man, yet not secundum numerum, 
bnt secundum speciem. 

The expression Son of Man which our Savior usually employed 
when He spoke of Himself, does not describe Christ as the “Ideal 
Man,” but as the unique Descendant of man, Gen. 3,15; 26,4; 
28,14; 2 Sam. 7,12, in whom the Son of God became incarnate. 
Is. 7, 14; 9, 6. That is Christ’s own explanation of the name 
which He adopted as His usual designation, as this appears from 
Matt. 16, 13—17 (cp. v. 16: “the Christ, the Son of the living 
God”). Hence the “Son of Man” is the Ood~man, foretold in the 
Old Testament, Dan. 7,13.14, who came to destroy the works of 
the devil, 1 John 3, 8, and who therefore had to be true God, Matt. 
9, 2. 4. 6; 12, 8; 26, 63. 64; 25, 31ff., and at the same time true 
man. Matt. 8, 20; 11,19; 17,12.22.23; 20,18.19. 

Though Christ is true man, consubstantial with all other men, 
yet His human nature is marked by certain peculiarities (proprie- 
tates individuates) that are not found in other human beings. 
Among these peculiarities we note: — 

Christ’s supernatural conception (extraordinaria conceptio). 
Christ was not the son of Joseph and Mary (against the Ebionites, 
Modernists), but was conceived by the Holy Ghost in the womb 
of Mary, the virgin. Matt. 1, 18; Luke 1, 35 (conceptio miracu- 
losa). The cau&a efficiens of the Son of Man was the Holy Ghost; 
the materia ex qua. His virgin mother, Matt. 1,20. Cp. the Apos¬ 
tolic Creed: Conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria 
virgine. If the objection is raised that an inconceivable miracle 
such as this would violate the “immutable laws of nature,” Scrip¬ 
ture itself supplies an adequate answer — Luke 1, 34—37. Christ’s 
supernatural conception was a miracle of God’s omnipotence and 
grace, which we should gratefully acknowledge, Luke 1, 38. 

(P 

Christ's perfect sinlessness (ivapaprrjola). While all other 
men are conceived and born in sin, Ps. 51, 5; John 3, 6; 5,12—20, 
the Son of Man was without sin, Is. 53, 9; John 8,46; Luke 1,35; 
2 Cor. 5, 21; 1 Pet. 1,19; 2, 22, and had to be without sin to 
be our Savior, Heb. 7, 26. 27; 1 Pet. 1, 19. Though Scripture 
ascribes sin to Christ, it expressly explains that this wts imputed 
sin, or our sin charged to Christ, peccatum imputatum, Is. 53,6; 
2 Cor. 5,21. 

However, Scripture not only establishes the fact and necessity 
of Christ’s sinlessness, but also explains how it was that He was 
conceived and born sinless. The cause was not a) that a holy seed 



260 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


(massa sancta) was preserved and propagated in Israel until the 
Savior was born (scholastic theologians), or b) that by way of 
evolution Mary developed into a holy person (modern rationalistic 
theologians, Olshausen), or c) the immaculate conception of Mary 
(immaculata conceptio, proclaimed by Pope Pius IX, December 8, 
1854), but the astounding fact that Mary became the mother of 
Christ according to His human nature through the Holy Ghost, 
Matt. 1,18: lx nvtvpiaxoQ dytov). 

In consequence of His supernatural conception Christ was free 
from both original sin (peccatum originate) and actual sin (pecca- 
tum actuate). This truth we derive from all passages that describe 
Christ’s absolute sinlessness, Heb. 7, 26. 27; 1 John 3, 5, as well as 
from those which affirm that He became man not after the order 
of nature (Luther: non ex came contaminata et horribiliter pot- 
luta), but through the Holy Ghost, Matt. 1,18; Luke 1, 35. Since 
Christ did not descend from sinful seed, He was free from heredi¬ 
tary corruption (corruptio hereditaria) and from hereditary guilt 
(cutpa hereditaria; reatus peccati Adamitici), which is imputed 
to all men begotten of sinful flesh, John 3, 6; Rom. 5,16.19. 

Nevertheless, though Christ’s human nature was free from sin, 
it was a true human nature, because sin does not belong to the 
essence of man (sin being an accidens ). Hence Christ was indeed 
a true man, but one who, so far as His person was concerned, was 
not under the Law, but above the Law, Matt. 12,8. 

Since Christ’s human nature was received into the Aoyoff, 
we must deny that there was in Him even the possibility of sin¬ 
ning, John 8, 46; 1 Pet. 1, 19; the holy Savior could not sin 
(Christus sacerdos impeccabilis). In spite of this fact we must 
not regard the temptation of Christ as mere sham, but as a real 
temptation and suffering, which He endured for our salvation, 
Matt. 4, Iff.; Heb. 2,18; 4,15. 

The consequences of Christ’s sinlessness were — 

a) His immortality (d&avaota); for according to Scripture, 
death is the wages of sin, Gen. 2,17; 3,17—19; Rom. 5,12; 6, 23. 
Christ died of His own will and power as the Savior of men (non 
aliqua necessitate, sed libera voluntate), John 10,18; 1 Cor. 15, 3. 
The death of the Sinless One, who Himself was immortal, was the 
ransom (Matt. 20, 28; 1 Tim. 2, 6) by which He purchased life 
for sinful mankind ( Xvxqov , dvxtkvxQov). Christus mortuus est 
propter peccatum imputatum. 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


261 


b) Greater natural gifts (singularis excellentia), such as wis¬ 
dom, Luke 2, 52, because there were no disturbing and perverting 
effects of sin in His body. (Cp. Adam’s natural gifts before the 
Fall, Gen. 2, 19. 20. 23.) 

Much has been said concerning Christ’s external appearance; 
but from Ps. 46 ,2 we must not infer extraordinary physical beauty 
nor from Is. 53 ,2 extraordinary deformity, since the one passage 
describes Christ in His beauty as Savior (Erloeserschoenheit) and 
the other in His deep humiliation (Leidensgestalt). The evan¬ 
gelists indeed picture the grace of Christ’s words, Luke 4, 22, but 
never any beauty of person. However, let us bear in mind that 
Christ in His whole state of humiliation suffered the consequences 
of our sins, so that He always appeared in the form of a servant 
( f*OQ<pt) dovlav) and in the likeness of men (lv dpoubpaxt dvdgd)- 
mov), Phil. 2, 7; Bom. 8, 3. His bodily appearance therefore was 
not like that of man before the Fall, but rather like that of fallen 
and sinful man (iv dpoubpaxi oagxds Afiagrlae). Bimilitudo . . . 
propter assumptas infirmitates peccatrix visa est. 

With respect to the human infirmities which Jesus suffered. 
Scripture shows that He indeed endured the common, or general, 
infirmities of men (infirmitates communes), such as hunger, thirst, 
weariness, sorrow, etc., but not the personal infirmities (infirmi¬ 
tates personales), such as personal illness, blindness, or any other 
personal defect; for of these not one instance is recorded. 

c) The impersonality of Christ's human nature (drvnooxaota, 
iwjiooxaola). Among the peculiarities of Christ’s human nature 
we note also its want of personality, that is to say, Christ’s human 
nature did not form a distinct person (carentia propriae subsis¬ 
tence). Christ did not consist of two persons, one divine and 
the other human, but in Him the divine and the human nature 
were united into one undivided and indivisible person, 1 Tim. 2, 5. 
Humana Christi natura non habet propriam subsistentiam, per- 
sonalitatem, vndoxaotv. 

This fact follows from the peculiar mode of the incarnation 
(modus incamationis). For when the Son of God became in¬ 
carnate, He did not assume a human person, but only human 
nature; in other words, the human nature was received into the 
person of the loyoe. Gal. 4,4. 6; John 1,14; Heb. 2, 14. Accord¬ 
ingly we predicate of Christ’s human nature negatively dwnooxaola, 
or the Scriptural truth that it possesses no personality of its own; 
positively we predicate of Christ’s human nature Iwnooxaoia, 



262 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


or the Scriptural truth that the human nature of Christ subsists 
in the JL6yos (subsistentia humanae naturae in divina natura 
rov X6yov). 

If the objection is raised against this doctrine that the term 
Son of Man is just as much a designation of a person as is the 
term Son of God and that therefore the human nature of Christ 
must be regarded as a distinct person, we reply that this conclusion 
does not hold, since these terms do not designate two different 
persons, but only one and the same person, who at the same time 
is both God and man, Matt. 16,13—17. In the person of Christ 
there are &U .0 xal fiXXo, but not dXXog xal SXXog. Of all other 
men the axiom holds: Quot humanae naturae, tot personae 
humanae; but this axiom is not applicable to Christ, because the 
Logos assumed human nature into His divine person, Col. 2, 9. 

Modern rationalistic theology, which has surrendered the 
Scriptural doctrine of the impersonality of Christ’s human nature, 
must consequently surrender also the doctrine of the incarnation, 
since this consisted essentially in the act that the Son of God re¬ 
ceived into His divine person human nature, so that from the 
very moment when His human nature was created (productio) it 
was also united (unitio) with the X6yog, Luke 1, 43. °Aua oag f, 
&fia X6yov oapf. 

As modem rationalistic theology denies the incarnation, so it 
affirms that the two natures in Christ gradually grew into each 
other, or coalesced, and that in this way the union (unitio) of the 
two natures was effected. However, Scripture does not teach a uni- 
tion of the two natures in Christ by coalescence, but a unition by 
incarnation, John 1,14. If modern theology objects to this doc¬ 
trine on the ground that the unition of the Son of God with an 
embryo cannot be regarded as worthy of God, we answer that this 
“unworthy conception of God” is clearly stated in Scripture, 
Luke 1, 35. Again, if it objects that an intimate union such as the 
incarnation presupposes is unthinkable, we reply that Scripture 
itself describes the incarnation as a “mystery of godliness,” which 
is “without controversy great,” 1 Tim. 3,16. 

In order to emphasize the truth that the Son of God indeed 
assumed human nature, but not a human person, our dogmaticians 
say: Deus assumpsit naturam humanam, or humanitatem; but 
not: Deus assumpsit hominem. In view of the fact that modern 
rationalistic theology has changed the doctrine of the two natures 
. (Zweinaturenlehre) into a doctrine of two persons, this distinction 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


203 


is very important. — The more extreme type of modern theology 
regards Christ as a mere man, in whom God revealed Himself in 
a higher degree than in an ordinary man (Ritschl; Modernism); 
in other words, the difference between Christ and all other men is 
only one of degree, not of kind. 

4. THE PERSONAL UNION. 

(De Unione Personal!.) 

God is at all times essentially and actively present in all crea¬ 
tures, Jer. 23, 23. 24; Eph. 4, 10; and to this union with the 
Triune God all created things owe their subsistence, Acts 17,28; 
Col. 1,16—18. This union has been fitly called the general union 
(unio generalis) because it embraces all existing things, animate 
and inanimate, rational and irrational, in the entire realm of 
nature. In addition to this union, Scripture teaches also a special 
union (unio specialis, unio spiritualis), namely, the most gracious 
union of the Triune God with the believers (unio mystica), by 
which the communion of saints is the living, spiritual temple of 
God, John 14, 23; 1 Cor. 3,16 f.; 6,17—19; Eph. 1, 22. 23. In the 
third place. Holy Scripture teaches a sacramental union (unio 
sacramentaJis), by which the true body and blood of Christ are 
really and substantially present in the Lord’s Supper and are dis¬ 
tributed and received in, with, and under the bread and wine. 

From these unions we distinguish the personal union (unio 
personalis), by which the divine and the human nature of Christ 
are most intimately united in the one person of the God-man 
(hypostatic union, unio hypostatica). Hollaz defines the personal 
union thus: “The personal union is the conjunction of the two 
natures, divine and human, subsisting in the one hypostasis 
( vjidozaoig, persona) of the Son of God, producing a mutual and 
indissoluble communion of both natures.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 296.) 
This personal union was effected when in His incarnation the Aoyog 
so assumed human nature into His divine person (actus unitionis) 
that in the incarnate Christ (koyog evaagxog) God and man are 
forever one undivided and indivisible person ( status unionis, 
evaioig vnooxaxixrj). This is “the mystery of godliness,” of which 
St. Paul testifies that it is “confessedly great,” 6/j.oXoyov/xeyaig 
joeya, 1 Tim. 3,16, or the miracle of all ages. 

The personal union is proved incontrovertibly by the personal 
propositions (propositions personales), that is, by clear Scripture- 
passages in which with reference to the incarnate Christ it is said 



264 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


that God is man and man is God. Matt. 16,13—17: The Son of 
Man is the Son of the living God; Luke 1, 31. 32: The Son of 
Mary is the Son of the Highest; Jer. 23, 5. 6: The Branch of 
David is the Lord, njn\ our Righteousness; Rom. 9,6: The Christ 
who comes of the fathers is God, blessed forever; John 1,14: The 
Word was made flesh; Rom. 1, 3. 4: He who was made of the seed 
of David is God’s Son, our Lord; etc. These personal propositions 
can be explained only on the ground that the divine and the human 
nature are so intimately and permanently united in the person of 
Christ that He is at the same time true God and true man. 

The personal, or hypostatic, union of the two natures in Christ 
is unique; that is to say, in the entire realms of both nature and 
grace there is no other union of God and man like that which 
exists in Christ. It may be somewhat illustrated (the union of 
soul and body in man; iron glowing with fire); but these unions 
are only similar to, not like, the personal union. Thus, while we 
can say that in Christ, God is man and man is God, we cannot 
say that in man the soul is body or that in iron glowing with fire 
the iron is fire. 

For this reason the personal propositions have been called 
unusual or singular (propositiones inusitatae), or propositions for 
which there is no analog. Yet, while the personal propositions are 
inusitatae (unique), they are real and not merely verbal (ver - 
bales); proper (propriae), not metaphorical, figurative, or trop¬ 
ical (impropriae et tropicae). That is to say, in Christ the two 
natures are truly united, just as the personal propositions affirm, 
so that Christ is God-man (^edv^gtonog) in the fullest sense of 
the term (persona ovvderos, persona composita). 

While on the basis of Scripture the Christian Church teaches 
the personal union of the two natures in Christ, it emphatically 
rejects a) the error of Eutyches (monophysitism), who taught that 
the union was effected by a mingling of the two natures into each 
other or by confusion or a conversion of the one nature into the 
other (unio per mixtionem et conversionem), so that by such 
mingling, or conversion, a third object (tertium quiddam) came 
into being; b) the error of Nestorius, who, though affirming 
a connection ( ovrd<peia ) of the two natures, nevertheless regarded 
them as separate ( Formula of Concord: “two boards glued to¬ 
gether”), thus denying the personal union and in particular the 
communion of the natures and the communication of attributes 
(Mary is not t?eotoxof). 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


265 


Against these two errors the Council of Chalcedon (451) 
declared: “We confess one and the same Jesus Christ, the Son 
and Lord only-begotten, in two natures (h dvo (pvasoiv ) without 
mixture (dovyxvuoe), without change (digejircof), [against Euty- 
ches], without division (idiaigiuof), without separation (&x<oQt- 
ortoe), [against Nestorius].” The error of Nestorius was later 
championed by Zwingli (AXXouoats), who taught: Wherever Scrip¬ 
ture says that Christ has suffered, you must read: The human 
nature only has suffered. 

In refutation of the Eutychian as well as the Zwinglian 
(Nestorian) error our dogmaticians say: “The two natures in 
Christ are united a) inconvertibly (the divine nature was not 
changed into flesh; against Eutyches), b) unconfusedly (the two 
natures were not mingled into a third object; against Eutyches), 
c) inseparably and uninterruptedly (against Nestorius); that is to 
say, the two natures in Christ are never separated by any intervals 
either of time or place. The union was neither dissolved in death 
(time), nor is the Xoyoe after the incarnation anywhere present 
outside the flesh (place). After the incarnation the Son of God is 
always and everywhere FUius Dei incarnatus. Neque caro extra 
X6yov, neque X6yos extra camem. John 1, 14; Col. 2, 9; Eom. 
5, 10; etc. 

In opposition to all errorists, ancient and modern, the Chris¬ 
tian Church confesses that the personal union is — 

a. Not unio nominalis, a nominal union, as though the Son 
of Man were God only in name (Deus nuncupative). Christ is 
true and very God, John 10, 30, so that the personal union is real 
(unio realis). While all Unitarians are willing to call Christ God 
(Kitschl: “For us Christ has the value of God; hence, while the 
ascription of deity to Christ is not a real judgment [SeinsurteiV], 
it is a value judgment [Werturteiiy’; Harnack: “Christ may be 
called the Son of God because He proclaimed to men the father¬ 
hood of God”), they strenuously deny that He is God de facto. 

b. Not unio naturalis, a natural union, like that of soul and 
body, which have been created for each other. The personal union 
is not a natural union, since it intimately and inseparably unites 
the Creator and the creature, God and man, into one person (ens 
increatum et creatum). 

This union is therefore incomprehensible to human reason, 
1 Tim. 3, 16. To render it somewhat intelligible to the human 
mind, some scholastic theologians said that the Son of God was 



266 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


joined to human nature through the means of the soul (mediants 
anima), since only in this way two immaterial beings (God and 
soul are both spirits) can be joined. The soul, however, is just 
as much a creature as the body, so that the great problem how Ood 
could be united with a creature into one person is hereby not solved. 
But this view is also unscriptural; for while Christ in death gave 
up His spirit, Matt. 27, 60; Mark 15, 37; John 19, 30, so that the 
natural union (unto naturalis) of soul and body ceased, the per¬ 
sonal union did not cease (Bom. 5, 10: Christ’s death was the 
death of the Son of God). For this reason the personal union can¬ 
not be a natural union, or a union mediante anima. 

c. Not unio accidentalis, an accidental union, as when two 
boards are glued together or a human body is clothed in a garment. 
An accidental union does not join two things into one in such 
a manner as the personal union unites the two natures into one 
person. Of two things accidentally joined together one may be 
injured and the other not (the garment may be torn, while the body 
remains unharmed), whereas the human nature in Christ was so 
joined to the divine that, when the human nature suffered, shed 
blood, and died, the Son of Ood suffered, shed His blood, and died, 
1 John 1,1.7; 1 Cor. 2,8; Acts 20,28. 

d. Not unio sustentativa (nuda nagovoia site nagdaraotg), 
or a sustaining union by mere divine presence, by which God is 
present in, and sustains, all creatures, Col. 1,17; Acts 17, 28. It is 
true, the divine nature sustained the human in Christ’s great suf¬ 
fering, Matt. 26, 42; yet the essence of the personal union does not 
consist in that sustaining act, but rather in the most intimate con¬ 
junction of the two natures in the one person of Christ. Creatures 
are never assumed into the Godhead in spite of the sustaining 
presence of God; but through the personal union the human nature 
of Christ was received into the person of the Son of God. 

e. Not unio habitualis (relativa, oxerixrf), a relative union, 
which indeed places two things into a certain relation with each 
other, but still leaves them separate essentially. Thus two friends 
are joined together by the union of mutual love; yet they remain 
two distinct individuals, separated even by space. But the personal 
union of the two natures in Christ was not relative (Theodore 
of Mopsuestia, f ca. 428), since the fulness of the Godhead dwells 
in Christ bodily , Col. 2, 9. The two natures in Christ are in¬ 
separably joined and by their most intimate and permanent union 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


267 


constitute the one indivisible Christ. While the union effected 
through friendship may cease, the personal union never ceases. 

f. Not unio essentialis sive commixtiva, an essential or com¬ 
mingling union, by which through the personal union the two 
natures coalesced into one nature or essence (Eutychianism). 

Since the charge was raised against the Lutherans that they, 
too, mixed the two natures into each other (conversio aut confusio 
aut exaequatio), the Formula of Concord expressly refuted this 
erroneous accusation, saying (Thor. Decl., VIII, 62f.): “In no 
way is conversion, confusion, or equalization of the natures in 
Christ or of their essential properties to be maintained or admitted. 
Accordingly we have never understood the words realis communi- 
catio, or communicated reaMter, that is, the impartation or com¬ 
munion which occurs in deed and truth, of any physica communi- 
catio vel essentialis transfusio, physical communication or essential 
transfusion, that is, of an essential, natural communion or effusion, 
by which the natures would be commingled in their essence, and 
their essential properties; . . . but we have only opposed them to 
verbalis communicatio (verbal communication).” 

g. Not unio per adoptionem, a union by adoption (Adop- 
tionism; Felix of Urgel, Elipandus of Toledo, in the 8th century; 
condemned by various synods 792—799, mainly at the instigation 
of Alcuin, f 804), by which Christ according to His human nature 
has been said to be God’s adopted Son (Filius Dei adoptivus). 
Adoptionism is a form of Nestorianism and presupposes two per¬ 
sons in Christ, one divine and the other human, of whom the latter 
was divinely adopted. In opposition to this error our Lutheran 
dogmaticians teach that Christ according to His human nature is 
the “born Son of God,” or the Son of God by His very birth (Filius 
Dei natus vel ab ipsa nativitate). The incarnation was not an 
adoption of a human person by God, but the assumption of human 
nature into the person of the koyog. 

Eutychianism and Nestorianism (Zwinglianism) are attempts 
to render the mystery of the incarnation intelligible to human 
reason, either by mingling or by separating the two natures. But 
both errors, which equally annul the personal union, in the final 
analysis deny the vicarious atonement of Christ (satisfactio 
vicaria), since the redemption of lost and sinful mankind could be 
effected only by the God-man. Eutychianism and Nestorianism 
both lead to Unitarianism (Modernism), or to the error that Christ 
was a mere man. 



268 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


The same may be said of the error of kenoticism, or the doc¬ 
trine that the Son of God in His incarnation emptied Himself 
(Ixevoooev, Phil. 2, 7) of His divine attributes of omnipotence, 
omnipresence, and omniscience (Thomasius, Delitzsch, Kahnis, 
Luthardt, etc.) or of His divine consciousness and personality 
(Gess, Hofmann, Frank). Through this “self-limitation” of the 
Son of God the mystery of the incarnation is indeed explained, 
but at the tremendous cost of denying Christ’s true deity. For if 
God has laid aside His divine attributes, He has laid aside His 
divine essence and has thus become a mutable being, who cannot 
be true God. 

As we reject kenoticism, so we must reject also the error of 
autohypostasism (avzovnoozazog), according to which the Son of 
Man constituted a separate person (Idtoovazazos), who either grad¬ 
ually coalesced with the divine person of the X6yog (Dorner) or 
remained separate altogether (Seeberg, Kirn, etc.). If that were 
true, Christ would be a mere man, in whom God merely worked in 
an extraordinary measure. If autohypostasism is adopted, the 
personal union, or the doctrine of Christ’s two natures, is sur¬ 
rendered, and extreme Modernism, with its absolute denial of 
Christ’s deity, is the only alternative. 

The mystery of the incarnation can never be explained by 
reason; it must either be believed in toto or rejected in toto. At 
this point, as before all mysteries of divine revelation, the theo¬ 
logian stands at the crossroads, and he must choose either the way 
of Christian faith or that of pagan unbelief. 

5. THE COMMUNION OF NATURES. 

(De Communione Naturarum.) 

A special discussion of the communion of natures (communio 
naturarum) has become necessary because both the Reformed and 
the papists indeed admit a union of the human nature of Christ 
with the person (yndozaaig) of the l6yog, but deny the real and 
direct communion of the natures with each other. While they 
concede the unio personalis, they reject the communio naturarum. 
Their opposition to the latter doctrine, which Scripture teaches 
with great clearness, is based upon the rationalistic axiom: “The 
finite is not capable of the infinite.” Finitum non est capax 
infiniti. The Reformed theologian Danaeus writes: “Nothing 
whatever that is proper and essential to the Deity can in any way 
be communicated to a created thing, such as is the human nature 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


269 


assumed by Christ.” (Pieper, Christl. Dogmatik, II, 135 ff.) 
Insistence on this principle by Calvinistic theologians is so 
emphatic that they charge the Lutherans, who on the basis of 
Scripture affirm the communio naturarum, with Eutychianism, or 
the mingling of the two natures. 

However, in denying the communio naturarum, the Reformed 
and the papists contradict and deny their own doctrine regarding 
the personal union. If the finite is incapable of the infinite, then 
indeed the union of human nature with the person of the Aoyo? 
(personal union) is impossible, since the person of the Son of God 
is as infinite as is His divine nature. In other words, then there 
can be no personal union. Then, too, the entire incarnation of 
the Son of God must be denied as impossible, since this consists 
essentially in the union of God with man. Hence consistency on 
the part of the Reformed and papists would demand the rejection 
of the entire mystery of godliness that “God was manifest in the 
flesh,” 1 Tim. 3,16. The doctrine of the communion of natures 
follows directly from that of the personal union, so that they either 
stand or fall together. 

But the Reformed and papistical error is directed also against 
Holy Scripture. The communion of the two natures of Christ is 
proved a) from general passages, such as John 1, 14; Heb. 2, 
14. 15, etc., which clearly show that the Son of God so joined 
Himself to the flesh (oapf) that His divine nature has true com¬ 
munion with the human nature; b) from special passages, such as 
Col. 2, 3. 9: “In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead 
bodily” (oa)/uaTixd)i). From these passages we learn in particular: 

a) That the divine nature entered into a true and real union 
with the human nature, since the fulness of the Godhead dwells 
in Christ bodily. On the basis of this and other passages, Hollaz 
writes: “The communion of natures in the person of Christ is the 
mutual participation of the divine and human natures of Christ, 
through which the divine nature of the Aoyog, having become par¬ 
ticipant of the human nature, pervades, perfects, inhabits, and 
appropriates this to itself; but the human nature, having become 
participant of the divine nature, is pervaded, perfected, and in¬ 
habited by it” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 316ff.); 

b) That in Christ there is not mere contiguity ( ovvacpna ) 
of the two natures, but a most profound and intimate interpene¬ 
tration (neQixcoQrjois), since the divine nature permeates the human 
nature, just as the soul permeates the body; 



270 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


c) That in spite of this most intimate interpenetration there 
is no mingling, mixture, or change of the two natures, because the 
fulness of the Godhead dwells in the human nature. As the per¬ 
sons of the Trinity permeate each other without mixture, or as 
the soul dwells in the body without mingling, so the Xoyog pervades 
the flesh in such a manner that neither of the natures is mingled 
or mixed with the other (unio dovyxviog, djaixiog, urgenrog); 

d) That the divine nature must not be conceived as extending 
beyond the human, since the fulness of the Godhead dwells in the 
body. In other words, just as the soul is in the living body, but 
never beyond it, so the Xoyog is in the flesh so as never to be beyond 
or outside it (neque caro extra Xoyov, neque Xoyog extra camera); 

e) That the communion of the two natures in Christ is in¬ 
separable (dxtbgiorog), since they are united permanently ( ddia - 
oitmoc), or so that they are always mutually present to each other. 
The doctrine of the communion of natures as taught by the Lu¬ 
theran theologians is therefore truly Scriptural. 

Quenstedt presents the doctrine as follows: “The communion 
of natures is that most intimate participation ( xoivcovia ) and com¬ 
bination ( ovvdvaotg ) of the divine nature of the Xoyog and the 
assumed human nature by which the Xoyog, through a most intimate 
and profound interpenetration {negixobgrjotg), so permeates, in¬ 
habits, and appropriates to Himself the human nature personally 
united with Him that from both, mutually intercommunicating, 
there arises the one incommunicable subject, namely, one person.” 
( Doctr. Theol.j p. 310.) The opposing Zwinglian doctrine (Nes- 
torianism) Quenstedt describes as follows: “[We condemn] the 
antithesis of the Calvinists, some of whom teach that it is only 
the person of the Xoyog and not at the same time His divine nature 
that has been united with human nature. . . . Thus they invent 
a double union, mediate and immediate, saying that the natures 
are united, not immediately, but through the medium of the person 
of the Xoyog.” {Doctr. Theol., p. 316.) 

The Reformed theologians object to the communion of natures 
on the ground that in that case the human nature of Christ must 
be conceived of as being “very large,” since otherwise it could not 
be everywhere present with the divine nature (local extension); 
indeed, that in that case it could not be regarded as a true human 
nature at all, since properties are ascribed to it of which human 
nature is incapable. In answer to this we say that the human 
nature of Christ was not physically enlarged through the incarna- 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


271 


tion, but is omnipresent with the divine nature. Matt. 28,20, not 
by local extension , but by an illocal mode of presence , John 20, 
19—26; Luke 24, 31, which it possesses besides its ordinary local 
mode, John 4, 3. 4, by virtue of the personal union. 

If the Reformed theologians furthermore ask how this is pos¬ 
sible without the destruction of the human nature, we answer 
that Holy Scripture teaches this to be a fact (John 1,14; Matt. 
28, 18—20), though a great mystery (1 Tim. 3, 16), and that 
therefore this doctrine must not be denied, but believed. Again, 
if they affirm that the human nature of Christ received extraor¬ 
dinary finite gifts (dona finita extraordinaria), but not truly 
divine gifts (dona divina), we remind them of the Scripture- 
passages which directly ascribe divine gifts to the human nature, 
1 John 1, 7; Matt. 9, 6; John 5, 27; Matt. 28,18. 20. While the 
human nature performs actus naturales (eating, drinking, suf¬ 
fering, dying, etc.) which are common to all men, it performs also 
actus personates (forgiving sins, executing judgment, etc.) which 
are the direct result of its intimate communion with the divine 
nature. 

As the personal union, so also the communion of natures is 
proved by such personal propositions as “God is man” and “Man 
is God”; for these propositions predicate a real communion of 
the natures in Christ. To the objection of the Zwinglians (Nes- 
torians) that the personal propositions, so far as the communion 
of natures is concerned (quoad communionem naturarum), are 
only nominal (propositiones verbales, propositiones tropicae), we 
reply that in that case also the incarnation, the personal union, 
and the entire doctrine of Scripture concerning the person of Christ 
must be regarded as nominal or figurative; for what is true of 
a part of a mystery is true of the whole of it. Indeed, if we must 
regard as nominal or tropical in Scripture everything to which 
man’s blind reason opposes itself, then, in the last analysis, every 
article of faith must be denied. 

Against Eutychianism and Nestorianism the Formula of Con¬ 
cord (Art. VIII, 1311.) declares: “The two natures were united 
not as two boards are glued together, so that they realiter, i. e., in 
deed and truth, have no communion whatever with one another” 
(against Nestorius and Samosatenus), nor by “a mixing or equal¬ 
izing of the natures, as when hydromel is made from honey and 
water, which is no longer pure honey and water, but a mixed drink” 
(against Eutyches), but as “the soul and body, and fire and iron, 



272 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


which have communion with each other, not by a phrase or mode 
of speaking or in mere words, but truly and really.” 

Against the errors of the Calvinists (Nestorians), papists, and 
Eutychians our dogmaticians have in summary described the per¬ 
meation of the two natures (negixd>gr]oi<;') as follows: It is a) tn- 
tima et perfectissima, intimate and most perfect; b) mutua, the 
divine nature permeating the human and the assumed flesh being 
completely permeated by the divine nature; c) inseparabilis 
(dx(oQiarog); d) without confusion, mingling, or changing (dovy- 
Xviog, uLiiazog, digemog), yet so that the two natures of Christ 
are united continuously {ddiaoxaroi, sive sibi mutuo praesentes) 
and are never outside each other (nuspiam ultra, nuspiam extra). 

6. THE COMMUNICATION OF ATTRIBUTES. 

(De Communicatione Idiomatum.) 

Since the personal union cannot be perfect and permeant 
(perichoristic) without the participation of properties, the com¬ 
munication of attributes (communicatio idiomatum) of the two 
natures in Christ is the necessary result of the personal union. 
When the Son of God assumed into His person true human nature, 
He assumed also the properties which belong to human nature (to 
be a creature, to be born, to suffer, die, ascend and descend, move 
about, etc.). All who deny the communication of attributes must 
deny also the personal union, or the paramount mystery that the 
Word was made flesh. 

Hollaz describes the communication of attributes (communi¬ 
catio idiomatum) thus: “The communication of attributes is the 
true and real participation of the properties of the divine and 
human natures resulting from the personal union in Christ, the 
God-man, who is denominated from either or both natures.” 
( Doctr. Theol., p. 321.) 

By the term properties (ldiu>juaxa, propria) , which is here used 
in its wider sense, we understand not only the natural properties 
themselves, but also what they do and what they suffer (Ivegyrjfiaxa 
xal dnoxekiofiaxa, actiones et passiones) , by which the properties 
exert themselves (to create — to be created; to give life — to 
lose life). 

While the idiomata of the two natures are attributed to the 
concrete of both natures (Christ — the God-man) or to the con¬ 
crete of either of the two natures (God — the Son of Man), it does 
not follow from this that the properties of the one nature become 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


273 


those of the other (God is not mortal; man is not eternal); for 
by the personal union the two natures are not changed in substance, 
but each retains the idiomata essential or the idiomata natural to 
itself. ( Doctr. Theol., p. 313.) Therefore it is only to the person 
that without further distinction the idiomata of the one or the 
other nature can be ascribed. This truth will be considered more 
fully later on. 

When we speak of the “concrete of the divine nature” we mean 
such terms as God, Son of God, the loyog, etc.; when we speak of 
the “concrete of the human nature,” we mean such terms as Man, 
Son of Man, Son of Mary, etc.; when we speak of the “concrete 
of the person,” or of both natures, we mean such terms as Christ, 
Messiah, Immanuel, etc., which properly signify the person con¬ 
sisting of both natures. 

Although every truth that will be set forth under the head of 
“Communication of Attributes” is already embraced in the doctrine 
of the personal union, we nevertheless treat the teachings of Scrip¬ 
ture on this score under three distinct heads in order that the 
doctrine of the communication of attributes may be perceived the 
more readily and the antithesis of errorists may be refuted the 
more efficiently. Accordingly we speak of Three Genera of the 
Communication of Attributes. 

THE FIBST GENUS (GENUS IDIOMATICTJM). 

The first genus of the communication of attributes Hollaz 
describes as follows: “The first genus of communicatio idiomatum 
consists in this, that such properties as are peculiar to the divine 
or the human nature are truly and really ascribed to the entire 
person of Christ, designated by either nature or by both natures.” 
{Doctr. Theol., p. 314.) 1 Cor. 2, 8: “They crucified the Lord of 

Glory”; Acts 3,15: “And [ye] hilled the Prince of Life”; Heb. 
13, 8: “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and to-day and forever”; 
John 8, 58: “Before Abraham was, I am,” etc. In all these and 
similar passages peculiarities of either nature are ascribed to the 
whole person. 

The first genus of the communication of attributes receives 
its importance from the fact that errorists at all times misinter¬ 
preted the Scripture-passages which ascribe human or divine pecu¬ 
liarities to the entire person of Christ. Thus it has been denied 
that the human idiomata “to be bom,” “to suffer,” “to die,” may 
be properly predicated of the Son of God. Nestorius objected to 

18 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



274 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


the teaching of the Christian Church by which Mary was called 
deozoxos, or “Mother of God.” Zwingli resorted to a figure of 
speech (dXXoia)o(g) to exclude the Son of God from the suffering 
and death of Christ. According to Zwingli “Christ suffered” means 
“The human nature suffered”; “My flesh is meat indeed” means 
“My divine nature is meat indeed.” In short, both Nestorius and 
Zwingli denied that “the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth 
us from all sin,” 1 John 1, 7, in other words, that the suffering and 
death of Christ were the suffering and death of God. 

Nevertheless Scripture affirms this very fact. God’s Son was 
made of a woman (Gal. 4, 4) and suffered and died (1 Cor. 2, 8); 
and it is this very fact that Qod suffered and died for us which 
gives to the blood of Christ the power to cleanse from sin, 
1 John 1, 7. Holy Scripture thus ascribes to the entire person of 
Christ two kinds of properties, one divine and the other human, 
though in such cases it designates the nature according to which 
the property in question is ascribed to the whole person. Eom. 1, 3: 
“His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, was made of the seed of David 
according to the flesh.” Sometimes the properties are predicated 
of the concrete of the divine nature (Son of God, Lord of Glory, 
Prince of Life), sometimes of the concrete of the human nature 
(Son of David, Son of Man), and sometimes of the concrete of 
both natures (Christ, Immanuel, our Lord Jesus Christ), but the 
attributes are always regarded as belonging to the entire Christ. 

In this manner Scripture ascribes to Christ eternity (John 
8, 58) and time (Luke 3, 23) ; the eternal generation from the 
Father (John 1, 14. 18; Eom. 8, 32) and the birth, in time, of 
Mary (Gal. 4,4; Luke 1,35; 2,7); omniscience (John 21,17; 
2, 24. 25) and limited knowledge (Luke 2, 52; Mark 13, 32); 
omnipotence (Matt. 28,18; Mark 4, 39) and limited power (John 
18, 12); life, essential and absolute (1 John 1, 2; John 10, 18; 
5, 26), and death and resurrection (Matt. 16, 21; 1 Cor. 2, 8; Acts 
3,15). Both kinds of attributes, the divine and the human, belong 
to Christ equally, really, and truly, because both natures, the divine 
and human, really and truly belong to Him. However, the divine 
attributes belong to Christ according to His divine nature, while 
the human attributes belong to Him according to His human 
nature, as Scripture clearly indicates by the diacritical particles 
(particular diacriticae), as in Eom. 1,3; 9,5. 

When describing Christ’s work of redemption, it is preferable 
to employ the concrete expressions: “The Son of God suffered and 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


275 


died” instead of the abstract: “Divinity suffered and died,” because 
these may be taken in the sense of Theopaschitism (Theopassi- 
anism). Yet, rightly understood, these terms may be justified. 
Luther and the dogmaticians of the 16th century employed them 
frequently in the sense of “Divinity in the flesh.” (Cp. Col. 2, 9: 
“the fulness of the Godhead.”) — In passing, we may add that our 
dogmaticians never asserted that God in His nature can suffer 
and die. What they taught is that Christ, the incarnate Son of 
God, who is true God and true man, suffered and died according 
to His human nature. 

THE SECOND GENUS (GENUS MAI ES TATI CUM). 

The second genus of communication of attributes is that by 
which the Son of God, because of the personal union, truly and 
really communicates the properties of His own divine nature to 
His assumed human nature for common possession, use, and desig¬ 
nation (Hollaz), As the genus idiomaticum , so also the genus 
maiestaticum follows of necessity from the personal union; for since 
the human nature has been assumed into the person of the Xoyog, 
it partakes of the entire glory and majesty of the divine nature 
and therefore also of its divine attributes, John 1,14; 5, 27; 6, 51. 
If the incarnation is at all real, then also the communication of 
divine attributes to the human nature must be real, since by the 
personal union not only the person, but also the divine nature, 
which cannot be separated from the person, has entered into com¬ 
munion with the human nature. 

Yet this important truth, which Scripture so clearly attests, 
has been emphatically denied. In particular it has been claimed 
that the human nature cannot receive divine omnipotence, omnis¬ 
cience, and omnipresence, since the finite is incapable of these 
infinite properties (Reformed, papists). In fact, as the errorists 
claim, the human nature would be destroyed if the divine idiomata 
would be forced upon it. Hence by the personal union the human 
nature of Christ received, not omnipotence, but only very great 
power; not omniscience, but only very great knowledge; not omni¬ 
presence, but only an exalted local presence at the right hand 
of God. In short, according to the Reformed doctrine the human 
nature of Christ received not divine gifts, but only extraordinary 
finite gifts, of which human nature in general is capable. But this 
denial of the communication of the divine attributes to the human 
nature is a denial also of the personal union; for if the human 
nature of Christ could not participate in the divine attributes, it 



276 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


could not be received into the person of the loyog, so that no incar¬ 
nation could take place. Practically therefore the Reformed and 
the papists, by rejecting the doctrine of the communication of 
attributes, repudiate the doctrine of the incarnation (personal 
union), though in theory they maintain it. 

In opposition to the Reformed and papistic error. Scripture 
affirms that Christ according to His human nature did in time 
receive divine omnipotence (Matt. 28, 18: “All power is given 
to Me”; John 5,27: “authority to execute Judgment”; 6,51: 
power to quicken; cp. also Matt. 16, 27; Acts 17, 31), divine 
omniscience (Col. 1, 19; 2, 3. 9), divine omnipresence (Matt. 
18,20; 28,20; John 3,13; Eph. 1,23; 4,10), divine majesty 
(Matt. 11, 27; Luke 1, 33; John 6, 62; Phil. 2, 6; Heb. 2, 7), 
divine glory (Matt. 26, 64; Mark 14, 62; Rom. 8, 34; Eph. 1, 20; 
4,10; Heb. 8,1). In addition to these passages the genus maiesta- 
ticum is clearly taught in John 1,14, where it is expressly stated 
that the glory which was given to the human nature was beheld 
even in Christ’s state of humiliation, and in Col. 2, 9, where the 
fulness of the Godhead is said to dwell bodily in Christ, so that 
indeed the entire divine essence was communicated to the body, 
or human nature, of Christ. 

In accordance with Scripture we therefore maintain that the 
human nature of Christ through the personal union came into 
possession of all the divine attributes of the koyog, not indeed essen¬ 
tially (formaliter), but by communication (per communicationem) ; 
and just that is what we mean to affirm by the second genus of the 
communication of attributes. 

For further explanation of the genus maiestaticum we add the 
following: — 

a. We must distinguish between the possession ( xzrjaig) and 
the use ( XQfjoig ) of the divine attributes communicated to the 
human nature. So far as the possession is concerned, the divine 
properties were communicated to the human nature at one and the 
same time, namely, at the very moment or act of unition (con¬ 
ception), so that even the infant Jesus was in possession of the 
entire divine majesty and glory, John 1, 14; Luke 1, 35. Yet 
Christ refrained from the full use of His imparted majesty during 
the state of humiliation, though rays of divine omnipotence, om¬ 
niscience, etc., frequently manifested themselves, John 12, 28; 
Matt. 3,17; John 14,11; 11,43f.; Matt. 17, 2ff. The full and 
constant exercise of the communicated majesty did not begin until 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


277 


His exaltation to the right hand of God, Eph. 1, 23; 4, 10; 
Phil. 2, 9ff. 

b. Reciprocation, which indeed has a place in the first genus, 
does not occur in the genus maiestaticum; for there cannot be 
a humiliation, emptying, or lessening of the divine nature 
(xandvcooig, xivcooig, IXdxxcoois), as there is an advancement, or 
exaltation {fieXxiojon. r, vnegvxpwotg), of the human nature. The 
divine nature is unchangeable and therefore cannot be perfected 
or diminished, exalted or humiliated. The promotion therefore 
belongs to the nature that is assumed, not to that which assumes. 
(Quenstedt.) 

Our Lutheran Confessions therefore reject the so-called fourth 
genus ( genus xaneivcoxixov), by which Christ according to His 
divine nature had laid aside and abandoned in His state of 
humiliation “all power in heaven and earth.” (Cf. Formula of 
Concord, Epit., VIII, 39.) Our Confessions rightly point out that 
by this “blasphemous perversion” “the way is prepared for the 
accursed Arian heresy, so that finally the eternal deity of Christ 
is denied and thus Christ and with Him our salvation are entirely 
lost.” (Cf. the error of kenoticism.) 

c. The human nature of Christ, in addition to its essential 
properties, possessed also more excellent finite gifts than sinful 
mortals have; these must be ascribed to it because of its perfection 
and sinlessness, Luke 2, 47. 52. However, in addition to these gifts 
“truly divine, uncreated, infinite, and immeasurable gifts,” or “all 
the divine attributes” of the divine nature were imparted to Christ 
according to His human nature through the personal union, Col. 
2, 3. 9, for full and external exercise in and after His exaltation, 
Phil. 2, 9ff. 

d. Since the divine nature communicated to the human nature 
its own attributes, we ascribe the divine idiomata to Christ accord¬ 
ing to both His divine and His human nature. But to the divine 
nature we ascribe them essentially, or as inherently belonging to 
this nature, while to the human nature we ascribe them by way 
of communication (per communicationem). So Scripture speaks: 
“The fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Christ,” Col. 2, 9, and 
so we avoid the error that the communication occurred through “an 
essential or natural infusion of the properties of the divine nature 
into the human.” This error our Confessions condemn, declaring: 
“In no way is conversion, confusion, or equalization of the natures 
in Christ or of their essential attributes to be maintained or ad¬ 
mitted.” ( Formula of Concord, Art. VIII, 62 ff.) 



278 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


On account of the controversies on this matter it is necessary 
to consider in detail the individual divine properties which accord¬ 
ing to Scripture were communicated to the human nature. 

a. Omniscience. According to John 3, 34, the Spirit was given 
to the human nature of Christ without measure (ovx lx juhgov). 
Since the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge, 
Is. 11,2; 1 Cor. 2,10. 11, Christ according to His human nature 
therefore received infinite divine wisdom and knowledge. Hence 
we distinguish in Christ a twofold knowledge, namely, the infinite 
divine knowledge which the divine nature communicated to the 
human nature through the personal union (actus ■personalis) and 
the knowledge which the human nature possessed as natural and 
essential (actus naturalis). The first is infinite knowledge, or 
omniscience (divina omniscientia); the second, finite knowledge, 
capable of growth (scientia naturalis, habitualis, experimentalis). 
It is the latter knowledge of which the evangelist speaks; Luke 
2, 52: “Jesus increased in wisdom.” The infinite, divine knowl¬ 
edge which was communicated to Christ’s human nature is attested 
in Col. 2, 3. 

The passage Mark 13, 32 does not deny the communication of 
infinite, divine knowledge to the human nature, but rather describes 
the incarnate Christ in His state of humiliation when He abstained 
from the full use of His communicated attributes. Christ accord¬ 
ing to His human nature employed His communicated divine gifts 
only as these were necessary for His redemptive work. The re¬ 
demption of sinful man, however, did not require the promulgation 
of the time and hour when the day of Judgment should take place. 
If the Reformed object that it is impossible to conceive of the 
communicated, divine knowledge as partly quiescent (actus primus) 
and partly operative (actus secundus), we remind them of the fact 
that the human mind is incapable of understanding the “mystery 
of godliness,” 1 Tim. 3,16, either in whole or in part. Neverthe¬ 
less the relation between Christ’s operative and inoperative knowl¬ 
edge may be somewhat illustrated by the human soul, which during 
sleep knows and yet does not know. Both the Reformed and the 
papists, who deny the communication of divine knowledge to 
Christ’s human nature, must be regarded as errorists on this point 
(Agnoetae), since they affirm that the Son of Man, even in His 
state of exaltation, is ignorant of many things. 

b. Omnipotence. That Christ according to His human nature 
received divine omnipotence is a truth clearly taught in Scripture, 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


279 


Dan. 7, 13. 14; Matt. 28, 18; Heb. 2, 8. Even in His state of 
humiliation He was endowed with almighty power, Matt. 11, 27; 
John 13, 3; 3, 35; Is. 9, 6ff., so that He could heal the sick, Matt. 
4,23; Mark 1, 34; Luke 4,40, cast out devils, Luke 4,41; 11,14, 
raise the dead, John 5, 21; 12,1, and, in short, perform all mir¬ 
acles which according to prophecy the divine Messiah was to accom¬ 
plish, Is. 35, 4—6; 61,1. 2; Luke 4,17—21; Matt. 11, 4—6. 

That Christ possessed divine omnipotence also according to 
His human nature is proved especially by those passages which 
expressly declare that this divine property was given to Him as 
the Son of Man, John 5, 26. 27; Matt. 16, 27; Luke 22, 69; Dan. 
7, 13. 14; Col. 2, 9. Hence the Son of Man performed His mir¬ 
acles not as a mere agent, acting in the name of His Father 
(instrumentum Segyov), but by His own power (instrumentum 
avvegyov), as Scripture expressly points out, John 2,11; 6, 51—58. 

With respect to the passages which state that divine properties 
were given to Christ in time, John 5, 26. 27; 13, 3; Matt. 11, 27; 
28,18, the canon of the ancient Christian Church obtains: “What¬ 
ever Christ received in time He received according to His human 
nature, not according to the divine.” In other words, they refer 
not to His eternal generation, but to His incarnation. “Whatever 
Scripture says that the Word received [in time] ... it says on 
account of His humanity and not on account of His divinity ." 
(Athanasius. Triglot, p. 1117.) 

Besides the infinite, divine power which Christ received ac¬ 
cording to His human nature, He, in His state of humiliation, 
possessed also finite, or limited, power, since to make His redemp¬ 
tive work possible. He did not always and fully exercise the divine 
prerogatives communicated to His human nature, 2 Cor. 8, 9; John 
10,17.18; Phil. 2, 6—8. Only in this way could He “increase in 
wisdom,” Luke 2, 52, and suffer and die, Phil. 2,8; though even 
in the state of humiliation He did not always conceal His divine 
power, John 11, 40—44. The emphatic opposition which the Re¬ 
formed theologians offer to the Scriptural doctrine of Christ’s com¬ 
municated omnipotence is evident from the statement of Hodge: 
“The human nature of Christ is no more omniscient or almighty 
than the worker of a miracle is omnipotent.” ( Syst . Theol., 
II, 417.) 

c. Omnipresence. As Holy Scripture ascribes to Christ’s 
human nature omniscience and omnipotence, so it ascribes to it 
also omnipresence, Matt. 28,18—20; Eph. 1, 20—23; 4,10. The 



280 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


omnipresence of Christ’s human nature, however, is taught also 
John 1,14 and Col. 2, 9; for these passages declare that wherever, 
after the incarnation, the Xoyog is present, He is present as the 
Xoyo*; SvoaQxot; (Filius Dei incarnatus). (Neque Xoyog extra car- 
nem, neque caro extra Xoyov.) 

Our dogmaticians, on the basis of Scripture, very emphatically 
reject the so-called extra illud Calvinisticum, according to which the 
X6yog so united Himself with human nature that He indeed alto¬ 
gether inhabits it, yet at the same time, because He is immense 
and infinite, exists and works also altogether outside the human 
nature. The extra Calvinisticum is not only unscriptural, but 
also self-contradictory. 

While the Reformed regard the whole doctrine of the com¬ 
munication of attributes as preposterous, they condemn in par¬ 
ticular the Scriptural truth of Christ’s communicated omnipresence 
as a monstrous figment (monstrosum figmentum) or a monster 
of impiety (impium monstrum). (Cp. Pieper, Christliche Dog- 
matik, II, 183 ff.) Denying the personal presence of Christ’s 
human nature, they affirm a presence only of its efficacy, and they 
charge their Lutheran opponents with teaching the nonsensical 
view of ubiquity, or of the local extension of the human nature, 
though the Lutheran theologians have always rejected this as 
a puerile fancy; for they explain the omnipresence of Christ’s 
human nature not by way of local extension, but by way of His 
illocal, supernatural mode of presence. 

All the arguments of the Reformed against Christ’s omni¬ 
presence which are based upon Christ’s ascension into heaven, His 
sitting at the right hand, His second advent, etc., as if these acts 
presupposed a mere local presence, rest upon a childish conception 
of God and heavenly matters. Equally groundless is the argument 
that every real body must always be contained in space, so that 
Christ’s human nature must be viewed as always occupying space. 
The universe certainly is a created material body; yet it is not 
in space, but in God, Acts 17, 28. 

As the human nature received divine omniscience and om¬ 
nipotence in the first moment of the personal union, so also divine 
omnipresence. This does not mean that the human nature through 
the personal union lost its natural properties in such a manner 
that the body of Christ ceased to be at any particular place; for 
the omnipresence of the human nature was not “physical, diffu¬ 
sive, expansive, gross, local, corporeal, and divisible,” but divine

and supernatural. Our dogmaticians Tightly distinguish between 
Christ’s simple omnipresence (nuda adessentia, praesentia partialis, 
ddiaaxaaia) and His triumphant omnipresence (omnipraesentia 
totalis, omnipraesentia modificata), which is always connected with 
divine dominion. The first mode Christ possessed in the state 
of humiliation, John 1,14; Col. 2, 9; John 3,13, since after the 
incarnation the Aoyoe is never outside the flesh. The latter mode 
Christ possesses since His exaltation, Eph. 1, 20—23; 4,10. 

Besides the divine omnipresence, which was communicated to 
it through the personal union (actus personalis, praesentia illocalis, 
supernaturalis, repletiva), the human nature of Christ, in His 
state of humiliation, possessed also a local mode of presence (actus 
naturalis, praesentia localis), Luke 2,12. 

On the basis of Holy Scripture our dogmaticians thus ascribe 
to the human nature of Christ three modes of presence, namely, 
a) praesentia localis, praesentia circumscriptiva, b) praesentia illo¬ 
calis, praesentia definitiva, John 20,19, and c) praesentia repletiva, 
divina, supernaturalis, Eph. 1,23; 4,10. (Cf. Ohristl. Dogmatik, 
II, 195 ff.) To these modes of presence may be added the prae¬ 
sentia sacramentalis, according to which Christ’s body is truly 
present in the Lord’s Supper, Matt. 26, 26. 

The “sitting at the right hand of God” must not be referred 
to a “circumscribed or physical locality,” since, as Gerhard rightly 
comments, “the right hand of God is not a bodily, circumscribed, 
limited, definite place, but the infinite power of God and His most 
efficacious majesty in heaven and earth, or the most efficacious 
dominion by which God preserves and governs all things,” Ps. 
18,35; 44,3; 108,6; 63, 8, etc. So also Hollaz writes: “To sit 
at God’s right hand means, by virtue of the personal union and the 
exaltation following this, to govern all the works of God’s hands 
most powerfully, most efficaciously, and most gloriously, 1 Cor. 
15, 25 27; Ps. 110, 1. 2; Heb. 2, 7. 8.” (Cp. Doctr. Theol., 
p. 403 ff.) 

d. Adoration. As Holy Scripture ascribes to Christ according 
to His human nature divine majesty and glory, Col. 2, 9, so it 
ascribes to Him also divine adoration, John 5, 20—23; Phil. 2, 
9—11; Rev. 5, 9. 10. The Reformed and papists, who deny adora¬ 
tion to Christ’s human nature on the basis of Is. 42, 8; Jer. 17, 5, 
show by this denial that in spite of their statements to the contrary 
they hold the Nestorian doctrine, separate the two natures in Christ, 
and deny the mystery of the Incarnation (personal union). All 



282 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


who rightly teach the personal union never regard the human 
nature as separate from, but always as united with, the divine 
nature in the one, indivisible person of Christ, so that he who 
adores the divine nature at the same time adores the human nature, 
or the incarnate Christ. 

The question has been debated whether, in connection with 
the second genus, such abstract expressions as “The human nature 
of Christ is quickening” or “The human nature is almighty,” etc., 
should not be replaced by the concrete expression “Christ is quick¬ 
ening” or “The Son of Man is almighty,” since the former may 
mislead the untrained to believe that the human nature apart from 
the personal union (in abstracto reali) is endowed with such power 
or that the human nature possesses divine omnipotence as a special 
gift apart from the omnipotence of the divine nature. 

Such misunderstandings must certainly be corrected; however, 
the use of these expressions should not be condemned, since Scrip¬ 
ture itself employs them, John 6,51; 1 John 1,7. In addition, 
they most emphatically affirm the doctrine of the communication 
of attributes, or the Scriptural truth that in Christ the two natures, 
with all their attributes, are most intimately united, not only the 
so-called operative ( attributa operativa, ivegyr/Tixa), as omnipo¬ 
tence, omniscience, but also the quiescent ( attributa quiescentia, 
dvevigyrjTa), as eternity, infinity, immensity. Col. 2, 9; John 
1,14, etc. 

Luther writes on this point: “According to the other, the 
temporal, human birth, also the eternal power of God has been 
given Him; however, in time and not from eternity. For the 
humanity of Christ has not been from eternity like the divinity; 
but as we reckon and write, Jesus, the Son of Mary, is 1543 years 
old this year. But from the instant when divinity and humanity 
were united in one person, the man, the Son of Mary, is, and is 
called, almighty, eternal God, who has eternal might and has created 
and sustains all things per communicationem idiomatum for the 
reason that He is one person with the divinity and is also true 
God.” ( Formula of Concord, Thor. Decl., VIII, 85.) 

It must be noted, however, that Scripture, though it ascribes 
to the human nature the “fulness of the Godhead,” Col. 2,9, never 
predicates directly of Christ’s human nature the quiescent attri¬ 
butes (eternity, immensity, infinity), but only the operative attri¬ 
butes (omnipotence, omnipresence, omniscience, etc.). The reason 
for this our dogmaticians give as follows: In spite of the per- 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


283 


sonal union the divine properties remain the essential attributes of 
the divine nature and never become the essential attributes of the 
human nature by transfusion. But they are predicated of the 
human nature in so far as they become active in the human nature 
as in the body of Christ (the human nature quickens, executes 
Judgment, etc.). Hence we ascribe divine omnipotence to the 
human nature not as an essential attribute, but in so far as the 
Son of God exerts His divine omnipotence in His human nature, 
which through the personal union is united with His divine nature. 
On the other hand, those divine properties which within the divine 
essence remain quiescent and do not exert themselves ad extra 
cannot be predicated directly of the human nature. 

To the objection of the Reformed that, unless all divine attri¬ 
butes may be predicated of the human nature, none whatever can 
be ascribed to it, we reply: — 

a. Also in this matter we adhere strictly to Scripture, which 
indeed ascribes to the human nature of Christ divine omnipotence, 
omniscience, and omnipresence, but not eternity, infinity, im¬ 
mensity, etc. For this reason the “either-or” of the Reformed must 
be rejected as anti-Scriptural. 

b. But this rationalistic “either-or” is also unreasonable; just 
as unreasonable indeed as if one would argue: “If the human body, 
through its union with the soul, is endowed with life, it must like¬ 
wise become immaterial. But since it does not become immaterial, 
it does not become alive.” Now, as the soul imparts life to the 
body (an operative attribute), but not immateriality (an inopera¬ 
tive attribute), just so according to Scripture the divine nature of 
Christ directly exerts in the human nature its operative, but not 
its quiescent attributes. 

Yet Christ’s quiescent attributes are not entirely excluded 
from His theanthropic activity; for they are exerted ad extra 
through the operative attributes. As God made the world in time 
through His eternal and immense omnipotence, so also Christ 
raised Lazarus from the dead by the infinite power of His eternal 
Godhead. 

Moreover, Scripture expressly describes the omnipotence which 
was communicated to the Son of Man as infinite. Dan. 7, 14: 
“And there was given Him dominion and glory. . . . His dominion 
is an everlasting dominion.” In this passage the quiescent attri¬ 
bute of eternity is clearly predicated of Christ’s human nature; 
for the glory which the Son of Man received is everlasting. So 



284 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


also, according to John 17, 5, Christ was glorified with eternal 
glory; for His human nature, as He says Himself, received the 
same glory which He, as the preexistent Aoyog, had before the 
world was. (Cp. Formula of Concord, VIII, 48 ff.) 

THE THIRD GENUS OF THE COMMUHICATIOH OF ATTRIBUTES. 

(Genus Apotelesm&ticum.) 

Gerhard defines the third genus of the communication of attri¬ 
butes as “that by which in official acts each nature performs what 
is peculiar to itself, with the participation, however, of the other.” 
1 Cor. 15, 3; Gal. 1, 4; Eph. 5, 2. The supreme importance of 
this genus becomes apparent when we consider that Christ could 
accomplish His work of redemption only because in Him the divine 
and the human nature were joined together. 

Chemnitz writes very aptly on this matter: “This union of 
the kingship and priesthood of the Messiah was made in the in¬ 
terest of the work of redemption for our sake and for the sake of 
our salvation. But as redemption had to be made by means of 
suffering and death, there was need of a human nature. So it 
pleased God that for our comfort, in the offices of the kingship, 
priesthood, and lordship of Christ, our assumed nature should also 
be employed and thus the [official] acts {dnoTeUofxaxa.) of Christ’s 
offices should be accomplished in, with, and through both.” ( Doctr . 
Theol., p. 337.) 

The special treatment of this genus has been rendered neces¬ 
sary by the antithesis of the Reformed, who teach that both natures 
in the work of redemption acted their parts alone, each without 
participation of the other. Similarly they claim that the human 
nature of Christ contributed to the miracles only as a mere or 
passive instrument ( instrumentum fcgyov); that it contributed no 
more to them than did the hem of the garment which the woman 
touched, Matt. 9, 20; or than did the human nature of the apostles. 
Acts 3, 6, or the rod of Aaron, Ex. 8,16. Calvin called the merit 
of Christ directly the merit of a man and thus excluded the divine 
nature from the active acquisition of salvation for men. This is 
in full accord with the Reformed view according to which the com¬ 
munication of the official acts of Christ (dnoTeMo/LiaTa) cannot be 
referred to the communicatio idiomatum. Practically this means 
that the human nature of Christ must be excluded from all works 
of our Savior which involve divine omnipotence, omnipresence, and 
omniscience. Again, they aver that the omnipresence of Christ in 
His Church, Eph. 1, 20—23; 4,10, pertains not to His human 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


285 


nature, but to the divine nature exclusively, so that Christ’s human 
nature is no more present with the Church than is that of Abraham 
or Paul in glory. For this reason it has become necessary to treat 
the third genus of the communication of attributes with special 
emphasis. 

By the term official acts (djtoxeXeopaxa) we understand all 
functions which Christ as the Savior of all men performed in the 
state of humiliation and still performs in His state of exaltation, 
such as dying for the sins of the world, destroying the works of 
the devil, being present with, and ruling and protecting, His 
Church, etc. The Scripture-passages which predicate these official 
works may be grouped as follows: a) such as describe Christ’s 
official functions by a concrete term (nomen officii concretum), as 
Savior, Mediator, Prophet, King, High Priest, etc.; b) such as 
describe particular official acts of Christ, as, for example, to bear 
the sins of the world, John 1, 29; to die for the sins of the world, 
1 Cor. 15, 3; to give Himself for our sins, Gal. 1, 4; to give Him¬ 
self for us an offering and a sacrifice to God, Eph. 5, 2; to destroy 
the works of the devil, 1 John 3, 8; to bruise the Serpent’s head, 
Gen. 3,15. 

If the question is asked according to which nature Christ 
performed His official functions for the salvation of the world, we 
reply on the basis of Scripture: No matter whether, in the par¬ 
ticular passages of Holy Writ which predicate the dnoxsXiopaxa, 
the Savior is described according to both natures (1 Tim. 1, 15. 
Christ Jesus) or according to one nature only, either the divine 
(Acts 20,28: God) or the human (Matt. 18,11: Son of Man), 
the works of His office are always performed by the entire person 
according to both natures, inasmuch as each nature contributes that 
which is proper to it and thus acts in communion with, or with 
the participation of, the other. CAnoxekeo/uaxa sunt operationes 
deavdQixai.) 

This is the true Scripture doctrine, which also the ancient 
Church believed and confessed. Athanasius writes: “God the 
Word, having been united with man, performs miracles, not apart 
from the human nature; on the contrary, it has pleased Him to 
work His divine power through it and in it and with it.” ( Catalog 
of Testimonies . Triglot, p. 1141.) And Leo the Great: “Each 
nature does what is peculiar to it in communion with the other, 
namely, the Word working what belongs to the Word [the Son of 
God] and the flesh executing what belongs to the flesh.” (Ibid., 
p. 1109.) 



286 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


It is true, Christ indeed suffered and died according to His 
human nature, yet by virtue of the personal union the divine nature 
participated in the suffering and death of the human nature; for 
the human nature was always united with the divine nature, and 
from this union the holy, vicarious Passion of our Savior received 
its redemptive value. So Gerhard declares: “The sufferings and 
bloody death of Christ would have been without a saving result if 
the divine nature had not added a price of infinite value to the 
sufferings and death which He endured for us.” ( Doctr. Theol., 
p. 336.) And Chemnitz: “If the redemption, atonement, etc., could 
have been accomplished by the divine nature alone or by the human 
nature alone, the loyoc would have descended in vain from heaven 
for us men and for our salvation and become incarnate.” (Ibid.) 

Gerhard is indeed right when, commenting on 1 John 3, 8, he 
remarks: “The Son of God assumed human nature for the very 
purpose that in, with, and through it He might accomplish the 
work of redemption and the several functions of His mediatorial 
office.” 

It is for the reason just stated that the third genus must be 
maintained in its Scriptural purity; for upon it rests the entire 
comfort which the Gospel of reconciliation proclaims to lost and 
fallen man. Those who deny this genus rob the Christian believer 
of the sweetest comfort which he has, namely, of the Gospel truth 
that “the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all 
sin,” 1 John 1, 7. 

Fortunately the opponents of the genus apotelesmaticum do 
not draw the conclusions which their false premises really suggest, 
but by a strange, yet fortunate, inconsistency retract in practise 
what they maintain in theory. Hodge, e. g., says at one place: 
“A soul which is omniscient ... is not a human soul. The Christ 
of the Bible and of the human heart is lost if this doctrine be 
true . . . ; omniscience is not an attribute of which a creature can 
be made the organ”; but at another place: “Such expressions as 
Dei mors, Dei passio, Dei sanguis, have the sanction of Scriptural 
as well as Church usage. It follows from this that the satisfaction 
of Christ has ail the value which belongs to the obedience and 
sufferings of the eternal Son of God, and His righteousness, as well 
active as passive, is infinitely meritorious.” (Syst. Theol., II, 
416. 168.) It is this very truth which the Lutherans mean to 
emphasize by their doctrine of the genus apotelesmaticum.

B. The Doctrine of the States of Christ. 

(De Statibus Exinanitionis et Exaltationis.) 

1. DEFINITION OF CHRIST’S STATE OF HUMILIATION. 

The incarnation of Christ consisted essentially in the para¬ 
mount miracle that the Son of God, with the fulness of the God¬ 
head, entered into an indissoluble personal union with the human 
nature, John 1,14; Col. 2, 9. Hence from the very moment of 
its conception, Luke 1, 35, the human nature of Christ was in pos¬ 
session (xtfjaig) of all divine attributes and of all divine majesty 
and glory, John 1, 14; 2, 11. However, in order to be able to 
redeem us by His most holy obedience (active, Gal. 4, 4. 5; passive, 
Is. 53, 4—6), Christ, from the time of His conception until His 
revivification in the grave, refrained from the full and constant use 
(■XQV 01 ^) °f His communicated attributes, majesty, and glory, Phil. 
2, 6ff. Throughout His earthly life, till the completion of His 
work of redemption, He went about in the form of a servant, 
bearing all the weaknesses and infirmities of human nature after 
the Fall and being subject to the obligation (Matt. 3,15; Gal. 
4, 4) and curse (Gal. 3,13) of the divine Law. 

This condition of self-renunciation we designate as “Christ’s 
state of humiliation” (status exinanitionis). The humiliation of 
Christ did not consist essentially in the act of the incarnation, 
although it was a most gracious condescension for the Son of God 
to assume our human nature; for while the state of humiliation 
ceased with His burial, Phil. 2, 8f., the personal union resulting 
from the incarnation never ceased, Eph. 1, 20—23; 4,10. Again, 
while in the incarnation the Son of God entered into a true and real 
union with human nature, the state of humiliation does not pertain 
to Christ’s divine, but only to His human nature (against modern 
kenoticism). Baier defines the state of humiliation as follows: 
“The state of humiliation consists in this, that Christ for a time 
renounced, truly and really, yet freely, the plenary exercise of the 
divine majesty that He might suffer and die for the life of the 
world.” (Docir. Theol.j p. 377ff.) 

The doctrine of Christ’s humiliation as set forth in the Con¬ 
fessions of the Lutheran Church is truly Scriptural. Scripture 
not only clearly establishes the doctrine of the two states of Christ, 
Phil. 2, 6—11, in general, but also ascribes to His human nature 
in the days of His flesh full possession of all divine attributes, 
majesty, and glory, John 1,14; 2,11; 5,17; Matt. 11, 27; Col. 
2, 3. 9, etc., while in other passages it presents the same Christ as 



288 


THE DOCTRINE OP CHRIST. 


not using His divine prerogatives, so that the one Christ, who is 
ineffably rich, was also poor. Matt. 8, 20; 2 Cor. 8, 9; He who is 
almighty God, John 6, 68. 69; Is. 9, 6, was also weak, Luke 22, 
42. 43; He who is the Creator and Lord of all things, John 1, 
1—4; Matt. 8, 27. 29, was also subject to man, Luke 2, 61. 52; He 
who is the Prince of Life, Acts 3,15; Rev. 1,18, was also captured 
and slain by men, Luke 22, 54. 63; 23, 33—37. 46. 

These apparently contradictory statements, Scripture explains 
by the fact that the Son of Man did not always and fully use 
the divine prerogatives which were communicated to Him as man 
(John 10,18: Christ died because He did not use His power to 
live; Phil. 2, 6—8: Christ died because He humbled Himself). 
Hence the state of humiliation became possible and real because 
Christ voluntarily refrained from the complete and uninterrupted 
use of the fulness of the Godhead, which from the very moment 
of His conception dwelled in Him bodily. 

The reason why our Savior thus abstained from the constant 
use of His plenary, communicated divine majesty is that according 
to Scripture He executed the work of redemption through His 
vicarious satisfaction, Is. 53, 1—6; 2 Cor. 5, 19—21. Had He 
always and fully used His divine majesty, as He did at His 
transfiguration and after the resurrection, Matt. 17,1—8; John 
20,17.19, He could not have become our Substitute, Phil. 2, 6—8; 
Is. 53,1—6, and could not have rendered perfect obedience, Gal. 4, 
4. 5; 3, 13, to His heavenly Father in our place. But since He 
humbled Himself (Ixb’woev) by refraining from the full and un¬ 
interrupted use of His divine majesty, assuming the form of 
a servant, appearing in the likeness of men, and so rendering per¬ 
fect obedience to His Father, Phil. 2, 6—8, He has become our true 
Redeemer (Jer. 23, 6: “the Lord our Righteousness”), whose pov¬ 
erty is our riches (2 Cor. 8, 9), whose obedience is our redemption 
(Gal. 4, 4. 5), and whose death is our propitiation (Rom. 3, 24. 25). 

Certainly, whenever it was demanded in the interest of His 
redemptive work, Christ employed His imparted majesty and glory, 
not only when performing miracles before His great Passion, John 
2,11, or when exercising His prophetic ministry, John 1,18, but 
also when, as our great High Priest, He gave Himself for us as 
an offering, Luke 23, 34; for not only was His human nature sus¬ 
tained by the imparted divine properties in the dreadful agony 
of His Passion, Matt. 26, 38. 39; 27,46, but rays of divine glory 
shone also ad extra through the intense gloom of His suffering, 
John 19,25—27; Luke 23,43. 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


289 


2. ERRONEOUS VIEWS REGARDING CHRIST’S 
HUMILIATION. 

a. The humiliation must not be regarded as identical with the 
incarnation, for in that case the humiliation would pertain to the 
divine nature inasmuch as it assumed the human nature (imdoatg), 
and the glorification would consist in the putting aside of the 
human nature. It is true, Christ’s incarnation did imply a most 
wonderful condescension, and sometimes this truth has been ex¬ 
pressed even in orthodox circles by the term “humiliation” (exina- 
nitio sensu ecclesiastica accepta). However, when Scripture speaks 
of the humiliation of Christ in its proper sense (exinanitio sensu 
biblico accepta), in which it stands in contrast to the exaltation, it 
means that Christ became man in poverty and wretchedness, or 
that He assumed the form of a servant (/uogq>r) dovXov), though He 
possessed the form of God {jioocprj deov), as Phil. 2, 6. 7 attests. 
Strong rightly says: “We may dismiss as unworthy of serious 
notice that view, that it [the humiliation] consisted essentially in 
the union of the koyog with human nature; for this union with 
human nature continues in the state of exaltation.” (Syst. Theol., 
p. 701.) 

b. The humiliation of Christ did not consist in this, that the 
Son of God, for the purpose of becoming incarnate, divested Him¬ 
self for a time of His operative, or relative, attributes, such as 
omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence, so that the divine 
nature was reduced, or diminished, by the incarnation. This is 
the doctrine of the modern kenoticists (Thomasius, Delitzsch, Lut- 
hardt, etc.). Extreme kenoticists (Gess, Hofmann, Frank) even 
claim that the Son of God in His incarnation emptied Himself of 
all divine attributes, or that His divine personality was replaced 
by a human personality. 

Kenoticism therefore undeifies Christ to account for the “true 
human development” of His human nature. But thereby it contra¬ 
dicts all Scripture-passages which declare, on the one hand, that 
Christ in His state of humiliation was one with the Father essen¬ 
tially, John 10, 30. 38; 14,10, so that His divine mode of subsis¬ 
tence was not changed by the incarnation, Col. 2, 3. 9; and, on the 
other hand, that He performed the divine works together with the 
Father, so that also His divine mode of operation was not altered 
when He became incarnate, John 5, 17—19. The doctrine of 
kenoticism is therefore rationalistic and anti-Scriptural. 

The true human development of Christ, Luke 2, 52, as well as 

19 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



290 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


His answered prayers, Luke 22,43; John 17, 5, are adequately ex¬ 
plained by Scripture when it informs us that our Savior did not 
always use the divine attributes communicated to the human 
nature; for since the Son of Man did not always employ His 
divine majesty, He could ask and receive of the Father just as any 
other man, Phil. 2, 7. 

Modern kenoticism, however, in addition to denying clear 
Scriptural facts regarding the incarnation, also commits the serious 
mistake of transforming the incorruptible God (Ps. 102, 26. 27; 
1 Tim. 6,16; Mai. 3, 6) into a being subject to change and thus 
destroys the very concept of God. Yet even so it does not accom¬ 
plish its object; for as long as kenoticists affirm a union of God 
and man, the mystery of the incarnation remains, even if God is 
conceived as minus some attributes. The mystery of the incarna¬ 
tion can be removed only by rejecting the incarnation in its entirety 
or by regarding Christ as a mere man, who is without any divine 
attributes (Modernists). 

This fact has been recognized by rationalistic theologians of 
another type (Dorner, etc.), who, in order to explain the mystery 
of the incarnation, ascribed to the human nature of Christ inde¬ 
pendent personal existence. But this rationalistic substitute is as 
unsatisfactory as is kenoticism; for it destroys the very concept of 
the incarnation, or of the assumption of human nature into the 
person of the Son of God. In that case there would be no personal 
union, but at best only a union by adoption (adoptionism). 

c. The humiliation does not consist in the mere concealment 
of the use of the divine majesty imparted to the human nature 
(xQvyng r rjg xQV OEa} ^)’ but in the real renunciation of the full use 
of the imparted majesty according to the human nature (xevcooig 
rrjg xQV aEC °s)- In the Cryptist-Kenotist Controversy, 1619—1627, 
between the Tuebingen theologians (Osiander, Nicolai, and Thum- 
mius) and the Giessen theologians (Mentzer and Feuerborn) this 
question became controverted. The Tuebingen theologians ascribed 
to the human nature of Christ the sitting at the right hand of the 
Father even in the state of humiliation, which meant that our 
Lord made full use even then of the divine majesty, though in 
a hidden way (xgvifig), whence they were called Cryptists. This 
position is untenable in the light of the Scripture-passages which 
ascribe the sitting at the right hand of God to the human nature 
of Christ in the state of exaltation. The Tuebingen theologians 
admitted, however, that Christ, in performing His sacerdotal office. 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


291 


or in His suffering and dying, renounced the full use of the divine 
majesty communicated to the human nature. The Qiessen theo¬ 
logians, on the other hand, asserted that the human nature of 
Christ in the state of humiliation was not present with all crea¬ 
tures, and they were inclined to exclude it from the preservation 
and government of the universe, Christ having thus emptied Him¬ 
self (Phil. 2, 7) according to His human nature of that much of 
the divine majesty. For this reason they were called kenotists. 
But they did not hold with the modern kenoticists that Christ 
according to His divine nature divested Himself of His divine 
attributes. They did not teach an absolute renunciation of the use 
of the divine majesty, but freely admitted this use in the case of 
miracles. Their position is untenable in the face of John 5,17. 

With regard to the terminology which the Church employs in 
connection with Christ’s states of humiliation and exaltation we 
may note the following: — 

a. The Formula of Concord employs the expressions conceal¬ 
ment (xgvyis) and non-use of the divine majesty of Christ com¬ 
municated to the human nature as synonyms. (Thor. Decl., VIII, 
26. 65: “This was concealed and withheld [for the greater part] 
at the time of the humiliation.”) This usage of the two terms 
is Scriptural; for the humiliation of Christ involved a real con¬ 
cealment of Christ’s divine majesty, inasmuch as He was true and 
very Qod, Col. 2, 9, and yet appeared as a mere man, John 19, 5. 
On the other hand, the humiliation of Christ involved also a real 
renunciation, not indeed of the attributes according to His divine 
nature, but of the appearance in the form of God (/ iog<pr] deov), 
or of the full use of His imparted divine attributes; for He posi¬ 
tively appeared in the form of a servant (nogyrj dovAov). 

b. The expressions “to be in heaven,” John 3,13, and “to sit at 
the right hand of God,” Mark 16,19, are not synonymous; for the 
first is predicated of Christ in His humiliation, while the second 
is the triumphant act of His exaltation. 

c. When describing Christ’s omnipresence according to His 
human nature, our theologians have used the expressions omni- 
praesentia intima and omnipraesentia extima. The expression 
omnipraesentia extima is used correctly when it is employed as 
synonymous with sessio ad dextram Dei. But when it is under¬ 
stood in the sense that Christ was not present with the creatures 
during His state of humiliation, it denies the personal union. The 
terms are used rightly when the one denotes the presence of the 



292 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


Son of Man before the exaltation and the other His glorious 
presence after the exaltation. 

d. It has been said that Christ before His exaltation, in the 
state of humiliation, worked in and with the human nature (in et 
cum came), but not always through the human nature (non per 
carnem). The expression non per carnem in this statement is 
Scriptural if it denotes Christ’s perpetual and triumphant use of 
the divine majesty imparted to the human nature (usus plenarius), 
or the enthronement of His human nature at the right hand of God. 
It is incorrect if it is used to deny the Scripture truth that Christ 
also in His state of humiliation performed His miracles. His 
prophetic ministry, and His work of preservation and government, 
John 5,17; 1,18, within or through the flesh, John 1,14; Col. 
2, 3. 9; for whatever Christ does after the incarnation He does not 
outside the flesh (extra carnem), but as the God-man, or as the 
incarnate Christ, 1 John 1, 7; Heb. 9,14; 2, 8. 9; John 5, 26. 27; 
j uke 22, 69; Phil. 2, 9; etc., in other words, within and thus 
tnrough the flesh. 

3. THE SEVERAL STAGES OF THE HUMILIATION. 

The humiliation of Christ embraces all events of His earthly 
life from His conception to His burial, the latter included. Christ’s 
descent into hell (descensus ad inferos) must be excluded from 
His state of humiliation, 1 Pet. 3,18; Col. 2,15. The time during 
which our Lord sojourned on earth, Scripture denominates “the 
days of His flesh,” al fj/xegai xfjg oagxog, Heb. 5, 7. Christ’s 
humiliation therefore includes: — 

a. His conception and nativity. These two events belong to 
Christ’s state of humiliation inasmuch as the incarnation, which in 
itself was not a humiliation, though a most gracious condescension, 
took place under extremely humiliating circumstances; for by His 
incarnation the Son of God took upon Himself the whole misery 
and wretchedness which sin had brought upon fallen man, 2 Cor. 
8, 9; Luke 9, 58; Phil. 2, 6. 7; Matt. 8,17. Christ was conceived 
and born as the Savior of the world, Luke 2,11; for through His 
most holy conception and birth He atoned for our sinful concep¬ 
tion and birth, Ps. 51, 5; Gal. 4, 4. 5. The virgin birth of our 
Lord is a fact clearly attested by Scripture, Is. 7,14; Matt. 1, 23; 
Luke 1, 34. God willed that the Messiah should be the Son of 
a virgin, Matt. 1, 22. 23; Is. 7, 14, true man, yet without sin, 
Heb. 7, 26. 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


293 


Luther writes: “Therefore the Seed of the Woman could not 
be an ordinary man; for He had to crush the power of the devil, 
sin, and death; and since all men are subject to the devil on ac¬ 
count of sin and death, He most assuredly had to be without sin. 
Now, human nature does not bear such seed or fruit, as said above; 
for they are all under the devil because of their sin. ... So the 
only means to accomplish the desired end was this: the Seed must 
be a truly natural Son of the woman, not bom, however, of the 
woman in a natural way, but by an extraordinary act of God, in 
order that the Scriptures might be fulfilled that He should be the 
Seed of only a woman, not of a man; for the text [Gen. 3,15] 
clearly says that He shall be the Seed of a woman.” (St. L., 
XX, 1796f.) 

Whether our Savior was born clauso utero or not we may re¬ 
gard as an open question, though this is possible on account of the 
communication of attributes. (Cp. Formula of Concord, Thor. 
Decl., VIII, 24; VII, 100.) The denial of the virgin birth of our 
Savior by rationalists and Modernists (Th. Kaftan: It is “worth¬ 
less from a religious point of view,” “religioes wertlos”) is contrary 
to the express testimony of Scripture and is a result and proof 
of their unbelief. 

The question whether Mary afterwards in her marriage with 
Joseph had children or not (semper virgo) the ancient Church as 
well as Luther and the older Lutheran dogmaticians have answered 
in the negative, while the opinions of more recent exegetes are 
divided on the matter. The question is a purely historical one 
and may be left open since Scripture does not answer it with suffi¬ 
cient clearness. Cp. Matt. 1, 25; Luke 2, 7; Matt. 12, 46 3.; 
13,553.; John 2,12; 7, 3ff.; Gal. 1,19. (Cp. Pieper, Christliche 
Dogmatik, II, 3663.) Eusebius, III, 11, according to Hegesippus: 
“Alphaeus (Cleophas) was a brother of Joseph, who after the death 
of Alphaeus adopted his children, so that these (cousins of Jesus) 
became brothers of our Savior in the legal sense.” According to 
this view, James, the apostle and brother of the Lord, Gal. 1,19, 
and James, the son of Alphaeus, Matt. 10, 3, are identical. Chem¬ 
nitz (Jerome): Mariam post partum (Matt. 1,25) aut cum Ioseph 
concubuisse aut filios ex ipso sustulisse non credimus, quia non 
legimus, sc. in Scriptura Sacra. The term first-born (Luke 2, 7) 
does not prove that Mary had other sons. 

b. The circumcision, education, and life of Christ. As all 
Jewish male infants were circumcised on the eighth day, so Jesus 



294 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


was made subject to the divine Law by circumcision on the eighth 
day, Luke 2, 21, although He was the Lord of the Law, Matt. 
12, 8; Mark 2, 28. Hence the circumcision of Christ is rightly 
regarded as a part of His redemptive work. 

Though Jesus had no faults that required correction by edu¬ 
cation, but was rather a pattern of virtue even in His childhood, 
Luke 2, 51. 52, since He was “holy, harmless, undefiled, and sepa¬ 
rate from sinners/’ Heb. 7, 26, He nevertheless by real study in¬ 
creased in wisdom according to the natural knowledge of His 
human nature (secundum scientiam naturalem et experimentalem), 
because in His state of humiliation He did not always and fully 
use the divine omniscience communicated to His human nature, 
Phil. 2, 6. 7. 

In His visible sojourn on earth Christ appeared in the form 
of a servant and the likeness of man, enduring all troubles, dangers, 
temptations, reproaches, and hardships that are common to men 
in general. Matt. 8, 20. He also voluntarily subjected Himself to 
the civil government, Matt. 17, 27, and appeared ordinarily as 
a mere man, so that He was regarded as equal or inferior to others. 
Matt. 9,14; 16,13.14. 

c. The suffering , death , and burial of Christ. The suffering 
of Christ extended throughout the days of His visible sojourn on 
earth, Matt. 2,13; Luke 2, Iff., but culminated in the passio magna 
during the last two days of His earthly life. 

The passio magna is the extreme anguish which our Redeemer 
suffered from Gethsemane to Calvary, partly in His soul, partly in 
His body, by enduring to the end the most extreme and bitter 
sorrows for the atonement of our sins, Is. 53, 4—6; 2 Cor. 5, 21. 

The agony of being forsaken by God, Matt. 27,46, was the 
endurance of divine wrath on account of the sins of men in His 
soul, just as if He Himself had committed the imputed trans¬ 
gressions. Or we may say, it was the endurance of the pangs of 
hell (dolores infemales), which consist essentially in separation 
from God, Matt. 8,12; 25, 41; 2 Thess. 1,9. 

Our dogmaticians aptly describe the agony of the desertio as 
the sensus irae divinae propter peccata hominum imputata. But 
it is unscriptural to ascribe to Christ despair (desperatio) in His 
extreme anguish, since despair is wickedness and therefore not in 
agreement with His sinless character, Ps. 22, 2.19; Luke 23,46; 
Gal. 4,4. 5. 

The death of Christ was a true death, or the separation of His 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


295 


soul from His body, Matt. 27, 50; Mark 15, 37; Luke 23, 46; 
John 19,30. In Christ’s death not only His soul, but also His 
body remained in communion with the divine nature (unto per¬ 
sonalis), so that His death was truly that of the Son of God, 
Acts 3,15. The possibility of Christ’s death under these circum¬ 
stances is a mystery so great that He Himself has explained it, 
John 10,17.18. He could die because He did not always and fully 
use the divine majesty imparted to His human nature. 

The honorable burial of Christ and the preservation of His 
body in the grave Scripture presents as a special prerogative of 
the Messiah, Is. 53, 9; Ps. 16, 10; Acts 2, 31; 13, 35—37, who 
after the completion of His redemptive work, Is. 53,10—12, was to 
be highly exalted over all things, Phil. 2, 9—11; Eph. 1, 20—23. 

Scholastic theologians raised the question whether Christ 
might be called a true man also while His body was resting in 
the grave. Quenstedt rightly designates this a questio curiosa, 
based upon a false definition of a human being (ens vivum, animal). 
Scripture clearly affirms that Christ gave Himself for us as a true 
man, 1 Tim. 2, 5. 6, which includes that He was a true man also 
in death. 

4. THE STATE OF EXALTATION. 

Christ’s state of exaltation began with His return to life in 
the grave and exhibited itself to the lower world by His descent 
into hell, to the world by His glorious resurrection, and to the 
highest heavens by His ascension and session at the right hand 
of God the Father. 

Our dogmaticians define the state of exaltation as "the state 
of Christ, the God-man, in which He, according to His human 
nature, having laid aside the infirmities of the flesh, received and 
assumed the plenary exercise of the divine majesty” (Baier). 

The doctrine of Christ’s exaltation is clearly taught in Phil. 
2,9—11; Eph. 1, 20—23; 4,10; etc. Th & Formula of Concord 
expressly rejects the error (kenosis) that Christ was exalted accord¬ 
ing to His divine nature. It declares: "[We reject and condemn] 
when it is taught . . . that all power in heaven and on earth was 
restored, that is, delivered again, to Christ according to His divine 
nature, at the resurrection and His ascension to heaven, as though 
He had also according to His divinity laid this aside and aban¬ 
doned it in His state of humiliation.” The reason for this rejec¬ 
tion is given in the words: "By this doctrine not only the words 
of the testament of Christ are perverted, but also the way is pre- 



296 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


pared for the accursed Arian heresy, so that finally the eternal 
deity of Christ is denied and thus Christ, and with Him our sal¬ 
vation, is entirely lost, if this false doctrine were not firmly con¬ 
tradicted from the immovable foundation of the divine Word and 
our simple Christian [catholic] faith.” (Art. VIII, Epit., 39.) 

As Christ’s humiliation, so also His exaltation took place for 
our salvation, so that in the doctrine of the two states the entire 
Gospel of reconciliation is wrapped up, Rom. 4, 25; 2 Cor. 5, 
18—21. Our Christian faith rests upon both the crucified and the 
glorified Christ, 1 Cor. 15,1—23; Rom. 4, 25. 

5. THE SEVERAL STAGES OF CHRIST’S EXALTATION. 

a. The descent of Christ into hell (descensus ad inferos). The 
doctrine of Christ’s descent into hell rests upon 1 Pet. 3,18—20, 
which describes in detail both its nature and purpose. Additional 
light is shed upon the doctrine by Col. 2,15. According to 1 Pet. 
3,18 the descensus ad inferos consisted in the glorious act of the 
quickened Christ (CcoonotrideL;), by which He, with soul and body 
(against the papists and modern theologians), according to His 
human nature, went (jiogev&ds) to the prison (<pvlaxfj) of the evil 
spirits and the damned (dnet&rjoaoiv) and preached (lxrjgv£ev} 
to them. The Greek verb xrjgvooeiv does not necessarily mean to 
“announce salvation,” but is a vox media, which stands for both 
Law- and Gospel-preaching; in itself it does not mean more than 
to proclaim, to announce, to publish. It is used for the preach¬ 
ing of the Law in Matt. 3,1; Acts 15, 21; Rom. 2, 21; Rev. 5, 2 ' r 
Luke 12, 3. In 1 Pet. 3,19, as the context shows, the term mani¬ 
festly denotes Law-preaching, since Christ here came as a “Herald” - 
(xfjgvk ) to bring the proclamation of His victory to such as had 
heard the divine Word on earth, yet had refused to accept it 
(dnei^oaotv). To them Christ therefore appeared as the divine 
Judge, whose authority they had scorned on earth. That this is 
the meaning of Christ’s appearance in hell is proved by the very 
scope of the text; for in the preceding verses the Christians are 
exhorted to bear suffering at the hand of the ungodly, trusting in 
the righteous Judge, who will mete out due punishment to all 
enemies of His Church at His second advent. 

The descent of Christ into hell foreshadowed the final judg¬ 
ment of the wicked; and it is for this reason that St. Peter refers 
to it in this passage. 

Hollaz is right when he says: “Christ descended into hell, not 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


297 


for the purpose of suffering any evil from the demons, John 19, 30; 
Luke 24, 26, but to triumph over the devils, Rev. 1,18; Col. 2,16, 
and to convince condemned men that they were justly shut up in 
the infernal prison, 1 Pet. 3,19. The preaching of Christ in hell 
was not evangelical, but legal, accusatory, terrifying, and that, too, 
both verbal, by which He convinced them that they had deserved 
eternal punishments, and real, by which He struck frightful terror 
into them.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 396.) 

In opposition to various errorists we hold that it was not the 
purpose of Christ in descending to hell — 

a) To preach the Gospel to the evil spirits and their captives 
(Origen, all teachers of a complete restoration, or apokatastasis), 
or at least to those of the damned who in their earthly life did not 
have the opportunity to hear the Gospel (Church Fathers, modern 
theologians). The statement in 1 Pet. 4, 6 that “the Gospel was 
preached also to them that are dead” does not refer to Christ’s 
preaching in hell, but to the preaching of the Gospel to men while 
they were still living on earth. This follows from the clause of 
purpose, “that they might be judged according to men in the flesh.” 
At any rate, the passage does not teach a probation after death. 

b) To suffer the pangs of hell (Aepinus, Flacius) or to pay 
to Satan, as the keeper of the prison, a ransom for the redeemed 
souls (Origen). For neither was Christ’s descent a part of His 
humiliation, Luke 23, 43—46, nor did Satan have any authority to 
triumph over man and to hold him captive, 1 John 3, 8; Heb. 
2, 14. 15. The passage Acts 2, 24 must not be construed as 
teaching any suffering of Christ after death; for the expression 
“pains of death” is equivalent to “power of death,” as the context 
clearly shows. 

Against John Parsimonius, who, on the ground that hell is no 
locality, held that Christ “descended into hell” only in the sense 
that during His lifetime He suffered the pains of hell, our dogma- 
ticians declared that Scripture teaches us to believe that our Savior 
descended into hell truly and really, though not by any local move¬ 
ment, since the quickened Christ was no longer in the form of 
a servant, but in the form of God, and so constantly employed the 
divine majesty communicated to His human nature. 

As John Parsimonius, so also the Reformed deny Christ’s real 
descent into hell, some referring the descensus to the entire state 
of humiliation (Sohnius), others to His burial (Bucer, Beza), and 
still others to the pains which He suffered in His soul during His 



298 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


great Passion (Calvin). In the Lutheran Church the doctrine of 
Christ’s descent into hell was definitely fixed on the basis of Scrip¬ 
ture by the adoption of Article IX of the Formula of Concord. 
Hollaz defines the descensus ad inferos thus: “The descent of 
Christ into the lower world is the true, real, and supernatural 
movement by which Christ, having been freed from the chains of 
death and restored to life, in His entire person betook Himself to 
the lower regions that He might exhibit Himself to the evil spirits 
and to condemned men as the Conqueror of death.” ( Doctr. Theol., 
p. 379.) 

b. The resurrection of Christ. The resurrection of Christ has 
been defined by Hollaz as “the act of glorious victory by which 
Christ, the God-man, through the same power as that of God the 
Father and the Holy Spirit, brought forth His body, reunited with 
the soul and glorified, and showed it alive to His disciples by 
various proofs, for the confirmation of our peace, fellowship, joy, 
and hope in our own future resurrection.” {Doctr. Theol., p. 380.) 
This definition is both Scriptural and complete. 

According to Scripture the resurrection of Christ, on the one 
hand, was the work of God the Father, who acted as its efficient 
Cause, Eph. 1, 20; Rom. 6, 4. As such our Savior’s resurrection 
was the actual absolution, or justification, of the whole world; for 
by the resurrection, or justification, of the divine Substitute of 
man God declared all sinners free from sin, Rom. 4, 24. 25; 10, 9. 
For this reason Christ’s resurrection is the object of justifying 
faith, 1 Cor. 15,14.17. 21. Calov writes of this: “As God pun¬ 
ished our sins in Christ, which were placed upon, and imputed to, 
Him as our Substitute, so also by raising Him from the dead He 
absolved Him from our sins imputed to Him and therefore also 
absolved us in Him.” ( Biblia Ittustr., ad Rom. 4, 25.) 

On the other hand, Scripture describes also Christ Himself as 
the efficient Cause (causa efficiens) of His resurrection, John 2,19; 
10, 17. 18, inasmuch as He is true God and in possession of the 
same divine power (una numero omnipotentia) as the Father and 
the Holy Ghost, John 5, 19. From this point of view Christ’s 
resurrection is a most powerful proof for His deity and divine 
Saviorship, John 2,18—21. 

The body of Christ which, reunited with the soul, came forth 
from the grave was the same body which the Son of God assumed 
in the body of Mary and which He subjected to suffering and death, 
John 20, 27. But the risen body of Christ possessed new properties 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


299 


(idem corpus essentia, novum qualitatibus). The natural body 
(od>pa yvxtxov, 1 Cor. 15,44) had become a spiritual body (pd>pa 
nvevpauxov, 1 Cor. 15, 44), that is, a glorified body (ad)pa tt}s 
dot-r)<;, Phil. 3, 21). 

The resurrection of Christ occurred clauso sepulchro, or 
through the closed and sealed tomb, Matt. 28,1—6. This truth 
is denied by the Reformed theologians because they reject the com¬ 
munication of attributes, John 20,19. 

The eating of the food by the risen Savior, Luke 24, 43, oc¬ 
curred not from necessity, but from free will; not for the nourish¬ 
ment of His body, but for the strengthening of the faith of the 
disciples. 

With regard to the purpose of the resurrection, Hollaz says 
correctly that Christ rose again in order to manifest the victory 
which He had obtained over death and the devil, Acts 2, 24; Heb. 
2,14.15, and to offer and apply to all men the fruits of His Passion 
and death, Rom. 4, 25; 1 Pet. 1, 3. 4; John 11, 25. 26; 14, 19; 
2 Cor. 4, 14; 1 Thess. 4, 14; Rom. 6, 4; 2 Cor. 5, 15. For this 
reason the doctrine of Christ’s resurrection is fundamental for the 
entire Christian religion. 

c. The forty days between Christ’s resurrection and ascension. 
The information which Holy Scripture gives with regard to the 
forty days between Christ’s resurrection and ascension is only 
fragmentary. After His triumphant victory over death our Savior 
no longer associated with His disciples as He did in the days of His 
flesh, Luke 24, 44, yet He continually appeared to them, Acts 1, 3; 
1 Cor. 15, 4—8, conversed and ate with them, Luke 24, 41—43, and 
convinced them that He was the Christ, the Son of God, John 20, 
19—31. 

d. The ascension of Christ. Christ’s ascension may be viewed 
either in a wider sense, including His sitting at the right hand of 
God, Acts 2, 33. 34; Eph. 4,10, or in a narrower sense, embracing 
only the visible elevation of Christ on high, Luke 24, 51; Acts 1, 
9—11. In this article we use the term in the latter signification. 

In contradistinction to the resurrection the ascension occurred 
before witnesses. Acts 1, 9—14. Essentially it consisted in a local 
movement upward (motus localis), until the Savior was received 
by a cloud, Acts 1, 9. 

The heaven into which Christ ascended is not only the heaven 
of the blessed saints (John 14, 2: domicilium beatorum ascensionis 
terminus ad quern proprius), but also the right hand of God 



300 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


(coelum maiestaticum). God’s right hand is not a definite place, 
but His omnipotent power, which fills heaven and earth, Matt. 
26,64; Ex. 15, 6; Heb. 1, 3; 8,1; 12,2; Ps. 139,10; Eph. 1, 
20—23. 

The purpose of the ascension was, a) with respect to Christ 
Himself, His public and triumphant certification as the Savior of 
the world, or His solemn enthronement according to His human 
nature, John 6, 60—62, and, b) with respect to all believers, the 
most glorious assurance that they, too, shall follow Christ into 
heaven, John 14, 2f.; 17,24. 

The Reformed regard heaven as created space, in which 
Christ’s human nature is enclosed (Christus comprehensus et cir- 
cumscriptus), so that, according to His human nature, He is 
present neither in the Lord’s Supper nor anywhere else outside the 
heavenly place in which His human nature is shut in. Acts 3, 21 
does not prove the error of the Reformed. (Cf. Formula of Con- 
cord, Thor. Decl., VII, 119.) 

Hollaz gives the following comprehensive definition of Christ’s 
ascension: “The ascension is the glorious act of Christ by which, 
after having been resuscitated. He betook Himself, according to 
His human nature, by a true, real, and local motion, according to 
His voluntary determination (per liberam oeconomiam) and in 
a visible manner unto the clouds and thence in an invisible manner 
into the common heaven of the blessed and to the very throne of 
God, that, having triumphed over His enemies, He might occupy 
the kingdom of God, Acts 3, 21, reopen the closed paradise. Rev. 
3, 7, and prepare a permanent inheritance for us in heaven, John 
14, 2.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 380.) 

e. Christ’s sitting at the right hand of Ood. Since the right 
hand of God is His omnipresent power and operation, Ps. 139, 
9. 10; 118, 15. 16, Christ’s sitting at the right hand of God the 
Father is His full and incessant use of the divine majesty com¬ 
municated to the human nature for universal and most glorious 
government in the kingdoms of power, grace, and glory, 1 Cor. 15, 
25. 27; Ps. 110,1; Heb. 2, 7. 8. Christ’s session at the right hand 
of God is therefore His exaltation, according to His human nature, 
to the sovereign lordship and rule over all things, Eph. 1, 20—23; 
4,10; 1 Pet. 3, 22; Acts 3,21. (Cp. Formula of Concord, Thor. 
Decl., VIII, 27.) 

Concerning the participation of the human nature in the om¬ 
nipotent operation of the divine nature in the states of humili- 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


301 


ation and exaltation, we may note the following: As the divine 
majesty (<3o£a) was always in the human nature after the incarna¬ 
tion, John 1, 14; Col. 2, 9, yet revealed itself in a peculiar way 
through the human nature at the transfiguration, Matt. 17,1—8, 
so also the omnipotent operation of the divine nature was always 
in the human nature after the incarnation, yet revealed itself most 
gloriously after its exaltation to the right hand of God. 

The sitting of Christ at the Tight hand of God may be defined 
in all its aspects as “the highest degree of glory, in which Christ, 
the God-man, having been exalted as to His human nature to the 
throne of divine majesty, most powerfully and by His immediate 
presence governs all things which are in the kingdoms of power, 
grace, and glory for the praise of His own name and the solace 
and safety of the afflicted Church.” (Hollaz, Doctr. Theol., p. 381.) 

The special comfort for the believer which attaches to Christ’s 
triumphant session at the right hand of God is beautifully expressed 
by the Formula of Concord in the following words (Thor. Decl., 
VII, 78 f.) : “We hold . . . that also according to His assumed 
nature and with the same He [Christ] can be, and also is, present 
where He will, and especially that in His Church and congregation 
on earth He is present as Mediator, Head, King, and High Priest, 
not in part, or one half of Him only, but the entire person of 
Christ is present, to which both natures belong, the divine and the 
human; not only according to His divinity, but also according to 
and with His assumed human nature, according to which He is our 
Brother and we are flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone, even as 
He has instituted His Holy Supper for the certain assurance and 
confirmation of this, that also according to that nature according 
to which He has flesh and blood He will be with us and dwell, work, 
and be efficacious in us.” 

f. Christ’s second advent. The doctrine of Christ’s visible and 
glorious return for the final Judgment will be considered under the 
head of Eschatology, where it properly belongs. 

C. The Doctrine of Christ’s Office. 

(De Opere sive Officio Christ!.) 

The incarnation of the Son of God took place in order that 
the work of redemption, decreed by God from eternity, might be 
accomplished, John 17, 4; 3, 16; Matt. 18, 11; Luke 19, 10; 
1 Tim. 1,15. The Augsburg Confession declares (Art. Ill): “The 
Word, that is, the Son of God, did assume the human nature in 



302 


THE DOCTRINE OP CHRIST. 


the womb of the blessed Virgin Mary . . . that He might reconcile 
the Father unto us and to be a Sacrifice, not only for original 
guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.” Hence, whatever Christ 
in His state of humiliation did as the God-man, Luke 1, 30. 31; 
Matt. 1, 21. 25; Luke 2,21, and what He still does as such in His 
state of exaltation belongs to His divine office, or work. 

Of the mediatorial office of Christ Quenstedt writes: “The 
mediatorial office is the function, belonging to the whole person of 
the God-man and consisting of theanthropic actions, by which 
function Christ in, with, and through both natures perfectly exe¬ 
cuted, by way of acquisition and application, and is even now 
executing, all things that are necessary for our salvation.” ( Doctr . 
Theol., p. 338.) More briefly expressed, Christ’s mediatorial work 
embraces all that He did to effect our salvation and all that He still 
does to make salvation available to men. 

If the question is asked, Since when did Christ execute His 
mediatorial office? we reply: a) Not only since the time of His 
baptism, which was indeed the solemn induction into His public 
mediatorial ministry, but b) from the very moment of His incarna¬ 
tion, since His conception, birth, circumcision, filial obedience, etc., 
were accomplished for the salvation of sinful and lost mankind. 
Gal. 4, 4. 5; 1 John 3, 8. 

Those who assume that the Son of God became incarnate for 
reasons other than the redemption of mankind (Socinians, Pela¬ 
gians, Schleiermacher, modern theologians: “Christ came as the 
second Adam to perfect creation”) oppose Scripture, which ex¬ 
pressly teaches that Christ came into the world only to save sinners, 
John 3,16; 1 Tim. 1,15; 1 John 4, 9. 10. 

If it is asked why the Xoyog waited four thousand years before 
He became incarnate, we have no other answer in Scripture than 
that it so pleased God, Gal. 4, 4. 5. 

As the Savior of sinful mankind, Christ had to accomplish 
three distinct works: a) He had to teach men the way of sal¬ 
vation, Luke 4, 18; John 1, 18; Heb. 1, 1; Matt. 17, 5. b) He 
had to reconcile the world unto God, 2 Cor. 5,18. 19; Matt. 20, 28; 
Rom. 5,10; 1 John 2, 2. c) He had to rule over the Church as its 
Head and over all things as the sovereign King of the universe, 
Luke 1, 33; Eph. 1, 20—23; John 18, 33—37. Hence we speak of 
the threefold office of Christ: a) the prophetic (munus prophe- 
ticum), b) the sacerdotal (munus sacerdotale), and c) the kingly 
(munus regium). As the divine Prophet, Priest, and King the 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


303 


Messiah was pictured already in the Old Testament, Deut. 18, 
15—19; Ps. 110; 2,6—12. 

All actions performed by Christ, our Prophet, Priest, and 
King, are theanthropic actions; in other words, all things necessary 
for our salvation axe executed by Christ according to both natures. 

While the three offices were never divided, or separated, in 
Christ, we hold to the classification just given (munus triplex) for 
the sake of greater clearness in presenting Christ’s work, though 
some dogmaticians combine the prophetic office with the sacerdotal, 
obtaining in this way only two offices of Christ. 

A. THE PROPHETIC OFFICE OF CHRIST. 

(De Munere Prophetico.) 

1. THE EXECUTION OF THIS OFFICE IN THE STATE 
OF HUMILIATION. 

In His state of humiliation Christ did not teach as did the 
prophets of Israel, but as the unique Prophet sent by God ( Propheta 
xat’ l£oxijv, Propheta omnibus excellentior , Luke 7, 16; John 
4,19; 6,14, that is to say, immediately (avtongoownwg) and by 
His own authority, John 7, 46; 1,18. Our Lord did not receive His 
divine doctrines by divine inspiration, 2 Pet. 1, 21, but possessed 
them as the omniscient Son of God, Matt. 23, 8.10; Luke 24,19; 
4, 32; Matt. 7, 29; John 6, 63. Nor did He possess His divine 
knowledge merely according to His divine nature; for through 
the personal union (communication of attributes) also His human 
nature participated in the omniscience of His divine nature, Col. 
2, 3. 9. (In Christo igitur Deus ipse munere prophetico futigitur, 
Heb. 1, 2.) Augustine: Doctor doctorum Christus, cuius schola 
in terra et cathedra in coelo est.” 

With respect to the message which Christ proclaimed. Scrip¬ 
ture declares very plainly that He announced Himself as the divine 
Savior from sin, death, and the power of the devil, Matt. 4,17; 
John 6, 40; 3, 14. 15; Matt. 20, 28; John 6, 51—65. As Paul 
preached Christ and Him Crucified as his central message, 1 Cor. 
2, 2; 2 Cor. 4, 5, so our divine Savior centered His entire preach¬ 
ing in the astounding Gospel-truth of salvation through His vica¬ 
rious death, Luke 18, 31—34; Matt. 16, 21—23; Mark 8, 27—33. 
Again, as St. Paul proclaimed salvation by grace through faith in 
the crucified and risen Christ, so also Christ Himself published the 
Gospel of salvation by grace through faith in Him, Matt. 11, 28; 
John 6, 29. 32. 33. 35. 



804 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


It is true, our divine Lord, as the Prophet whom God raised 
up like unto Moses, Deut. 18,15, promulgated also the divine Law, 
Matt. 5—7, not, however, a new law (Modernists), but the same 
Moral Law which God had published in the Old Testament, Matt. 
22, 34—40, the fulfilling of which is love, Eom. 13,10. Even the 
Sermon on the Mount, Matt. 5—7, was not a new law, but only the 
right explanation of the Moral Law in opposition to the false inter¬ 
pretations of the scribes. The commandment of love was taught 
so explicitly in the Old Testament, Lev. 19,18, that the Jews at the 
time of Christ fully understood it, Luke 10, 27. The “new com¬ 
mandment,” John 13, 34, was new only with regard to its peculiar 
application to Christ’s followers and the motives with which it was 
enforced (Luther: “new through the new spiritual powers”); for 
His disciples were to love one another in imitation of their divine 
Master, in whom they believed. 

In opposition to all errorists who affirm that Christ was essen¬ 
tially a new Lawgiver (Pelagians, Arminians, Semi-Pelagians, 
Modernists, papists: Christ proclaimed as a new law the evan¬ 
gelical counsels, consilia evangelica: chastity, poverty, and obe¬ 
dience) the Church declares on the basis of Scripture: “Christ 
was indeed a Teacher of the Law, but not a new Lawgiver.” 
(Christus quidem fuit legis doctor, sed non novus legislator.) Yet, 
though Christ preached also the divine Law, the administration of 
His prophetic office consisted properly in His proclamation of the 
Gospel of salvation through faith in His atoning suffering and 
death, John 1,17. 

2. THE EXECUTION OF THE PROPHETIC OFFICE IN THE 
STATE OF EXALTATION. 

In His state of exaltation Christ no longer proclaims the 
Gospel immediately (avTongooconcog), but mediately, through the 
ministerial work of the Church, John 20, 21; Matt. 28, 19. 20; 
Mark 16,15.16; 2 Cor. 13, 2. 3; 2 Tim. 1, 9—11. Nevertheless 
also in His state of exaltation He remains the true Prophet and 
Teacher of His Church, Col. 3, 16; Eph. 4, 10—12, so that His 
Word alone should be preached to men, John 8, 31. 32; 1 Pet. 
4,11; 1 Tim. 6, 3—5. All who preach their own wisdom in place 
of God’s Word are not Christian ministers, but false prophets 
(dvzixQiozoi), whom believers should avoid, Matt. 15, 7—9; 7,16; 
Eom. 16,17.18; 1 John 2,18. Dr. A. Strong rightly says: “All 
modern prophecy that is true is but the republication of Christ’s 
message, the proclamation and expounding of truth already re- 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


305 


vealed in Scripture.” ( Syst . Theol., p. 389.) Of all false prophets 
the Pope at Rome is the most insidious and pernicious, since he 
perverts the Word of God and opposes the prophetic office of Christ 
under the pretense that he is the viceregent and vicar of the ex¬ 
alted Lord. For this reason he is the Antichrist {dvriygiaxog xat’ 
0-oxrjv), 2 Thess. 2, 3ff. 

Also in the Old Testament the Son of God, or the preexistent 
Aoyog, was the true Teacher and Prophet of the Church; for it was 
He who conversed with the saints of old and revealed to them the 
truth of salvation. This important fact Scripture teaches by de¬ 
claring a) that it was the Spirit of Christ that inspired the prophets 
who prophesied of the grace that should come, 1 Pet. 1, 10—12, 
and b) that it was the Son of God who revealed to Israel the saving 
truths of God, John 12,41; cp. Is. 6,1 f.; 1 Cor. 10, 4. Luther: 
“Almost in all places in the Old Testament Christ is revealed to 
us under the name of God.” (St. L., II, 853.) 

B. THE SACERDOTAL OFFICE OF CHRIST. 

(De Munere Sacerdotali.) 

The grace of God which Christ proclaimed as the divine 
Prophet He Himself secured as the divine Priest of men. Hence 
those who deny, or pervert the Biblical doctrine of, the sacerdotal 
office of our Savior, must deny and pervert also His prophetic office. 
Rationalists of every type who reject the vicarious atonement of 
Christ (satisfactio vicaria) cannot regard Him as the true Prophet 
of grace and forgiveness, but must consider Him merely a Teacher 
of morality, who came into the world to induce men to secure sal¬ 
vation by their own works and righteousness. In short, if Christ 
is not the divine Priest, neither is He the divine Prophet in the 
Biblical sense. 

The sacerdotal office of Christ, who is called Priest ins, 
legevg /ueyag , dgyiegevg) both in the Old and in the New Testa¬ 
ment (Ps.110,4; Zech.6,13; Heb.5,6; 8,4; 10,21; etc.), is 
that work of the God-man by which He reconciled the world unto 
God, 2 Cor. 5, 19. Holy Scripture describes both the manner 
(modus reconciliationis) and the means (medium reconciliationis) 
by which this gracious work was accomplished. Its consistent testi¬ 
mony is that Christ offered Himself, or laid down His life, as 
a ransom for the sins of the world, John 17, 19; 1 Tim. 2, 6; 
1 John 2,2; John 1,29. 

To the sacerdotal office of Christ belongs also His intercession, 

20 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 


300 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


which will be considered later. A complete definition of Christ's 
sacerdotal office is given by Quenstedt, who writes: “The priestly 
office of Christ is composed of two parts, satisfaction and inter¬ 
cession. For, in the first place. He made an absolutely perfect 
satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world and earned salvation. 
In the second place, He anxiously interceded, and still intercedes 
and mediates, on behalf of all, for the application of the acquired 
salvation. That the Messiah would perform these functions of 
a priest is clearly predicted, Is. 53,12.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 347.) 

In particular, the purchase-price for our sins ( pretium , Avzgov) 
was Christ’s blood shed on Calvary, 1 John 1, 7; Heb. 10, 29; 
13, 20. Of this Luther writes: “The blood which flowed from the 
side of our Lord Jesus is the treasure of our redemption, the pay¬ 
ment and atonement for our sins. For through His innocent suf¬ 
fering and death and through His holy and precious blood, shed 
upon the cross, our dear Lord Jesus Christ paid our entire debt 
of eternal death and damnation, in which we all are because of 
our sins. The same blood of Christ intercedes for us before God 
and cries to God without ceasing: Grace ! Grace ! Forgive ! Forgive 1 
Indulgence! Indulgence ! Father! Father! and secures for us divine 
grace, forgiveness of sins, righteousness, and salvation. Thus the 
blood of Jesus Christ, our only Mediator and Advocate, cries for¬ 
ever and ever without ceasing, so that God the Father regards 
such crying and interceding of His beloved Son and is gracious ta 
us poor, miserable sinners, Zech. 9, 11.” (Expl. of John 19, 34; 
St. L., VIII, 965 ff.) 

In the Old Testament the priests offered lambs and goats for 
the sins of the people, Heb. 10, 4; Christ, however, the great High 
Priest, Heb. 7, 26. 27, sacrificed Himself, He being both Priest and 
Sacrifice in one person, Heb. 9, 12—14; Eph. 5, 2. (Christus 
semetipsum sacrificavit.) This is the golden theme of the whole 
Bible: the astounding message of reconciliation (IXaapog) through 
the holy blood of the divine Victim Jesus Christ, Acts 10, 43; Luke- 
24, 25—27. 

Christ executed His sacerdotal office by rendering perfect obe¬ 
dience to His Father, who out of pure love offered up His only- 
begotten Son for the redemption of the world, John 3,16; 1,29. 
Scripture accordingly describes Christ’s redemptive work as obe¬ 
dience to God ( obedientia ). The vicarious obedience of Christ 
comprises: a) His active obedience (obedientia activa), by which 
our divine Substitute placed Himself under the obligation of the- 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


307 


divine Law, fulfilling it in our stead by His perfectly holy life. 
Gal. 4, 4. 5; Rom. 5,19; Matt. 3,15, and b) His passive obedience 
(obedieniia passiva), by which He placed Himself under the curse 
of the Law and suffered and died for the sins of the world, Heb. 
9,12; Eph. 5, 2; Is. 53, 4—6. Thus by His holy life and His 
innocent death Christ secured for us that divine merit (meritum 
Christi) which is our righteousness before God unto salvation, 
Rom. 3, 22—25; 2 Cor. 5,19—21. 

The prepositions dvzi, vnig (Matt. 20, 28; 2 Cor. 5, 14), 
translated in our Authorized Version with “for,” do not merely 
mean “for the benefit of,” but rather: “in place of.” They express 
the fact that Christ suffered and died in our stead, or as our true 
Substitute. Luther rightly says: “Christ suffered death, maledic¬ 
tion, and damnation, just as if He Himself had broken the whole 
Law and deserved every sentence pronounced by the Law on 
criminals.” (St. L., XII, 236.) 

Since Christ by His most perfect obedience has paid the 
penalty of our sin and expiated our guilt, He has freed us also 
from the dreadful consequences which sin, both original and actual, 
has brought upon us, such as a) death, 2 Tim. 1,10; b) the power 
of the devil, Heb. 2,14; c) the dominion of sin, Titus 2,14; etc. 
All these infinite spiritual blessings are comprised in the expression 
“the redemption of the human race,” which Hollaz defines as “the 
spiritual, judicial, and most costly deliverance of all men, bound 
in the chains of sin, from guilt, from the wrath of God, and from 
temporal and eternal punishment, accomplished by Christ, the God- 
man, through His active and passive obedience, which God, the 
most righteous Judge, graciously received as a most perfect ransom 
(Avtpov), so that the human race, introduced into spiritual liberty, 
may live forever with God.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 346.) 

Objections to the Scriptural doctrine of the redemption of lost 
mankind through the perfect obedience of Christ (active and pas¬ 
sive) have always been raised by the proud, self-righteous carnal 
heart of man, 1 Cor. 1, 23. While some critics denied the necessity 
and validity of Christ’s active obedience (“As a man Christ obeyed 
the divine Law for His own good”; Anselm, Aepinus), others 
violently attacked the necessity and validity of His passive obe¬ 
dience (Rationalism, Unitarianism, Modernism). In the interest 
of denying Christ’s vicarious satisfaction it has been claimed: 
a) that the term redemption ( dnoXvxgcoat;) means simply liberation 
and not the purchasing of sinners by the payment of an adequate 



308 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


ransom; b) that the idea of satisfaction conflicts with the gratu¬ 
itous remission of sins; c) that God cannot transfer the crime 
of one to another and punish an innocent Substitute for guilty 
man, etc. 

All these objections contradict the clear doctrines of Scripture, 
which teaches: a) that Christ's redemption was indeed effected 
by the payment of the price of His blood, 1 Cor. 6, 20; 1 Pet. 1, 
18.19; Gal. 3,13; Eph. 1, 7; Titus 2,14; Heb. 9,12.15; Rev. 
5,9; b) that the mercy of God in remitting sin is indeed gratu¬ 
itous in the sense that no satisfaction is required of us; but it is 
not gratuitous absolutely , since it required the satisfaction of 
Christ, Rom. 3, 24; Eph. 1, 7; and c) that God indeed transferred 
the sins of man upon Christ and punished Him in our stead, 
Is. 53, 4—6; John 1, 29; Gal. 3,13. 

Gerhard very exhaustively classifies the Scriptural statements 
which describe Christ’s sacerdotal work and in particular His vica¬ 
rious satisfaction as follows: a) Christ is our Mediator, 1 Tim. 
2, 5; Heb. 8, 6; 9,15; 12, 24; b) Christ is our Redeemer, Is. 53, 
4—6; Luke 1, 68; Rom. 3, 24; 1 Cor. 1, 30; Eph. 1, 7; Col. 
1,14; 1 Tim. 2, 6; Heb. 9,12.15; c) Christ is the Propitiation 
( IXaofxog ) for our sins, 1 John 2, 2; 4,10; Rom. 3, 24. 25; d) by 
Him we are reconciled to God, Rom. 5, 10. 11; 2 Cor. 5, 18. 19; 
Eph. 2, 16; Col. 1, 20; e) Christ gave His life as kvjQov xal 
d.vxikvxQov for us, Matt. 20, 28; Mark 10, 45; Titus 2,14; 1 Pet. 
1,18.19; Heb. 9,15; f) Christ was made sin for us, 2 Cor. 5, 21; 
Rom. 8, 3; g) Christ became a curse for us, Gal. 3,13; h) Christ 
took upon Himself our sins and their punishment. Is. 53, 4—6; 
John 1,29; 1 Pet. 2, 24; i) Christ shed His blood for our sins, 
Matt. 26, 28; 1 John 1,7; Heb. 9,12; j) Christ blotted out the 
indictment against us. Col. 2,14; k) Christ freed us from the curse 
of the Law, Gal. 3,13; 4, 5; 1) Christ freed us from the wrath of 
God, 1 Thess. 1,10; m) Christ freed us from eternal condemna¬ 
tion, 1 Thess. 5, 9.10; n) in Christ we are righteous and beloved, 
2 Cor. 5, 21. ( Doctr.Theol p.357.) 

Hence, if any one denies the vicarious satisfaction which 
Christ, as the divinely appointed High Priest, made for the sins 
of the world, he denies the very heart of the Biblical message of 
redemption. Remove from the Bible the atoning work of Christ, 
and nothing of the Gospel is left. It is for this reason that Christ’s 
sacerdotal office constitutes the very core of Christian theology. 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


309 


1. THE VICARIOUS ATONEMENT. 

(Satisfactio Vicaria.) 

The Scriptural doctrine of Christ’s redemption made for all 
men is known in ecclesiastical terminology as His vicarious satis¬ 
faction (satisfactio vicaria), or vicarious atonement (stellvertre- 
tende Oenugtuung). Synonyms of this term used in Scripture 
are: propitiation (lAaofios, 1 John 2, 2); mercy-seat (iXaoxrjQiov, 
Rom. 3, 25); reconciliation (xaxaAAayrj, Rom. 6,10; 2 Cor. 5,18) ; 
redemption (dnoXvxQcooie, Eph. 1, 7; Col. 1,14) ; ransom (Xvxgov, 
Matt. 20, 28), all of which declare that the redemption of Christ 
was made by the payment of an adequate price for the captives. 

The term vicarious satisfaction in particular is used to express 
the following truths: a) God, according to His perfect justice 
(iustitia legislatoria, normativa), demands of all men perfect obe¬ 
dience to His Law, and His wrath is upon all (iustitia vindicativa) 
who do not fulfil it, Gal. 3,10; b) Christ, by His perfect (active 
and passive) obedience, has satisfied the demands of divine justice 
in man’s stead. Gal. 4, 4. 5; 3,13; 1 Pet. 3,18, and has thus turned 
the wrath of God into grace, or favor, Rom. 5, 10; c) through 
Christ’s satisfaction all men were reconciled unto God, 2 Cor. 5, 
18—21; that is to say, God is no longer angry with sinners and 
no longer imputes to them their transgressions, but has graciously 
forgiven them all their sins, Rom. 5,10.18.19. 

The Formula of Concord thus emphasizes this comforting doc¬ 
trine: “Since it is the obedience, as above mentioned, ... of the 
entire person, it is a complete satisfaction and expiation for the 
human race, by which the eternal, immutable righteousness of God, 
revealed in the Law, has been satisfied and is thus our righteous¬ 
ness, which avails before God and is revealed in the Gospel and 
upon which faith relies before God, which God imputes to faith, as 
it is written, Rom. 5, 19; 1 John 1, 7; Hab. 2, 4; Rom. 1, 17.” 
(Thor. Decl., Ill, 57.) So also the Apology says: “The Law con¬ 
demns all men; but Christ, because without sin He has borne the 
punishment of sin and has been made a victim for us, has removed 
that right of the Law to accuse and condemn those who believe in 
Him, because He Himself is the Propitiation for them, for whose 
sake we now are accounted righteous. But since they are accounted 
righteous, the Law cannot accuse or condemn them, even though 
they have not actually satisfied the Law.” (Art. Ill, 58.) 



810 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


2. OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE RECONCILIATION. 

(Heconciliatio Oblectiva, Sublectiva.) 

The reconciliation which Christ effected through His vicarious 
suffering and death is fittingly called objective reconciliation. This 
was accomplished over nineteen centuries ago when our divine Sub¬ 
stitute died on Calvary, 2 Cor. 5,18.19; Rom. 5,10. For then the 
demands of divine justice were fully satisfied, God’s wrath was 
turned into grace, and universal pardon was proclaimed to all 
sinners, John 19,30; Rom. 5,16.18.19. Reconciliation (justifi¬ 
cation) was thus secured without any work or merit on the part 
of sinful man, just as creation was accomplished without man’s 
cooperation. Objective reconciliation is therefore not brought about 
through man’s faith, but rather, just because it exists, man can 
now be justified by faith. 

The objective reconciliation which Christ effected through His 
death was publicly proclaimed and offered to the world by God 
through Christ’s glorious resurrection; for this is the actual abso¬ 
lution, or justification, of the whole world, Rom. 4, 25. The ob¬ 
jective reconciliation, or justification, of the whole world is more¬ 
over announced to all sinners in the Gospel, for which reason the 
Gospel is called the Word of Reconciliation (Xoyog zrjg xaxaXlayrjg ), 
2 Cor. 5,19. Luther: “The Gospel is a proclamation of Christ, 
true God and man, who by His death and resurrection has atoned 
for the sins of all men and conquered death and the devil.” (St. L., 
XIV, 88.) 

The objective reconciliation of Christ, or the absolution or 
justification of the whole sinful world, is appropriated by the indi¬ 
vidual believer through faith in the Gospel promises of forgiveness 
and thus becomes subjective reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5, 20. That is to 
say, the individual sinner obtains for himself through faith the 
forgiveness which Christ has secured for all men by His suffering 
and death. Saving, or justifying, faith may therefore be defined 
as a penitent sinner’s personal trust in the reconciliation effected 
for the entire world. Saving faith does not justify inasmuch as 
in itself it reconciles God, but inasmuch as it seizes and obtains 
the reconciliation which already exists and is freely offered in the 
Gospel to all sinners. The Apology says: “Faith properly so called 
is that which assents to the promise (Art. IV [II], 113.) And 
the Formula of Concord: “Faith does not justify because it is so 
good a work, so illustrious a virtue, but because it apprehends and 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


311 


embraces the merits of Christ in the promise of the Gospel.” 
(Thor. Deel., Ill, 13.) 

The distinction between objective and subjective reconciliation 
(justification) must be diligently observed; for all who reject the 
objective reconciliation of Christ cannot teach justification by grace 
through faith without the deeds of the Law. As soon as the Scrip¬ 
tural truth that “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto 
Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them,” 2 Cor. 5,19, is 
denied, the doctrine of salvation by work-righteousness must follow 
(Arminianism, Semi-Pelagianism, Modernism), since in that case 
the sinner must himself reconcile God by his good works. From 
beginning to end the entire comfort of sinners longing for salva¬ 
tion rests upon the objective reconciliation which Christ has made 
on Calvary. Their own subjective reconciliation, or justification, 
is but the blessed fruit of that amazing deed of love. 

3. REJECTION OF ERRORS PERTAINING TO CHRIST’S 
VICARIOUS ATONEMENT. 

The vicarious satisfaction of Christ is repudiated by all who 
deny the condemning wrath of God (iustitia Dei vindicativa); for 
if God had not been angry at man’s sin, there would have been no 
need for the atoning death of our Savior. (Cf. the antichristian 
views of the Unitarians, Modernists, Ritschl, Harnack, etc.) The 
objections of all rationalists to the Gospel fact of redemption (“God 
could forgive sin without the death of Christ by a mere fiat of 
His sovereign will”; “It is an unworthy conception of God to re¬ 
gard Him as so angry over sin that Christ had to die for sinful 
man”; “Christ died merely to reveal God’s love to man”; “It 
would be an act of injustice for God to punish the sinless Savior 
for sinful man”; “The idea of God’s reconciliation through Christ’s 
vicarious atonement is unethical or too juridical”) are all refuted 
by passages of Scripture which affirm the very truths that are 
denied by these objectors on rationalistic grounds. Is. 53, 4—6; 
2 Cor. 5, 18—21. Among the errors by which Christ’s vicarious 
atonement is rejected, either in its entirety or in part, we enumerate 
the following: — 

a. The error of acceptilation (acceptilatio). Christ’s vicarious 
satisfaction was not sufficient in itself, but was accepted as such by 
God’s sovereign volition ( per liberam [gratuitam ] acceptationem; 
Duns Scotus, Calvin, Arminians). Cp. Heb. 9, 11—14; 1 John 
1, 7; Acts 20, 28; 2 Cor. 5,18—21. 



312 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


b. The error of worJc-righteousness as taught in varying forms 
and degrees by Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians, Arminians, synergists. 
Modernists, etc. — If man can either in whole or in part secure 
reconciliation by his good works, it would not have been necessary 
for the Son of God to become man and suffer and die in his stead. 
Cp. Gal. 3, 10—13; Rom. 8, 3. 4; etc. Quenstedt: "Filius Dei 
non venisset nec humanam naturam assumpsisset, si homo in statu 
integritatis perstitisset.” 

c. The error of denying the active obedience of Christ (An¬ 
selm, Parsimonius, modern theologians). If Christ had not ful¬ 
filled the Law in our stead, we ourselves would have to fulfil it and 
thus earn salvation, at least in part. Cp. Gal. 4, 4. 5; Rom. 5,18. 

d. The error that Christ by His suffering and death paid the 
ransom-price to Satan (Origen). According to Scripture, Christ 
indeed has given Himself an offering and a sacrifice, but to God, 
to satisfy the claims of His perfect justice (iustitia Dei legislatoria 
et vindicativa). Cp. Eph. 5, 2; 2 Cor. 5,18—21. 

e. The error that Christ made satisfaction only for the sins 
of the elect (Calvinists). Cp. 2 Cor. 5, 18—21; 1 John 2, 2; 
1 Tim. 2, 6. 

f. The errors implied in the various theories regarding Christ's 
death which rationalists substitute for the Scriptural doctrine of 
the vicarious atonement. 1) The Accident Theory. Christ’s death 
was an accident as unforeseen and unexpected as the death of any 
other martyr (Modernists). Cp. Matt. 16, 21; Mark 9, 30—32; 
John 10,17.18, etc. 2) The Martyr Theory. Christ gave up His 
life for a principle of truth as any other martyr (Modernists). 
Cp. 1 Tim. 2, 6; 1 John 2, 2. 3) The Moral-example Theory 
(moral-influence theory, moral-power view of atonement). Christ’s 
death has an influence upon mankind for moral improvement. The 
example of His suffering softens human hearts and helps man to 
reform, repent, and better his condition (transformation of char¬ 
acter, Horace Bushnell). Cp. Rom. 5, 12—18; 1 John 1, 7. 
4) The Governmental Theory. God made an example of suffering 
in Christ in order to exhibit to man that sin is displeasing in His 
sight; or: God’s government of the world makes it necessary for 
Him to show His wrath against sin (Hugo Grotius; New England 
Theology). 5) The Declaratory Theory. Christ died to show men 
how much God loves them (Ritschl). While the death of Christ 
indeed exhibits the great love of God for fallen man, the purpose 
of His death was primarily to redeem lost mankind, John 3, 16; 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


313 


1 John 4,10. 6) The Guaranty Theory. Reconciliation is based, 
not on Christ’s expiation for sin, but on His guaranty to win 
followers and conquer their sinfulness (Schleiennaeher, Kirn, 
Hofmann). 

All these man-made theories of the atonement deny Christ’s 
vicarious satisfaction and are based on the same leading thought: 
salvation by works, or salvation through personal sanctification. 

g. The error of restitution (anoxazdoraoic). Christ died also 
for the fallen angels, so that they, too, will be restored to holi¬ 
ness and perfection in the consummation of all things. Cp. Matt. 
25, 41. 46. 

h. The error involved in the papistic Mass, which purports to 
be the “unbloody repetition of the sacrifice of Christ, necessary 
for propitiation.” We reject the Mass as a blasphemous denial of 
the efficacy of Christ’s one complete and perfect redemption, Heb. 
7,26.27; 9,12; 10,14; John 19,30. 

4. THE PRIESTLY INTERCESSION OF CHRIST. 

The sacerdotal office of Christ embraces two parts: a) satis¬ 
faction and b) intercession. 

Already in His state of humiliation Christ interceded for men 
(intercessio terrestris), John 14,16; 17,9; Heb. 5, 6—10. From 
the nature of Christ’s intercessions these are divided into two 
classes: a) general intercessions (intercessio generalis), Luke 
23, 34, which were made for men in general; and b) special inter¬ 
cessions (intercessio specialis), John 17, 9ff., which were offered up 
for believers. 

However, Christ remains a Priest also after His exaltation, 
Heb. 7, 24. 25, and in this state He administers His priestly office, 
not by repeating His atoning work, Rom. 6, 9.10; Heb. 9,12—15; 
7, 26. 27, but by interceding for the elect of God (intercessio 
coelestis). This perpetual intercession of the exalted Christ has 
no atoning value (intercessio Christi in statu exaltationis non est 
satisfactory), but merely applicative value (intercessio Christi in 
statu exaltationis est applicatoria), Heb. 7, 24. 25; 1 John 2, 1; 
Rom. 8,34; that is to say, it relates to the gathering and preserva¬ 
tion of the Church, or to the salvation of the elect (Christus est 
Mediator reconciliationis), Rom. 8, 34; Heb. 7, 25; 1 John 2, 1. 

According to Scripture the heavenly intercession of our glori¬ 
fied Mediator is both real (intercessio reaJis), that is. He presents 
to the Father perpetually the holy blood which He shed for the sins 



314 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


of the world (Chemnitz: Ostendit vultui Dei, quae stigmata pro 
redemptione nostra accepit, Heb. 9, 12), and verbal (intercessio 
verbalis), that is, He actually prays for men, Heb. 7, 25; Eom. 
8,34; 1 John 2,1, though this must be understood in a manner 
becoming the exalted Lord, who sits at the right hand of God 
(intercessio incomprehensibilis). 

In contradistinction to the intercession of the Holy Spirit 
(intercessio Spiritus Sancti), Eom. 8, 26. 27, the exalted Christ 
intercedes as the God-man ( intercessio deavdgixri) and on the basis 
of His own merits (merito ipsius intercessoris), while the inter¬ 
cession of the Holy Spirit ( intercessio deixrj, Eom. 8, 27, “accord¬ 
ing to the will of God,” xaza deov) rests on the ground of Christ’s 
redemption (merito alterius), Gal. 4, 4—6. 

The constant intercession of the exalted Savior at the right 
hand of God gives the believer the most certain assurance of his 
final salvation, Eom. 8, 34—39. 

The Unitarians (Modernists) deny Christ’s vicarious satis¬ 
faction and therefore reject Christ’s intercession, which is based 
upon His atonement. According to the Unitarian view, Christ’s 
only function as priest is to inspire men by precept and example 
to become their own saviors. The papists supplement Christ’s 
intercessory work with the intercessions and merit of the saints and 
thus deny the Scriptural truth that Christ is the only Mediator 
between God and man, 1 Tim. 2, 5. 6. 

C. THE KINGLY OFFICE OF CHRIST. 

(De Munere Regio.) 

The kingly office of Christ is described in all those passages 
of Holy Scripture in which it is said that to Him in time universal 
dominion has been communicated, Eph. 1, 20—23; Matt. 11, 27; 
28,18; Ps. 2, 6. 8; 8,6; 1 Cor. 15, 27; etc. The universal char¬ 
acter of Christ’s rule is emphatically stated in Scripture; for it 
teaches very clearly that the dominion of the Son of Man extends 
a) to all nations and peoples, Dan. 7,13.14; b) to all things on 
earth, in the air, and in the sea, Ps. 8, 6—8; and c) even to the 
enemies of Christ, Ps. 110, 2. In short, from the glorious reign of 
Christ nothing is excluded except God Himself, 1 Cor. 15, 27. 
Hence the kingly office of Christ has been very aptly defined as 
“the theanthropic function of Christ whereby He divinely controls 
and governs, according to both natures, the divine and the human 
(the latter as exalted to the right hand of majesty), all creatures 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


315 


whatever in the kingdoms of power, grace, and glory by infinite 
majesty and power” (Quenstedt). 

Also in His state of humiliation Christ was a true King, pos¬ 
sessing and exercising divine power, not only according to His 
divine nature (essentially), but also according to His human nature 
(by way of communication), as was shown in the article on the 
second genus of the communication of attributes (genus maiesta -- 
txcum). To the incarnate Christ, Scripture ascribes government, 
Is. 9, 6, kingship, John 18, 37, divine power, Matt. 28,18, etc., in 
an absolute degree, that is to say, in the same manner as to God 
Himself. But the full and constant use of the divine dominion 
communicated to the human nature was not exercised by our Savior 
until His exaltation at the right hand of God, Eph. 1, 20—23; 
4,10; Phil. 2,9—11. 

On the basis of clear Scripture-passages our dogmaticians 
speak of Christ’s threefold kingdom, of power, of grace, and of 
glory. However, this threefold division must not be understood 
as if there were three separate kingdoms over which our Lord rules. 
In reality the dominion of Christ is one, though it exerts itself in 
different spheres, according to the different character of those who 
are governed. (Pro diversa ratione eorum, quos rex Christus sibi 
svJbiectos respicit et diversimode gubemat. Baier.) Thus Christ 
rules over all unbelievers, apostate angels, and irrational creatures 
by means of His omnipotent power (regnum potentiae), Ps. 2, 9f.; 
45, 5; 8, 6—8; 97, 7.10; 1 Tim. 6,14—16; Rev. 17,14. 

In a general way all creatures as such belong to Christ’s 
Kingdom of Power because the regnum potentiae is essentially the 
realm of nature (regnum naturae). 

All who in true faith have accepted Christ’s Gospel of recon¬ 
ciliation, 1 Cor. 15, 1, He most graciously rules through His re¬ 
vealed Word (regnum gratiae), John 8,31.32. To the Kingdom 
of Grace belong only those who have been justified by faith or 
who by faith are true members of the Christian Church on earth 
(ecclesia millions), the latter term being a synonym of the former, 
Rom. 5,1. 2; Acts 5,14. While Satan works in all unbelievers as 
in “children of disobedience,” Eph. 2, 2, the exalted Christ exercises 
His gracious dominion in all who by faith acknowledge Him as 
their Lord, John 14, 23. 

All true believers, who in this life were subject to Christ in 
His Kingdom of Grace, will forever be His subjects in the Kingdom 
of Glory (regnum gloriae), which is the continuation of the King- 



316 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


dom of Grace in perfection, Acts 7, 55. 56; 1 Pet. 5, 4; 1 John 3, 2. 
Then the adherents of the Church Militant (membra ecclesiae mili - 
tantis), Eom. 8,17, will be members of the Church Triumphant 
(membra ecclesiae triumphantis), Rom. 5, 2; John 17, 24. To 
point out the inestimable blessings of Christ’s Kingdom of Grace 
and the ineffable bliss of His Kingdom of Glory is the real burden 
of Christian preaching, the purpose of which is not only to make 
sinners partakers of eternal life, but also to fill them with an 
ardent longing for heaven, 1 Cor. 1,7; Rom. 8, 23; Titus 2,13; 
2 Pet. 3,13; Phil. 3, 20. 

In this world the Kingdom of Power serves the Kingdom of 
Grace, Matt. 28,18; Rom. 8, 28; for in both kingdoms the same 
Lord governs all things to His glory, Eph. 1, 20—23, with the same 
almighty power, Eph. 1, 19; 1 Pet. 1, 5, sustaining the present 
world for the sake of His elect, Matt. 24, 22; 2 Pet. 3, 9, and pro¬ 
tecting His Church Militant against all attacks of the gates of hell. 
Matt. 16,18. 

While the dominion of our Lord Jesus Christ is one, yet His 
Kingdom of Grace must not be confounded with His Kingdom of 
Power. Christ Himself thus distinguishes His Kingdom of Grace 
from the kingdoms of this world, John 18, 36. Although the King¬ 
dom of Grace (the Church) is in the world, it is not of this world, 
1 John 2, 5; John 17,16. The world is only the domicile of the 
Kingdom of Grace, John 17,11.15; 1 Tim. 2,1—4, which is not 
built and maintained after the manner of earthly kingdoms, Mark 
16,15. 16. The kingdoms of this world are formed and preserved 
through the divine institution of civil government, Rom. 13,1—4, 
while the Kingdom of Grace is founded and sustained alone 
through the means of grace (the Word and the Sacraments), 
Matt. 28, 19. 20. 

But not only must the Kingdom of Grace be distinguished 
from the Kingdom of Power, but Scripture likewise distinguishes 
it from the Kingdom of Glory, 1 John 3, 2; Rom. 8,24. 25, though 
formally the two cannot be separated, John 5,24; 3,36; Col. 3, 
2—4; Gal. 4,26. They agree in having the same Lord and the 
same blessings of divine grace, but differ a) with respect to the 
mode of perceiving divine things; for while in the Kingdom of 
Grace all divine knowledge is mediate, that is, is obtained through 
faith in the Word (cognitio abstractiva), John 8, 31. 32, in the 
Kingdom of Glory it is immediate, that is, it is received through 
beatific vision (cognitio intuitiva), 1 Cor. 13, 12; and b) with 



THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


317 


respect to the different external conditions of the members of the 
two kingdoms; for while the condition of the Church Militant is 
one of distress and tribulation, Acts 14, 22, that of the Church 
Triumphant is one of supreme glory. Rev. 7,17; 21, 3. 4. 

The doctrine of Christ's kingly office is an article of faith; 
that is to say, on the basis of Scripture we believe that Christ rules 
most gloriously in His kingdoms of power, grace, and glory. In 
the Kingdom of Power we indeed see the objects of Christ's reign, 
but not Christ's ruling scepter, Heb. 2,8. Indeed, quite frequently 
it appears as if Satan were ruling this world, and not God. In 
Christ’s Kingdom of Grace the means indeed are perceptible, for 
we hear the Gospel and see the external Sacraments; yet the king¬ 
dom itself is invisible to us, since it is internal, or in the hearts 
of men, Luke 17, 20. 21; 1 Pet. 2, 5. But in spite of the opposi¬ 
tion of the devil, Matt. 16,18, of false teachers, 2 Tim. 2,17—19, 
and of the world, John 16, 33, we believe that the Christian Church, 
or the Kingdom of Grace, will exist on earth till the end of time. 
Matt. 28, 20. The Kingdom of Glory, which will be revealed in 
the Lord’s own appointed time. Acts 1, 7, is, however, always the 
object of the Christian’s fondest hope, 1 John 3, 2; Rom. 5, 2; 
8, 24. 25, and for its coming he continually waits and ardently 
prays, Phil. 3, 20. 

ERRORS REGARDING THE KINGLY OFFICE OF CHRIST. 

With respect to the kingly office of Christ all those err from 
the divine truth who deny the Scriptural doctrine concerning His 
divine person and His divine work. Of the many errorists we 
mention the following: — 

a. The papists and Reformed, who separate the human nature 
from the divine nature by denying the communication of attri¬ 
butes and consider Christ to be King only according to His divine 
nature, Matt. 28,18; 11, 27; Phil. 2, 9—11; etc. 

b. The modern kenoticists, who deny the divine kingship of 
Christ in His state of humiliation and claim that Christ, when 
becoming incarnate, completely emptied Himself (ixevwoev) of the 
divine attributes of omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. 
In that case Christ could not be King even according to His 
divine nature, Col. 2, 3. 9; John 1,14. 

c. The Subordinationists, who deny that Christ according to 
His divine nature is consubstantial (6/ioovaiog) with the Father and 
hence exclude Him from the eternal divine reign, whereas Scrip- 



318 


THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST. 


ture ascribes to Him an everlasting dominion, Luke 1, 33; Eph. 
1, 21. — The subjection of which St. Paul speaks in 1 Cor. 15, 
27. 28 refers to the change of Christ’s present mode of rule, which 
is mediate and hidden, into a mode of rule which is immediate, 
revealed, and common to Christ together with the Father and the 
Holy Ghost. 

d. All who reject Christ’s rule in His Church by substituting 
human doctrine and ordinances for Christ’s Word and ordinances. 
Matt. 23, 8; 15, 9, as, for example, all false prophets, 1 John 2,18, 
and, above all, the Papacy, 2 Thess. 2,4, or the Antichrist. 

e. All who intermingle the regnum naturae and the regnum 
gratiae, or State and Church (papists. Reformed, and other en¬ 
thusiasts). 

f. All chiliasts, or millenarians, who teach the establishment 
by Christ of a dominion which is neither a Kingdom of Grace nor 
a Kingdom of Glory, but a caricature of both, namely, a reign of 
thousand years in duration, which will either precede or follow 
His second advent (premillenarians; postmillenarians). We re¬ 
ject the figment of millennialism, because, contrary to Scripture, 
it a) changes Christ’s spiritual kingdom into a visible, or earthly, 
kingdom and b) directs the hope of all Christians, not to the per¬ 
fect glory of heaven, 1 Cor. 1, 7; Phil. 3, 20. 21; John 17, 24, but 
to a future earthly glory, which Scripture clearly repudiates. Matt. 
24,1—42. 

g. All Modernists, who deny Christ’s vicarious atonement; for 
if Christ is not the great High Priest, He is neither the glori¬ 
fied and exalted King of heaven and earth. The Christ of Mod¬ 
ernism is a mere man, who could never rule with power at God’a 
right hand. 

h. All advocates of work-righteousness (papists, Arminians, 
etc.); for all who endeavor to be justified by the Law are fallen 
from grace. Gal. 5, 4, and hence cannot acknowledge Christ as their 
gracious and glorious King. Those who reject Christ’s regnum 
gratiae must likewise reject His regnum gloriae. Luther: “All 
who do not have Christ for their King and are not adorned with 
His righteousness are, and forever will be, in the kingdom of the 
devil, in sin and in death.” (St. L., V, 148.) 



THE DOCTRINE OF SOTERIOLOOY. 


819 


THE DOCTRINE OF SOTERIOLOGY. 

(Soteriologia.) 

The purpose of the doctrine of soteriology is to show how 
the Holy Spirit applies to the individual sinner the blessed salva¬ 
tion which Christ has secured for all mankind by His vicarious 
atonement. The subject is treated under various heads: The 
Appropriation of Salvation, Applicatio Salutis a Christo Acqui- 
sitae; The Appropriating Grace of the Holy Spirit, Gratia Spiritus 
Sancti Applicatrix; The Way of Salvation, Via Salutis, Ratio Con- 
sequendi Salutem ; The Order of Salvation, Or do Salutis, etc. In 
German the following terminology is used: Die Heilsaneignung; 
Der Eeilsweg; Die Heilsordnung; Die aneignende Gnade des 
Heiligen Geistes, etc. 

A general survey of the doctrine of soteriology embraces the 
following truths. The salvation, or forgiveness of sins, which 
Christ has procured for all men by His vicarious atonement, Luke 
1, 77; Rom. 5, 10; 2 Cor. 5, 19, is offered to the sinner in the 
means of grace, that is to say, in the Gospel and the Sacraments, 
2 Cor. 5,19; Luke 24, 47. Through this most gracious and effi¬ 
cacious offer of forgiveness, faith is wrought in the heart of the 
sinner, Rom. 10,17, which accepts, or appropriates, the merits of 
Christ proffered in the means of grace. 

The means of grace thus perform a twofold function: they 
offer and confer forgiveness (media oblativa sive dativa), and they 
produce faith (media operativa sive effectiva). Media dativa ex 
parte Dei gignunt fidem sive medium Xrjmixov ex parte hominis. 

By creating faith in the heart of the sinner through His 
almighty power, 1 Cor. 2,14; Eph. 1,19. 20, the Holy Spirit con¬ 
verts and justifies him. Acts 16, 31; Rom. 5, If. Now the sinner 
no longer flees from God, but turns to Him as to His reconciled, 
gracious Lord, Acts 11,21. 

As soon as the sinner by faith accepts God’s general pardon, 
or the objective justification, the pardon becomes effective in his 
case, and he is personally justified (subjective justification). By 
accepting Christ’s righteousness, he has made it his own and is 
therefore regarded as righteous before God, Rom. 4, 3; Ps. 32,1. 2. 

Justification (a forensic, not a medical act) is thus by grace 
alone, without works, Rom. 3, 28. It puts the believer in posses¬ 
sion of all the merits or blessings secured by Christ’s perfect obe¬ 
dience. The justified sinner has entered into the state of grace 
and peace (status gratiae, status pads), in which he is assured 



820 


THE DOCTRINE OF SOTERIOLOOY. 


of his present and final salvation, Eom. 5, 1—6, his final salva¬ 
tion being guaranteed by God’s grace and truth, Rom. 5, 1—11; 
8, 38. 39; 1 Cor. 1,8. 9. Iustificatio est res gratis promissa propter 
Christum, quare sola fide semper coram Deo accipitur. (Apology, 
Art. Ill, 96.) 

Justification effects the mystical union (unio mystica), by 
which the Holy Trinity, in particular the Holy Spirit, dwells in the 
believer, Gal. 3,2; Eph. 3,17; John 14,23; 1 Cor. 3,16; 6,19. 
The unio mystica is a peculiar indwelling, which is distinct from 
God’s general presence with all creatures (unio generalis), since 
God dwells essentially in the believer. Yet it is not a pantheistic 
transformation of the essence of the believer into the essence of 
God. It is the result of justification, not the cause of it. Gal. 3, 2; 
Eph. 3,17. 

Justification produces sanctification. To teach that sanctifica¬ 
tion produces justification means to champion the basic papistic 
error of justification by works, Rom. 7, 5. 6; 2 Cor. 3, 6; Gal. 2, 20; 
3, 2. 3; Rom. 3, 28. 

Justification makes the sinner a member in the Christian 
Church (regnum gratiae), Eph. 1,17—23; Acts 4, 4; 2, 41, and in 
the Kingdom of Glory (regnum gloriae), Luke 23, 43; John 11, 25. 

In this connection Holy Scripture also teaches that we owe 
the possession and enjoyment of all these blessings to the eternal 
election of grace, Eph. 1, 3ff.; Rom. 8, 28—30; 2 Tim. 1, 9; 
Acts 13, 48. 

In the ordo salutis the relation of the various articles to one 
another must be rightly observed. Christ’s vicarious satisfaction 
and the reconciliation of God with the world form the basis of all 
soteriological teachings, while the article of the sinner’s justifica¬ 
tion by faith is the central and chief article of the Christian re¬ 
ligion. Sanctification follows justification as its effect. To justifi¬ 
cation sola fide all other doctrines of Scripture stand in relation of 
cause and effect, of antecedens et consequens. Right here lies the 
fundamental difference between the Christian religion and all man¬ 
made religions. Christianity teaches sanctification as the effect of 
justification by grace through faith; all man-made religions reverse 
the process and teach justification by works, or by sanctification. 

Luther says: "In corde meo iste unus regnat articulus, 
scilicet fides Christi, ex quo, per quern et in quern omnes meae diu 
noctuque fluunt et refluunt theologiae cogitationes. (Erl. Ed., I, 3. 
Cf. Christi. Dogmatik, II, 473—503; also Dr. Engelder, Dogmat¬ 
ical Notes.) 



THE DOCTRINE OP SAVING FAITH. 


321 


THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 

(De Fide Salvifica.) 


1. THE NECESSITY OF FAITH. 

Through His vicarious atonement (satisfactio vicaria) Christ 
has secured for guilty and condemned mankind a perfect recon¬ 
ciliation with God ( reconciliatio, xaraMayij), because He, in man’s 
stead, has fulfilled the demands of the divine Law and made satis¬ 
faction for the sins of the world (obedientia activa, obedientia 
passiva). In Christ Jesus, therefore, God is gracious toward all 
sinners and absolves them from all guilt (objective justification, 
iustificatio obiectiva). 

This comforting fact God announces to the world through 
the ordained means of grace (the Word and the Sacraments) 
and demands at the same time faith in the message of reconcilia¬ 
tion, 2 Cor. 5, 19—21; Acts 2, 38; 16, 31; 10, 42. 43; 13, 39; 
26,27—29. It is God’s declared will that all men should appro¬ 
priate to themselves by faith the saving grace which has been 
secured for them by the divinely appointed Savior, Mark 1,14.16; 
Acts 16, 31. Those who refuse to believe the reconciliation effected 
by Christ are lost in spite of the fact that also for them salvation 
has been obtained, Mark 16,16.16; John 3,16.18. 36; 2 Pet. 2,1. 
For this reason we affirm that faith is needed for the acquiring of 
salvation (necessitas fidei ad salutem consequendam). The ration¬ 
alistic views that God is gracious toward sinners without Christ’s 
vicarious satisfaction and that man can obtain eternal life by his 
own works or good conduct (Modernists) are emphatically denied 
by Scripture, Gal. 3,10; 5,4. Holy Scripture knows but one way 
to salvation, namely, by grace, through faith in the redemption of 
Christ, Horn. 3, 22—25. 

Our dogmaticians are therefore right when they declare that 
salvation is perfect so far as the acquisition and intention are con¬ 
cerned (ex parte Dei), but not as regards its application by man 
(ex parte hominis), since this must be accomplished through faith. 
Salus perfecta est quoad acquisitionem et intentionem, non quoad 
applicationem, quae fide fieri debet. The meaning of this state¬ 
ment is that salvation indeed has been secured for all men, but that 
the individual sinner must appropriate it unto himself by faith, 
Mark 16,15.16. Fides ex parte hominis ad salutem consequendam 
necessaria est.

THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


2. THE NATURE OF SAVING FAITH. 

If we keep in mind that salvation has been gained for all 
mankind through the vicarious satisfaction of Christ and that this 
salvation is offered to all men through the means of grace, it is 
clear what constitutes saving faith. 

a. Saving faith is not general belief in the existence of God or 
in the divine Law of God; for this belief is held also by the 
heathen, Rom. 1,19. 20. Nor is saving faith mere knowledge of 
(notitia historica), or mere assent (assensus historicus) to, the 
general truths of the Gospel, namely, that Christ lived and died 
for men; for this faith (fides historica, fides generalis) is found 
also in devils, Luke 4, 34; Jas. 2,19, and in unbelievers, John 8, 
43. 45. So also saving faith (fides qua iustificans) is not mere 
knowledge of, nor is it mere assent to, the teachings of Scripture 
in general (Romanists, Arminians, Unitarians). The Law, for 
instance, is not the object of saving faith, since sinners are justified 
without the deeds of the Law, Rom. 3, 28; Eph. 2, 8. 9. Nor is 
“Scripture in general” the object of saving faith, though true be¬ 
lievers, of course, accept the entire Bible as the Word of God; for 
Scripture itself testifies that a sinner is justified before God only 
through his trust in the objective atonement made by Christ, 
Rom. 3, 24. While it is true that no man can be saved who rejects 
the inspired Word of God, it is also true that man’s justification is 
brought about only through his personal confidence in the divine 
promises of the Gospel. Fides salvifica (iustificans) est certa per- 
suasio de venia peccatorum per Christum obtinenda. 

b. Saving faith (fides iustificans) is therefore personal trust 
(fides specialis), or cordial confidence (fiducia cordis), in the won¬ 
derful message of the Gospel that God for Christ’s sake is gracious 
to all who believe in the atoning blood of His Son shed on Calvary 
for the sins of the world, Gal. 2, 20; 1 John 1, 7. Hence saving 
faith is found only in a heart that says: “I believe that Jesus 
Christ... is my Lord, who has redeemed me, a lost and condemned 
creature, purchased and won me from all sins, from death, and 
from the power of the devil, not with gold or silver, but with His 
holy, precious blood and with His innocent suffering and death.” 
In other words, saving faith has for its object the forgiveness of 
sins which was secured by Christ’s perfect obedience and is now 
offered to all sinners in the Gospel, Mark 16,15.16; Luke 24,47. 
All who reject God’s gracious offer of forgiveness for Christ’s sake 
will perish in unbelief, even though they assent to the divine Law

or to “Scripture in general.” Luther: “You must rely with con¬ 
stant trust on this, that Christ died for your sins; such a faith 
justifies you.” (St. L., VIII, 1376.) 

In order to describe saving faith more fully, our dogmaticians 
have said: a) Saving faith is always fides specialis, or the special 
faith by which an individual believes that for Christ’s sake his sins 
are remitted him. The very nature of God’s general promise in the 
Gospel calls for this individual application, Gal. 2,20; Job 19, 25. 
The Church of Rome forbids this application as presumptuous. 
(Cf. Concil. Trid., Sess. VI, Can. 14.) b) Saving faith is always 
fides actualis, or the apprehension of the divine promise by an act 
of the intellect and will. Synonymous terms of fides actualis are 
found in Scripture, Is. 55, 5. 6; John 6, 44; Gal. 3, 27; Matt. 11, 
12. 28. The scholastic theologians defined faith as an “idle habit” 
(otiosus habitus), which Luther condemned as a “mere verbal 
monstrosity, giving no sense.” Also a weak faith and the longing 
for grace in Christ must be regarded as fides actualis, or true faith. 

c) Saving faith is always fides directa, or faith which concerns 
itself directly with the divine promise set forth in the Gospel. 

d) Saving faith is not in every case fides reflexa, reflex, discursive 
faith, by which the believer reflects on, and is conscious of, his 
faith. The faith of infants is true faith, Matt. 18, 6, though the 
fides reflexa is wanting; they have fides specialis, which is fides 
actualis, which is fides directa. (Cf. Dr. Engelder, Dogmatical 
Notes; Christl. Dogmatik, II, 508 ff.) 

Hollaz rightly distinguishes between special faith and general 
faith as follows: “General faith is that by which man . . . believes 
all things to be true that are revealed in the Word of God. Of this 
species of faith we are not now speaking because we are treating 
of faith as the means of salvation. . . . Special faith is that faith 
by which the sinner applies to himself individually thf universal 
promises in reference to Christ, the Mediator, and tie grace of 
God accessible through Him and believes that God d< fires to be 
propitious to him and to pardon his sins on account < f the satis¬ 
faction of Christ made for his and all men’s sins.” ( Doctr . Theol., 
p. 419.) So also the Augsburg Confession (XX, 23) writes: 
“Men are also admonished that here the term faith does not signify 
merely the knowledge of the history, such as is in the ungodly and 
in the devil, but signifies a faith which believes not merely the 
history, but also the effect of the history, namely, . . . that we have 
grace, righteousness, and forgiveness of sins through Christ.” And 



324 


THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


the Apology (Art. XIII [VII], 21) says: “And here we speak of 
special faith, which believes the present promise, not only that 
[faith] which in general believes that God exists, but which believes 
that the remission of sins is offered.” 

From the above it is clear why the Law must be excluded as 
an object of saving faith. The divine Law has no promises of 
grace attached to it, but promises life and salvation on the basis of 
its complete fulfilment, as a reward of personal merit, Luke 10, 28; 
Gal. 3, 12. If the objection is raised that faith itself is called 
obedience (vnaxorf) in Scripture, Rom. 1, 5; Acts 6, 7, we reply 
that faith is indeed obedience, yet not to the Law, but to the Gospel, 
Rom. 10,16. Faith is obedience inasmuch as it accepts the gracious 
promises of God made in the Gospel. But obedience to the Gospel 
and obedience to the Law are opposites; for the first excludes the 
works of men. Gal. 2,16, while the second demands them. Gal. 3,12. 
It is for this reason that the Law cannot be the object of faith. 
Those who make the Law the object of faith, or, what is the same, 
who define saving faith as obedience to the divine Law, teach sal¬ 
vation by works and thus lapse into paganism. They deny the very 
essence of Christianity, namely, the fundamental doctrine of sal¬ 
vation by grace. 

It is true, saving faith, which appropriates the grace of God 
in Christ, manifests itself both in ready acceptance of the Word 
of God and in constant obedience to the Law; but these mani¬ 
festations of saving faith do not constitute the reason why it saves. 
They are rather the fruits and proofs that true faith, which justifies 
and saves without works, Rom. 3, 28; Eph. 2, 8. 9, exists in the 
heart, John 8, 47; 13, 35. 

That faith is essentially (formaliter) trust of the heart (fiducia 
cordis), ( r sincere confidence in the grace of God offered to all 
sinners fo.- Christ’s sake in the Gospel, is strenuously denied by the 
papists, ' ’he Council of Trent declares (Sess. VI, Can. 12): “If 
any one si. >uld say that justifying faith is nothing else than trust 
(fiducia) in the divine compassion which forgives sins for Christ’s 
sake, or that we are justified alone by such trust, let him be 
accursed.” 

But the teaching that is here anathematized, namely, that 
saving faith is essentially fiducia cordis, is a clear doctrine of 
Scripture, Rom. 4, 3—5; 10, 9. The expressions “to believe in 
or on” (moxeveiv elg zov vtov, John 3, 16. 18. 36; eig Xqiotov , 



THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


325 


Gal. 2,16) cannot mean anything else than “to place one’s confi¬ 
dence in,” “to put one’s trust in,” the Son, or Christ. 

The Apology is therefore right when it says (III, 183) : 
“Faith is not only knowledge in the intellect, but also confidence 
in the will; t. e., it is to wish and to receive that which is offered 
in the promise, namely, reconciliation and remission of sins.” And 
again (IV [II], 48): “Faith which justifies is not merely a knowl¬ 
edge of history, . . . but it is to assent to the promise of God, in 
which, for Christ’s sake, the remission of sins and justification are 
freely offered.” Wherever the Scriptural doctrine that faith is 
essentially trust, or confidence, in the promises of the Gospel is 
repudiated, the pagan doctrine of work-righteousness needs must 
follow. 

3. CONCERNING THE TERMS “KNOWLEDGE,” “ASSENT,” 
AND “CONFIDENCE.” 

Since faith has been described as knowledge (notitia), assent 
(assensus), and confidence, or trust (fiducia), it is necessary to 
explain these terms and to point out their relation to one another. 
The following may serve to elucidate the terminology: — 

a. If knowledge and assent are conceived as historic faith 
(fides historica), they are not really parts of saving faith; for also 
devils and unbelievers have both. Of historic faith, or of such 
a faith as merely knows, and regards as true, the “history” of 
Christ, Luther writes (XI, 126): “This is a natural work, without 
grace.” “Of such a faith Scripture, the Word of God, does not 
speak,” that is, when it treats of saving faith. 

Nevertheless, while the fides historica is not a part of saving 
faith, it is a necessary prerequisite of saving faith, since the Holy 
Spirit engenders saving faith only in those hearts which know and 
understand the Gospel of Christ, Rom. 10,17. The so-called “im¬ 
plicit faith” (fides implicita, fides carbonaria) of the papists, ac¬ 
cording to which the “faithful” simply believe “what the Church 
teaches,” though they themselves are ignorant of the doctrine, is 
an absurdity; for without knowledge there can be no true faith. 
When Christ sent out His apostles to make believing disciples of all 
nations, He expressly commanded them to preach the Gospel to 
every creature, Mark 16, 15. 16; Matt. 28, 19. 20, thus showing 
that saving faith must be rooted in knowledge of the Gospel. The 
Lutheran dogmatician Scherzer writes very aptly: “He lies who 
says that he believes what the Church teaches if he does not know 
what she teaches. For no one can believe what he does not know.” 



326 


THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


b. However, if the term notitia is understood in the sense of 
true spiritual knowledge of Christ, which the Holy Ghost works 
through the Gospel (notitia spiritualis) and the term assensus is 
conceived as spiritual assent to the promises of the Gospel, which 
the Holy Ghost likewise works through the Gospel (assensus spiri¬ 
tualis), then both these terms include the fiducia cordis, or the 
sincere confidence of the heart in the grace of God offered in the 
Gospel. In other words, in that case the terms are synonymous. 
This fact is obvious from the Scriptural usage of the terms; for 
at one time it ascribes salvation to knowledge, John 17,3; 2 Cor. 
4,6; Phil. 3, 8; Luke 1,77, at another to assent, 1 John 5,1.5; 
3, 23, and again to confidence, John 3, 16. 18. 36. In all these 
cases knowledge, assent, and confidence are synonyms of saving 
faith, so that each may be used without the other to describe the 
fiducia cordis by which a sinner is saved. The Lutheran dogma- 
tician Buddeus rightly says: “Knowledge without assent and as¬ 
sent without confidence is not that knowledge nor that assent which 
constitutes justifying faith.” Luther: “Faith is a living, bold 
trust in God’s grace, so certain that a man would die a thousand 
times for it.” ( Trigl., p. 941.) 

4. WHY SAVING FAITH JUSTIFIES. 

Saving faith is never without good works, Gal. 5, 6. Indeed, 
it is itself a most excellent virtue, by which God is supremely glori¬ 
fied as the Lord of love, who because of His grace in Christ Jesus 
receives and absolves penitent sinners, Rev. 14, 7. But though 
faith is itself a most precious work and the unfailing source of 
constant good works, it does not save as a good work or as the 
source of good works, but solely as the means ( medium Xrjnzixov), 
by which the believer apprehends the grace of God and the merits 
of Christ which are offered to him in the Gospel. Again, although 
faith is an act of both the intellect and the will of man, — for not 
the Holy Ghost, but the believer himself trusts in the mercy of 
God, — yet it does not justify inasmuch as it is an act or work 
of man. 

These two truths are of the greatest importance for the right 
understanding of the Christian doctrine of salvation by faith (sola 
fide). Our dogmaticians have embodied them in the statement: 
“Faith does not justify in itself, that is, as an act or habit of 
believing, nor through the works which it produces, but in view 



THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


327 


of its object, namely, because it apprehends the grace secured by 
Christ and offered in the Gospel.” 

Hollaz writes: “Justifying faith is the receptive organ and, 
as it were, the hand of the poor sinner by which he applies and 
takes to himself, lays hold of, and possesses, those things which 
are proffered in the free promise of the Gospel. God, the supreme 
Monarch, extends from heaven the hand of grace, the grace ob¬ 
tained by the merit of Christ, and in it offers salvation. The 
sinner, in the abyss of misery, receives as a beggar in his hand of 
faith what is thus offered to him. The offer and the reception are 
correlatives. Therefore the hand of faith, which seizes and appro¬ 
priates the offered treasure, corresponds to the hand of grace which 
offers the treasure of righteousness and salvation.” ( Doctr . Theol., 
p. 420.) 

So also the Formula of Concord (Thor. Decl., Ill, 11. 38) 
says: “Faith is the gift of God by which we apprehend aright 
Christ, our Redeemer, in the Gospel.” “It is faith alone, and noth¬ 
ing else whatever, which is the means and instrument by which the 
grace of God and the merit of Christ in the promise of the Gospel 
are embraced, received, and applied to us.” This important truth 
is taught in all passages of Scripture in which saving faith is placed 
in opposition to human works, Rom. 3, 28; 4, 5; Eph. 2, 8. 9. 

All who teach and believe that saving faith justifies inasmuch 
as it is a good work itself or the source of good works (papists, 
Arminians, rationalists, Modernists) have fallen from grace and 
renounced the Christian faith. Luther: “Christ alone justifies 
me over against my evil works and without my good works. If 
I regard Christ in this way, then I apprehend the right Christ.” 
(St. L., IX, 619.) 

5. FAITH VIEWED AS A PASSIVE ACT OR A PASSIVE 

INSTRUMENT. 

Because saving faith does not itself produce the righteousness 
(grace, justification, forgiveness of sins) by which the sinner is 
saved, but merely accepts the merits that have been secured for 
the world by Christ’s obedience and are offered to all men in the 
Gospel, our dogmaticians have called it a passive act (actus 
passivus) or a passive instrument (instrumentum passivum). 
J. A. Osiander thus writes: Receptio alicuius rei non est actio, sed 
passio. And Dannhauer: Fides patitur sibi benefieri. 

These expressions are Scriptural; for in his conversion man 



828 


THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


does not himself contribute anything, but only receives everything 
as a free gift of God. However, saving faith may be called an 
actus passivus, or an instrumentum passivum, also in view of the 
fact that it is engendered and preserved not by man himself, but 
solely through the gracious operation of the Holy Ghost, Eph. 
1,19; Phil. 2,13. In other words, the penitent sinner does not 
believe in Christ by his own reason or strength, but trusts in Him 
for salvation only because the Holy Ghost has called him by the 
Gospel, enlightened him with His gifts, and sanctified him. The 
Augsburg Confession says (Art. XVIII, 9): “Although nature is 
able in a manner to do the outward work, . . . yet it cannot produce 
the inward motions, such as the fear of God, trust in God, chastity, 
patience, etc.” In this sense faith is called a passive act or a pas¬ 
sive instrument. 

However, these expressions must not be understood as if saving 
faith were not in itself essentially an act of the believer (actus 
apprehendendi) . To deny the activity of faith in this sense would 
mean to deny the essence of faith; for saving faith is by its very 
nature an act of trusting, or confiding, by which the believer appro¬ 
priates to himself the grace offered to him in the Gospel. So Holy 
Scripture itself describes faith when it speaks of it as “receiving 
the atonement,” Rom. 5,11, or “receiving Christ,” John 1,12. 

To express the fact that faith is essentially an act of trusting 
in the Gospel, our dogmaticians have said that saving faith is fides 
actualis, or active confidence. Moreover, they teach on the basis 
of Scripture (Rom. 9, 30; Col. 2, 6; Is. 55, 5. 6; 2, 2. 3; John 
6, 44; 2 Cor. 6, 1; Gal. 3, 27) that to believe means “to desire 
grace,” “to seek Christ,” “to stretch out the hand toward Christ,” 
“to embrace Christ,” “to come to Christ,” “to approach Christ,” 
“to run toward Christ,” “to cleave to Christ,” “to hold to Christ,” 
“to join oneself to Christ,” etc. (Cf. Christl. Dogmatik, Vol. II, 
p. 518 ff.) 

All who deny that saving faith is essentially an act of appre¬ 
hending (actus apprehendendi) and regard it merely as an “inac¬ 
tive quality” (otiosa qualitas) or as a mere “ability to believe” 
(potentia credendi) deny faith altogether; for a faith that does 
not trust in Christ is not faith at all, but a mere fancy. In fact, 
if faith is said to save sinners inasmuch as it is a good quality, then 
salvation is based upon good works, since in that case faith saves 
as a human virtue. 

Luther very strenuously affirmed that the act of apprehending 



THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


329 - 


divine grace is the outstanding characteristic of that true faith 
which is wrought by the Holy Ghost, whereas a mere faith of the 
head (historic faith) or a mere knowledge of the facts of salvation 
does not lay hold of the merits of Christ offered to the sinner in 
the Gospel. Saving faith, then, is always an act of the believer,, 
though it is an act wrought by the Holy Ghost. Luther: “Fides 
est habere Vebbum in corde et non dubitare de Verbo” ( Christl .. 
Dogmatik, II, 522.) 

6. CONCERNING THE EXPRESSIONS “TRUE FAITH” 
AND “LIVING FAITH.” 

With regard to these expressions considerable confusion pre¬ 
vails in co mm on theological parlance. True faith is personal trust,, 
or confidence, in God’s gracious forgiveness of sins for Christ’s 
sake. The term thus stands in contradistinction to implicit faith. 
(fides implicita), or assent to the doctrines of the Church, though 
these may not be known to the person, and to historic faith (fides 
historica), or mere knowledge of, and assent to, the general doc¬ 
trines of the Bible. Neither a fides implicita nor a fides historica 
can justify a sinner; for saving faith is always personal trust in 
the gracious promises of the Gospel. With regard to the term 
living faith (fides viva) we must bear in mind that faith is “living”' 
(viva) only because it apprehends the merits of Christ offered in 
the means of grace. Faith never becomes true or living by the good 
works that follow it. Through the performance of good works- 
faith only manifests itself as true and living before men. We may 
say therefore that every true faith is living faith; and again, that 
every true faith reveals itself as living by proper fruits. These 
distinctions must be carefully observed in order that the element 
of works may not be injected into justifying faith, Rom. 4, 4. 5. 

7. FAITH AND THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION. 

Since saving faith is the believer’s trust in the perfect right¬ 
eousness which Christ has secured for all men by His vicarious 
satisfaction and which therefore exists even before a person be¬ 
lieves, it is clear that a believer is in full possession of divine 
pardon, life, and salvation from the very moment in which he 
puts His trust in Christ; for in that very moment all the merits of 
Christ’s suffering and death are imputed to him, Acts 16, 31. For 
this reason the believer is also certain of his salvation; for saving 
faith is in its very nature the truest and greatest certainty. If 



830 


THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


papists and Romanizing Protestants deny that the believer may be 
sure of his salvation, it is because they teach that salvation, in part 
at least, depends on the believer’s good works, in other words, 
because they intermingle justification with sanctification. It is 
evident that all who reject the sola gratia and make salvation de¬ 
pend on man’s character, righteousness, and good works must deny 
also the certainty of salvation. Work-righteousness always produces 
doubt and uncertainty, while personal trust in the vicarious atone¬ 
ment of Christ and His objective justification always effects a most 
joyous assurance of salvation in the believer’s heart. From this 
follows the rule that, if a believer wishes to be sure of his salvation, 
he must unflinchingly adheTe to the gracious promises of the 
Gospel. As soon as he turns away from them, he will be lost in 
a sea of doubt. 

The certainty of salvation, which is produced through the 
Gospel, is not natural (fides humana), but supernatural and spir¬ 
itual (fides divina), since it is wrought in the heart of the believer 
by the Holy Ghost through the means of grace. By nature all 
men seek salvation by works. Hence the certainty of salvation 
which the unregenerate claim to possess is based upon their com¬ 
pliance with the divine Law, Luke 18,11. Such certainty, how¬ 
ever, must be condemned as sinful presumption, since all who 
would be justified by the Law are under the curse, Gal. 3,10. True 
certainty, on the other hand, which trusts divine grace without 
works, is the gift of the Holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 2,4. 5. 

8. CAN THE BELIEVER BE SURE OF POSSESSING 
SAVING FAITH? 

In the controversies on faith the question has been propounded 
whether a Christian may be sure of possessing true faith. The 
question has been emphatically denied by Romanists and Roman¬ 
izing Protestants, while Holy Scripture very strenuously affirms it, 
2 Tim. 1,12; 4, 7. 

It is true, a believer may not always be conscious of his 
faith. Saving faith (fides directa, fides actualis) need not always 
be conscious faith (fides reflexa), or faith which is perceived by 
the believer. (Fides reflexa et discursiva, qua homo renatus credit 
et sentit se credere.) Thus Christian adults, while asleep or en¬ 
grossed with their daily occupation, indeed possess direct faith, 
which truly apprehends the grace of God in Christ Jesus, yet not 
reflex and discursive faith. That is to say, they meditate neither 



THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


331 


on their act of faith nor on their state of faith. For the time 
being faith with all that it implies has passed out of their direct 
consciousness. They may even be in a condition of coma, not 
being able to reflect on spiritual things at all; or they may be in 
a state of trial (in statu tentationis), when they believe themselves 
to be without faith because they have lost the sense, or feeling, 
of faith (sensus fidei). In all such cases saving faith truly exists, 
though the believer is not conscious of it. Even in baptized infants, 
faith is not a mere potentiality to believe (potentia credendi) or 
an inactive quality (otiosus habitus), but /ides actualis, or actual 
trust in, and active apprehension of, divine grace (actus appre- 
hendendi), as Christ directly testifies (Matt. 18, 6: ol /uixgol ol 
mozevovze<; elg l/ue). 

However, the doctrine regarding reflex faith must not be 
abused in the interest of carnal security and indiffercntism; for 
it is God’s will that all believers should be sure of their state of 
faith and grace, Rom. 5,1. 2. If Christians entertain doubts con¬ 
cerning their faith, such doubts should be removed. This necessi¬ 
tates the preaching of the Law in order to show that unbelief and 
doubt are sinful and displeasing to God, John 8, 46; Matt. 14, 31. 
But above all the preaching of the Gospel is necessary, Rom. 5, 20; 
8,15—17, which alone works certainty of faith, John 8, 31. 32, and 
dispels all doubts. 

It is well to remind the doubting, fearing Christian also of 
the fact that even the desire to be saved through Jesus Christ is 
already actual, or direct, faith; for such a desire is never found in 
the natural, unregenerate heart, 1 Cor. 2,14, but is the gift of the 
Holy Spirit, Eph. 1, 19; Rom. 8, 23. The Formula of Concord 
rightly says (Thor. Decl., II, 14): “To all godly Christians who 
feel and experience in their hearts a small spark or longing for 
divine grace (scintillula aliqua et desiderium gratiae divinae) and 
eternal salvation this precious passage [Phil. 2, 13] is very com¬ 
forting; for they know that God has kindled in their hearts this 
beginning of true godliness and that He will further strengthen 
and help them in their great weakness to persevere in true faith 
unto the end.” (Cf. Matt. 17, 20: 1 Eav tyrgze nioziv dbg xoxxov 
aivanecog.) 

Because the assurance which a believer has concerning His 
state of grace (certitudo gratiae) is not found in man’s heart by 
nature, but is engendered in him by the Holy Spirit, it is rightly 
said that such certainty rests upon the testimony of the Holy 



332 


THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


Ghost (testimonium Spiritus Sancti). The testimony of the Holy 
Spirit is both internal (testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum) 
and external (testimonium Spiritus Sancti externum). The in¬ 
ternal, or direct, witness of the Holy Spirit is nothing else than 
faith, which assures the believer that he is a child of God, consoles 
and strengthens him in all adversity and temptation, and preserves 
him in the hope of eternal life, Rom. 8, 15. 16; 1 John 5, 10; 
Phil. 1, 6. The internal testimony of the Holy Spirit is therefore 
not something that exists without faith or by the side of faith, but 
it is faith itself, 1 John 5, 10. Cp. the Apology (Trigl., p. 154, 
§ 113, German text): “But faith, properly so called (proprie 
dicta), is when my heart and the Holy Ohost in the heart says: 
The promise of God is true and certain. Of this faith Scrip¬ 
ture speaks.” 

The external testimony of the Holy Spirit consists in this, 
that God through the means of grace works in the believer manifest 
fruits of faith, such as love for God and His Word, John 8, 47; 
1 Thess. 1, 3—6; 2 Thess. 2,13—15, and love for the neighbor, 
1 John 3, 14, which bear witness to his state of grace. Gal. 5, 
22—24. This external witness of the Holy Ghost, which occurs 
only in true believers, must be distinguished from the carnal trust 
which the unregenerate put in their external “good works,” which 
carnal trust in their “dead good works” proves convincingly that 
they are self-righteous and therefore not children of God, Luke 
18,10—14. 

Every true believer in Christ therefore is sure of his state of 
grace and salvation; for the Holy Spirit, who through the Gospel 
has engendered faith in him, assures him by that very faith that 
he is a child of God and an heir of eternal life, Rom. 8,15—17. 

9. THE FAITH OF INFANTS. 

That saving faith (fides directa, fides actuaXis) is found not 
only in adults, but also in regenerate infants is proved in Scrip¬ 
ture by the following: a) Scripture directly ascribes to such chil¬ 
dren saving faith, Matt. 18, 6; 1 John 2,13; Ps. 8, 2; b) Scrip¬ 
ture ascribes to them the fruit and effect of saving faith, namely, 
eternal life, Mark 10,14. The example of John the Baptist, Luke 
1, 41—44, who was filled with the Holy Ghost while yet in the 
womb of his mother, proves that children can believe before they 
have reached the years of discretion, though in this case the ordi¬ 
nary means of grace (the Word and the Sacraments) were not

applied. If from this exceptional case the conclusion is drawn 
that it is not necessary for us to apply in every instance the means 
of grace to infants, we answer that God has indeed bound us to 
the use of these means, Mark 16,15.16; Matt. 28,19. 20, but that 
He Himself is not bound to them. 

While it is impossible for us to describe in detail the faith 
of infants, we must hold that it is nevertheless an active trust in 
the divine promises of grace, or an active apprehension of the 
merits of Christ, Matt. 18, 6; Ps. 71, 6. Fides infantium fides ac- 
tualis est, non habitus otiosus vel mera potentia. Gerhard rightly 
remarks: “We are not solicitous about the mode of this faith, but 
we simply acquiesce in the fact that infants really believe.” ( Doctr . 
Theol., p. 549.) 

10. THE USE OF THE TERM “FAITH” IN SCRIPTURE. 

Holy Scripture does not always use the term faith in the 
same meaning. In some passages it denotes faithfulness, or trust¬ 
worthiness, as found both in God and in man. Faith in this sense 
is applied to God in Rom. 3, 3 and to the regenerate in Gal. 5, 22. 
Faith in the sense of faithfulness is in believers a fruit of justify¬ 
ing faith and belongs into the article of sanctification and not into 
that of justification. In other words, faith justifies and saves, 
not as faithfulness, or trustworthiness, that is to say, not as a good 
work in the regenerate, but as the receiving means (medium 
XrjTtuxov) by which the believer appropriates to himself the grace 
of God and the merits of Christ offered to him in the Gospel. 
In its proper sense, that is, regarded as the means by which the 
believer receives divine grace, faith always denotes trust in the 
merciful promises of God in Christ Jesus, Mark 16, 15. 16; 
1,14.15; 9, 23. 24; Heb. 11,1. Or we may say, justifying faith 
in this sense is always fides passiva, which saves not in view of its 
own worth as a virtue, but in view of its object, namely, the grace 
of God and the merits of Christ, which it appropriates. Cf. the 
Apology: “Faith justifies and saves, not on the ground that it is 
a work in itself worthy (opus per sese dignum), but only because it 
receives the promised mercy.” ( Trigl., p. 137.) 

In a few passages of Scripture, such as Acts 6, 7; Gal. 1,23; 
Jude 3. 20; etc., the term faith denotes the Christian doctrine 
(fides, quae creditur), or the Gospel of salvation by grace through 
faith in Christ. Faith in this sense is called objective faith (fides 
cbiectiva) in contradistinction to justifying faith, which is termed 



334 


THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


subjective faith (fides subiectiva), since it is found in the heart of 
the individual believer. To understand this use of the term faith, 
we must remember that personal trust in the grace of God for 
Christ’s sake (fiducia) is indeed the central article of the entire 
Christian religion, so that in this case the Christian doctrine re¬ 
ceives its name from its chief characteristic. Whenever our dogma- 
ticians speak of fides, quae creditur, they mean the doctrine of sal¬ 
vation which must be believed; when they speak of fides, qua 
creditur, they mean justifying or saving faith, that is, the receiv¬ 
ing means of salvation ( medium Igmixov ).— In passing, it may 
be said that some exegetes aver that n tor is in the New Testament 
is never employed in an objective, but only in a subjective sense, 
so that mans always denotes the fides, qua creditur, never the fides , 
quae creditur. (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, Vol. II, p. 540 ff.) 

With respect to the terminology of the Church on this point 
we may note, by way of review, the following: 1) Implicit faith 
is alleged assent to doctrines though these may not be known to- 
the individual (fides carbonaria, Koehlerglaube: “I believe what 
the Church teaches”). 2) Explicit faith (fides explicita) is assent 
to doctrines distinctly known. 3) Justifying, or saving, faith is 
personal trust in the gracious remission of sin for Christ’s sake. 
4) Direct faith is faith which lays hold of the grace of God in 
Christ Jesus. Justifying faith is always direct. 5) Reflex, or dis¬ 
cursive, faith is faith by which the regenerate perceives that he be¬ 
lieves. Infants, and adults while asleep or unconscious, have direct 
faith, but not reflex or discursive faith. 6) General faith (fides 
generalis) is assent to all truths revealed in God’s Word. 7) Special 
faith (fides specialis) is justifying faith, or personal trust in the 
grace of God for Christ’s sake. The object of general faith is 
the whole Bible ; that of special faith is the promise of the Gospel 
concerning the grace of God and the remission of sins through 
Christ’s vicarious satisfaction. 8) A false, or vain and dead, faith 
is called faith only equivocally, because it is nothing but an empty 
boast or a bold presumption upon the mercy and grace of God 
made by impenitent men (Hollaz). 9) Faith is said to be weak, 
or infirm, when either the knowledge of Christ is weak or the 
confidence in Christ is infirm. 10) Faith is strong when either the 
knowledge of Christ, or the trust in Him, is strong. 11) Objective 
faith is the doctrine which is believed. 12) Subjective faith is the 
faith by which one believes. 13) Historic faith is mere knowledge 
of Christ without personal trust in Him. 14) General assent is 



THE DOCTRINE OF SAVING FAITH. 


335 


that by which the Gospel promises are regarded as true. 15) Special 
assent is that by which the individual believer regards the gracious 
promises of the Gospel as applying to him personally. 16) Saving 
faith is always fides actualis, that is, an active confiding on the 
part of the believer in the grace of God. 

All these terms express truths that should be kept in mind 
in connection with the doctrine of saving faith. Let the student, 
however, remember that some of these terms have not always been 
used in precisely the same sense, so that their definitions as given 
by different dogmaticians may vary.

CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OP FAITH. 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL 
OF FAITH. 

(De Conversions.) 


1. SCRIPTURAL BASIS OF THE DOCTRINE. 

According to the express teaching of Holy Scripture it is im¬ 
possible for fallen man to satisfy the demands of divine justice 
and to atone for his transgressions by good works, Ps. 49, 7. 8; 
Matt. 16,26. On the contrary, all who seek to appease Ood by the 
works of the Law remain under the curse and condemnation of 
the divine Law, Gal. 3,10. In fact, man by nature is so blinded 
and corrupted by sin, 1 Cor. 2,14; Eph. 2,1, that his carnal heart 
is enmity against God, Rom. 8, 7, and therefore unable rightly to 
love and worship Him, 1 Cor. 10, 20; Eph. 2,12. Man by nature 
is thus incapable of saving himself, Rom. 3,10—20. 

However, what man was unable to do God in His infinite 
mercy has accomplished for him, Rom. 8, 3. 4. Through the most 
perfect obedience of His beloved Son, Gal. 4, 4. 6; Is. 53, 4—6, He 
has reconciled the world unto Himself, 2 Cor. 5,19; 1 John 2,2, 
and since He has blotted out the handwriting of the Law which 
was against sinful mankind, Col. 2, 13. 14, He now offers to all 
sinners the merits of Christ through the means of grace (the Gospel 
and the Sacraments), earnestly desiring (vocatio seria) that all 
men should accept the most gracious forgiveness which He offers in 
Christ Jesus, 2 Cor. 5, 20. 21. This is the Scriptural basis of the 
•doctrine of conversion. In other words, conversion is possible only 
because Christ by His suffering and death has secured salvation 
for lost mankind, John 1, 29, and because God in His indescribable 
grace offers this salvation to all sinners as a free gift, Eph. 2, 8. 9. 

2. THE SCRIPTURAL DEFINITION OF CONVERSION. 

(De Forma Conversionis.) 

Conversion ( conversio, imozgoyt}, fuzavoia) does not consist 
in a person’s attempt to make amends for his sins and to appease 
the wrath of God by works; nor is it mere sorrow (contritio) over, 
or disgust at, sin or a solemn resolution on the part of man to 
improve his life by good works; for all these things even the un¬ 
converted may do, Matt. 27, 3. 4; 1 Sam. 24,16—22. But conver¬ 
sion is essentially the bestowal of faith (donatio fidei) in the 
divine promise of salvation for Christ’s sake upon a sinner who 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


337 


from the divine Law has learned to know and lament his sins, 
Mark 1,14.15. 

This is the true Scriptural definition of conversion as it is 
described in Acts 11, 21: “A great number believed and turned 
unto the Lord” (noAvg re dgi&fxoe 6 mozevoag Ineozgeipev ini z6v 
xvqiov). The turning to God, or conversion, of the great number, 
as here related, was accomplished by faith in “the preaching of 
the Lord Jesus,” v. 20. That is to say, the Lord Jesus was 
preached; a great number believed the Gospel of Christ and thus 
turned unto the Lord. 

In accord with this and other passages, John 1, 45—50; Acts 
8, 34—38; 16, 30—34, Luther defines conversion as follows: “To 
convert oneself to God means to believe that Christ is our Mediator 
and that we have eternal life through Him.” (Cp. St. L., XIII, 
1101; Y, 590. Pieper, Christl. Dogmatik, II, 545ff.) So also our 
dogmaticians declare that conversion takes place in that moment 
when the Holy Spirit engenders faith in the heart of the penitent 
sinner. Hollaz describes conversion as “the act of grace by which 
the Holy Spirit excites in the sinner sincere grief for his sins by 
the Word of the Law and enkindles true faith in Christ by the 
Word of the Gospel.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 466.) 

In short, a person is truly converted only when he believes that 
God has graciously forgiven his sins for Christ’s sake; or we may 
say: A converted person is a true believer in the divine-human 
Christ, the only Savior from sin. For this reason we must reject 
all definitions which identify conversion with a mere “change of 
min d” or with a mere “moral improvement of life” (reformatio 
vitae) as these have been given by ancient and modern rationalists 
(Pelagians, Unitarians, Modernists, etc.). We readily admit that 
also an unconverted person may improve his life externally 
(iustitia civilis), that he may suppress this or that vice and culti¬ 
vate this or that virtue, 1 Tim. 5, 8; but unless a person penitently 
receives the grace of God offered to him in Christ Jesus, he re¬ 
mains spiritually lost in spite of such change of conduct, Luke 18, 
10—14. His outward “good works” will be duly rewarded in this 
life (in regno potentiae); but since he is outside the Kingdom 
of Grace (regnum gratiae), he is without God, Eph. 2, 12, and 
without hope of salvation, Mark 16, 15. 16. To this truth the 
whole Bible bears witness. Luther: “God does not desire to be 
gracious to any people, either Jew or Gentile, unless they are con- 

CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 22 



338 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


verted, that is to say, unless they believe God with all their heart.” 
(St. L., Ill, 1697.) 

Because the Scriptural doctrine of conversion is of such emi¬ 
nent importance, it must be guarded against all error. To this end 
the Christian theologian must not only rule out all unscriptural 
doctrine on this point, but he must see to it that the terminology 
which he employs is in agreement with Scripture. Let him there¬ 
fore consider the following points from the outset: — 

a. Any teaching which makes of conversion a meritorious work, 
performed by man (papists: penance; Unitarians: a moral change) 
or the product of man’s power, either in whole or in part (Pela- 
gianism, synergism), destroys the Christian faith and frustrates the 
sinner’s conversion and justification. 

b. The two essential elements in conversion are contrition and 
faith, Mark 1, 16; Acts 16, 30. 31; Jer. 3, 13. 14. Contrition 
(terrores console ntiae), however, does not form the beginning of, 
or one half of, conversion, nor does it produce a better spiritual 
condition in the sinner; the terrified sinner hates God all the more 
because of his knowledge of sin and flees from Him. Contrition 
belongs to conversion only for the reason that faith cannot find 
entrance into the proud and secure heart; it is “the indispensable 
preparation for conversion.” Contrition is the effect of the preach¬ 
ing of the Law, which by itself cannot save a single sinner. 
Gal. 2,16. (Cf. the contrition of Judas, Matt. 27, 3—5.) 

c. Pietists and Methodists demand a fixed degree of contrition; 
but what is required is “that a person not only dreads the temporal 
effects of his sins, but also regards himself as lost forever on account 
of his sins, Luke 18,13.” 

d. Even the kindling of the first spark of faith in the sinner’s 
heart, or his longing after the grace of God in Christ, constitutes 
conversion. (Cf. Formula of Concord, Thor. Decl., II, 64. 14.) 

e. Conversion in a wider sense embraces sanctification, which 
is the inevitable result of conversion in the narrow sense (donatio 
fidei). Much confusion and error has been caused by not keeping 
the two uses of the term separate. 

f. The Scriptural doctrine of conversion is perverted 1) by the 
papists (conversion through man’s voluntary reception of grace 
and its gifts, by which the unjust man becomes a just man); 
2) by all rationalists (Unitarians, Modernists), who define con¬ 
version as the “moral reformation” of the sinner; 3) by the 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


339 


synergists, who condition God’s forgiveness on faith as an “ethical 
act”; and 4) by all errorists who make the hatred of sin and the 
purpose to amend one’s life the constitutive element of conversion 
or who (Pietists, Methodists) claim that sorrow for sin from love 
toward God moves God to be gracious. 

g. Conversion does not take place by stages, or degrees, but 
instantaneously; for while the preparation for conversion (motus 
praeparatorii which are chiefly the terrors of conscience, wrought 
by the Law) may extend over a period of time, conversion proper, 
or the kindling of faith, is effected in a moment. There is no 
intermediary state (status medius) in which man is semidead or 
semiliving, John 3,18. The synergists advocate the intermediary 
state, progressive, or successive, conversion, for the purpose of intro¬ 
ducing at some stage of the process man’s cooperation. On the 
other hand, all enthusiasts (Pietists, Methodists) go beyond Scrip¬ 
ture in denying that one is genuinely converted who cannot fix the 
exact moment of his conversion. 

h. The term repentance is sometimes used for contrition and 
faith (conversion) and sometimes for contrition alone. — In Chris¬ 
tians, repentance (conversio continuata, poenitentia stantium) con¬ 
tinues until death because of the evil which is ever present with 
them, Bom. 7, 21; Heb. 12,1. The believer therefore turns daily 
with a contrite heart to the Gospel of the forgiveness of sins. 
Perfectionism denies this continued conversion. Matt. 18, 3. 

i. The conversion of those who had fallen from grace (David, 
Peter; Jer. 3,12; John 3, 7; Gal. 4,19) is identical with the first 
conversion. The Calvinists, who, contrary to Luke 8, 13; Matt. 
12, 43ff.; Gal. 5, 4; 1 Tim. 1, 20; 1 Cor. 9, 27; 10,12, teach that 
true believers can never lose faith, do not acknowledge renewed 
conversion (conversio reiterata, poenitentia lapsorum) and there¬ 
fore prevent it. The same is true of Perfectionism. 

j. Conversion is not a substantial change, that is, not the crea¬ 
tion of a new essence of the soul (Flacius, Weigel), but the com¬ 
plete transformation of the soul, or the creation of new qualities 
in man, 2 Cor. 5,17; Ps. 51,10. To teach the latter, does not 
mean to teach mysticism (rationalists), but to affirm the true doc¬ 
trine of Holy Scripture on conversion. 

k. Conversion is not a mechanical action; for in conversion 
God works in man as in a rational creature and not as in a “stone 
or block” (Formula of Concord), Joel 2,12. 



840 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


l. Conversion is not by coercion; that is to say, God does 
not convert a person against his will (by irresistible grace: Cal¬ 
vinism) ; for conversion consists in this, that “God makes willing 
persons out of the unwilling” (Augustine; Formula of Concord, 
Epit., II, 15). 

m. Our Confession rightly condemns as expressions that “do 
not conform to the form of sound doctrine” the following: “God 
draws, but He draws the willing”; “In conversion the will of man 
is not idle, but also effects something”; and: “Only be willing, 
and God will anticipate you” ( Formula of Concord, Thor. Decl., 
II, 86). In accord with Scripture it describes the divine action in 
conversion as a “drawing of the Holy Ghost” (Thor. Decl., II, 88), 
John 6,44; 12,32. 

n. In conversion man is only the subiectum patiens, or the 
subiectum convertendum; that is to say, man “does or works 
nothing, but only suffers” ( Formula of Concord, Thor. Deck, 
11, 89.90). 

o. Against synergism our Confession declares on the basis of 
Scripture: “Before the conversion of man there are only two effi¬ 
cient causes, namely, the Holy Ghost and the Word of God, as 
the instrument of the Holy Ghost, by which He works conversion.” 
{Formula of Concord, Epit., II, 19.) 

Some of these points will be considered at greater length later 
on under their proper heads. We group them here in order to 
show how necessary it is to guard the Scriptural doctrine of 
conversion against error and to point out how essential it is to 
define conversion correctly. (Cf. Christl. Dogmatik, II, 542 ff.; 
Dr. Engelder, Dogmatical Notes.) 

3. THE STARTING-POINT AND THE TERMINUS 
OF CONVERSION. 

(Terminus a quo; Terminus ad quern ConTersionis.) 

Since conversion consists essentially in the bestowal of faith 
in Christ, it is obvious that the terminus a quo of conversion is 
unbelief, while its terminus ad quern is true confidence in Christ 
Jesus, Acts 26, 18: Intorgeyai Ajio oxozovs els <p<os; 2 Cor. 3, 
14—16. Quenstedt: Conversio prime est infidelium, ... et sic 
notat conversionem ab infidelitate ad fidem. 

Only then is a sinner converted when in place of infidelity, 
which by nature is found in every human heart, 1 Cor. 2,14, there 
is found in him faith in the gracious promises of God for Christ's 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


341 


sake (propter Christum). As long as a person is without faith 
in Christ, he is unregenerate, or unconverted, no matter whether 
in the sight of man he is a criminal or a saint, an illiterate or 
a sage. Upon all who are without Christ, Scripture pronounoes 
the verdict that they are without God in this world and have no 
hope, Eph. 2,12. 

However, as soon as a person believes in Christ, his conversion, 
or return to God, has been fully accomplished, even though his 
faith should be a mere spark (scintillula). Of all who believe in 
Christ, St. Paul writes: “But now in Christ Jesus ye who some¬ 
time were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ,” Eph. 2,13. 
According to these words it is faith in Christ that distinguishes 
those who are “far off,” or the unregenrate, from those who ar > 
“made nigh,” or the regenerate. In other words, as the apost e 
clearly teaches, conversion takes place through faith in the blood 
of Christ. 

Unless this truth is constantly borne in mind, it is impossible 
to avoid the mistake of regarding the unconverted as converted, 
or vice versa, the converted as unconverted. 

Properly speaking, the starting-point of conversion is unbelief, 
its terminus, saving faith in Christ, and its essential feature, the 
kindling of faith (donatio fidei). However, since unbelief is always 
joined with spiritual darkness, the dominion of Satan, idolatry, 
the state of sin, etc., also these factors may be said to constitute 
the starting-point of conversion. On the other hand, faith is 
always joined with spiritual life, communion with God, the keep¬ 
ing of the divine commandments, etc., and therefore also these 
things may be said to be the terminus of conversion. Thus Scrip¬ 
ture itself speaks of conversion as a turning from darkness to light, 
from the power of the devil to God, Acts 26,18, from idolatry to 
the worship of the living God, Acts 14, 15; 1 Thess. 1, 9, from 
transgression to the keeping of the divine Law, Ezek. 18, 21, etc. 

In all these passages unbelief and faith are described according 
to their outward manifestation, or fruits, so that we may rightly 
say: All who are in spiritual darkness, or under the dominion of 
Satan, or in the power of sin, or in the thraldom of idolatry are 
unconverted, while those who have spiritual life, are in communion 
with God, and possess new spiritual powers to keep the command¬ 
ments of God are truly converted. But it must not be forgotten 
that to be converted, in its proper and narrow sense, always means 
to come to faith in the Gospel of Christ, the Savior of sinners. 



342 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


Acts 11, 20. 21; 1 Pet. 2, 25, whereas spiritual life, communion 
with God, and the keeping of the divine commandments are, prop¬ 
erly speaking, fruits, or effects, of conversion. A person truly 
performs the will of God only after his will has been inclined, or 
turned, to God through faith in Christ, in other words, after he 
has been converted,. 

4. THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF CONVERSION. 

(Causa Efflciens Principalis Conversionis.) 

The question concerning the efficient cause of conversion has 
been answered in three different ways. In the first place, it has 
been said that man himself is the cause of his conversion (Pela- 
•,ianism). Again, it has been claimed that both God and man 
cooperate in bringing about the conversion of man, the sinner either 
beginning the work and God completing it (Semi-Pelagianism, 
Arminianism), or God making the beginning and the enlightened 
and awakened sinner himself completing it (synergism). 

With regard to Semi-Pelagianism and synergism the Formula 
of Concord says (Epitome, II, 10.11) : “We reject also the error 
of the Semi-Pelagians, who teach that man by his own powers can 
make a beginning of his conversion, but without the grace of the 
Holy Ohost cannot complete it; also, when it is taught that, 
although man by his free will before regeneration is too weak to 
make a beginning and by his own powers to turn himself to God 
and from the heart to be obedient to God, yet, if the Holy Ghost, 
by the preaching of the Word, has made a beginning and therein 
offered His grace, then the will of man from its own natural powers 
can add something [synergism], though little and feebly, to this 
end, can help and cooperate, qualify and prepare itself for grace, 
and embrace and accept it, and believe the Gospel. ,, According to 
this clear, decisive statement the Lutheran Confession on the basis 
of Scripture rejects both Pelagianism and synergism and supplies 
a third answer to the question concerning man’s conversion, namely, 
Ood alone is the efficient Cause of conversion (divine monergism), 
while the sinner (subiectum convertendum) conducts himself mere, 
or pure, passive. 

Of this the Formula of Concord says (Thor. Decl., II, 87) : 
“The conversion of our corrupt will, which is nothing else than 
a resuscitation of its spiritual death, is only and solely the work 
of God, just as the resuscitation in the resurrection of the body 
must be ascribed to God alone, as has been fully set forth above 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


343 


and proved by manifest testimonies of Holy Scripture.” The doc¬ 
trine of conversion here set forth is that of Holy Scripture, which 
teaches expressly that, if a sinner is converted, this is due, not to 
any efforts of his own, but alone to the effectual working of divine 
grace, Eph. 1, 19. The Scriptural proof for this truth may be 
stated as follows: — 

a. Scripture positively ascribes conversion, or the engendering 
of faith in man’s heart, exclusively to God, John 6, 44; Bom. 1, 
5—7; Col. 1,12. 13; in particular, to His grace, Phil. 1, 29; Eph. 
2, 8. 9, and omnipotent power, Eph. 1,19; 2 Cor. 4, 6. Moreover, 
it depicts conversion as a new birth from God, John 1, 12. 13; 
1 John 5, 1, or a spiritual resurrection, Col. 2, 12. 13. All these 
passages describe conversion as an act of divine grace (monergism) 
and exclude from it man’s operation or cooperation. 

b. Scripture expressly denies to unconverted man the power 
to know or to believe the Gospel, 1 Cor. 2, 14; John 6, 44, and 
charges him with the offense of resisting the good and gracious 
will of God, which earnestly desires his regeneration, up to the 
very moment when he is converted, 1 Cor. 2,14; Rom. 8, 7. Hence 
also these passages describe conversion as an act of divine grace 
and exclude from it man’s operation or cooperation. Both posi¬ 
tively and negatively Scripture therefore declares itself for divine 
monergism and against all forms of Pelagianism and synergism. 
Luther: “We rightly honor God if we acknowledge that we are 
not saved by our merits and put our trust in His mercy.” (St. L., 
XI, 2217.) 

That God alone is the efficient Cause of conversion is clear 
also from the very nature of conversion (forma conversion^ ). As 
we have seen, conversion consists essentially in this, that the terri¬ 
fied and penitent sinner believes in Christ and with such faith 
indeed as strenuously repudiates all work-righteousness and trusts 
for salvation in nothing else than in the merits of Christ. But 
such faith in Christ implies a complete and absolute change of 
the sinner’s heart and mind. By nature man is addicted to work¬ 
righteousness and desires no other way of salvation than that of 
relying on his good works. 

But if that is the case, then the change in his heart by which 
he repudiates all works and clings alone to Christ’s merits cannot 
come from man; for by nature he detests and opposes the 
Gospel way of salvation, 1 Cor. 2, 8.14; 1,23. The change must 
therefore be of God, as indeed it is. The Apology writes correctly 



344 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


(Art. Ill, 144ff.): “This opinion of the Law inheres by nature 
in men’s minds; neither can it be expelled, unless when we are 
divinely taught. But the mind must be recalled from such carnal 
opinions to the Word of God.” 

Against the Scriptural doctrine that God alone works and 
effects conversion it has been claimed that man by nature is indeed 
unable to believe the Gospel, to desist from opposing the Holy 
Spirit, to prepare himself for grace, and to observe a proper con¬ 
duct toward the calling and sanctifying operation of God; but this, 
it is claimed, he certainly can do as soon as he is endowed with 
spiritual powers. 

To this objection we reply that, if a person is able to do these 
spiritual works with powers granted to him by the Holy Ghost, 
he is already converted; for in that case his heart is completely 
changed, his will is conformed to God and divine things, his mind 
no longer regards the Gospel as foolishness, but as divine wisdom, 
and the crucified Savior, the world’s only spiritual Hope, is no 
longer a stumbling-block to him. In other words, in that case 
man exhibits every characteristic of a converted person, or of 
a believer. 

Of the unregenerate, or unconverted, the Formula of Concord 
rightly declares (Thor. Decl., II, 7): “The natural free will ac¬ 
cording to its perverted disposition and nature is strong and active 
only with respect to what is displeasing and contrary to God.” Of 
conversion it says (ibid., § 83) : “Conversion is such a change 
through the oj oration of the Holy Ghost in the intellect, will, and 
heart of man that by this operation of the Holy Ghost man can 
accept the offered grace.” Our Confession thus supports the Scrip¬ 
tural doctrine that the endowment of a person with spiritual powers 
is the very essence of conversion. (Donatio virium spirituaXium 
est ipsa conversio.) 

That God alone is the efficient Cause of conversion is the 
proper scope of Article II of the Formula of Concord. As it cor¬ 
rectly points out, man with respect to his conversion is not active, 
but pure passivus (purely passive), that is, “he does nothing what¬ 
ever towards it, but only suffers what God works in him” (Thor. 
Decl., II, 89). (Hominem in conversions sua pure passive sese 
habere, id est, pati id, quod Deus in ipso agit. . . .) In other words, 
man’s capacity for conversion must be regarded as entirely passive 
(capacitas passiva, non capacitas activa). His spiritual coopera¬ 
tion therefore begins only after he has been converted. 



CONVERSION, OB THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


345 


Our Confession says (Thor. Decl., II, 90): “The intellect and 
will of the unregenerate man are nothing else than svbiectum con- 
vertendum, that is, that which is to be converted, it being the 
intellect and will of a spiritually dead man in whom the Holy 
Ghost works conversion and renewal, toward which work man’s 
will that is to be converted does nothing, but suffers God alone to 
work in him, until he is regenerate; and then he works also with 
the Holy Ghost that which is pleasing to God in other good works 
that follow.” 

Hence there are not three efficient causes of conversion (tres 
causae efficientes conversion^), namely, the Holy Spirit, the Word, 
and the assenting will of man, as Melanehthon and his synergistic 
followers erroneously affirmed, but only two, the Holy Spirit and 
the Word of God. In his conversion man is like a block or stone, 
indeed, much worse than a block or stone, since by reason of his 
natural enmity against God, 1 Cor. 2,14; Bom. 8, 7, he resists the 
operations of the Holy Spirit until he is converted. 

The Formula of Concord says of this (Thor. Decl., II, 59) : 
“A stone or block does not resist the person who moves it, nor does 
it understand, and is sensible of, what is being done with it, as man 
with his will so long resists God the Lord until he is converted. . . . 
He can do nothing whatever towards his conversion . . . and is in 
this respect much worse than a stone and block; for he resists the 
Word and will of God, until God awakens him from the death of 
sin, enlightens and renews him.” 

It is true, conversion does not take place without a complete 
inner change of the heart; for the sinner experiences the terrors 
of conscience (terrores conscientiae), and through the operation of 
the Holy Spirit he believes the Gospel, which formerly, in his 
state of unbelief, he rejected. But neither the effects of the Law 
upon his heart nor his faith in the Gospel promises are due to his 
own efforts; for over against both the Law and the Gospel he is 
purely passive and only suffers “what God works in him” (ibid., 
§89). “Man of himself, or from his natural powers, cannot do 
anything or help towards his conversion, and . . . conversion is not 
only in part, but altogether an operation, gift, present, and work 
of the Holy Ghost alone, who accomplishes and effects it by His 
power and might, through the Word.” (Ibid.) 

In these clear and unmistakable words the Formula of Concord 
defends divine monergism against synergism. Its doctrine is: 



346 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


"Conversion is alone the work of the Holy Ghost, who operates by 
means of the Word of God.” (Solus Deus convertit hominem.) 

To the charge that our Confession rather overemphasizes this 
point, we reply that the writers of the Formula of Concord were 
fully persuaded that the adoption of synergism by the Lutheran 
Church would completely destroy the foundation of the Reforma¬ 
tion and lead the purified Church back to Pelagianism, the funda¬ 
mental error of the Papacy. A synergistic Lutheran Church, they 
perceived, could not teach the sola gratia in its Scriptural truth 
and purity. Hence, when they warded off the attacks of the 
synergists, they fought against foes who "flew at the throat” of 
Christianity. (Cp. Luther's words addressed to Erasmus: "Unus 
tu et solus cardinem rerum vidisti et ipsum iugulum petisti.” Also 
Dr. P. Bente’s statement: "Genuine Lutheranism would have been 
strangled if synergism had emerged victorious from this great con¬ 
troversy of grace versus free will.” Concordia Triglotta, Histor. 
Introd., p. 128.) 

5. THE MEANS OF CONVERSION. 

(Causae InstrumentaleB Conversionls.) 

Though God alone is the Cause of conversion, yet He does not 
convert men immediately, or by immediate operation, but through 
definite, ordained means. This truth our Lutheran Confession 
maintains against all forms of enthusiasm (Calvinism, Anabap- 
tism, etc.). The Formula of Concord declares (Thor. Decl., II, 4): 
"Moreover, both the ancient and modern enthusiasts have taught 
that God converts men and leads them to the saving knowledge of 
Christ through His Spirit, without any created means and instru¬ 
ment, that is, without the external preaching and hearing of 
God’s Word.” 

In these words the Formula of Concord points out the 
means by which the Holy Spirit works conversion, or regeneration, 
in the human heart, namely, by “the external preaching and hear¬ 
ing of God’s Word.” As aforesaid, conversion in its proper sense 
is nothing else than that a person, terrified by the Law on account 
of his sins, becomes a believer in Christ, trusting for salvation in 
the divine promises of the Gospel. The Gospel is therefore the 
object of converting faith; but it also is the means of conversion. 
Through the same means by which God offers to man the merits 
of Christ (vis evangelii dativa vel collativa) He also works in man 
faith in the proffered grace (vis evangelii effectiva vel operativa). 



CONVERSION, OS THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


347 


This truth is clearly taught in Holy Scripture, e. g., Rom. 
10, 17: “Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of 
■God”; Jas. 1,18: “Of His own will begat He us with the Word 
-of Truth”; 1 Thess. 1, 5: “Our Gospel came not unto you in word 
only, but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much as¬ 
surance”; 2 Thess. 2, 13. 14: “God hath chosen you to salvation 
through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, where- 
unto He called you by our Gospel”; 1 Thess. 2, 13: “Ye received 
the Word of God, . . . not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, 
the Word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that 
believe.” 

These passages prove that the Gospel is not a “dead letter,” 
but a living witness, full of power, John 6, 63, because the Holy 
Spirit is always active and operative through it to inscribe its 
divine promises into the human heart. Gal. 3,1—5; Rom. 1,16; 
Is. 65,11. 

Luther writes on this point: “Such is the efficacy of the Word 
whenever it is seriously contemplated, heard, and used that it is 
bound never to be without fruit, but always awakens new under¬ 
standing, pleasure, and devoutness and produces a pure heart and 
pure thoughts. For these words are not inoperative or dead, but 
creative, living words.” ( Large Catechism, Third Commandment, 
§ 100.) The Gospel is therefore the effective means by which the 
Holy Spirit works faith, or conversion, in man. 

Because the Gospel is connected with Baptism, Acts 2, 38, and 
the Lord’s Supper, Matt. 26, 26—28, also the Sacraments are effec¬ 
tive means (media salutis; Onadenmittel), through which the Holy 
Spirit either works faith (Baptism: Titus 3,5) or strengthens 
faith (Lord’s Supper: 1 Cor. 11, 26), in other words, through 
which He either converts sinners (infants) or confirms and pre¬ 
serves in faith those who are already converted (baptism of adults; 
Lord’s Supper). 

While the Gospel is the proper means by which the Holy Ghost 
works faith, or conversion, in man, the divine Law is used by God 
to prepare the sinner for conversion. Saving faith can never exist 
in a person who has not previously been convinced of his exceeding 
sinfulness and his state of wrath and damnation, Ps. 34, 18; 
51,17; Is. 66, 2; Acts 2, 37-^1; 16, 27—31. 

True repentance therefore comprises both contrition (con- 
tritio; terrores conscientiae), which is effected by the Law, and 
faith (fiducia), which is wrought by the Gospel. Hence, in order 



348 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


that sinners may be converted, the preaching of the Gospel must 
be preceded or accompanied by that of the Law, Horn. 3,19. 20. 
In other words, the proclamation of the Law and the Gospel must 
always go hand in hand, both in their proper connection and with 
the proper distinction of their functions and purposes, Luke 24,47. 

The Formula of Concord says (Thor. Decl., V, 24—26) : 
“These two doctrines [the Law and the Gospel], we believe, . . . 
should ever and ever be diligently inculcated in the Church of 
God, . . . although with the proper distinction of which we have 
heard, in order that through the preaching of the Law and its 
threats . . . the hearts of impenitent men may be terrified and 
brought to a knowledge of their sins and to repentance; but not 
in such a way that they lose heart and despair in this process, but 
that. . . they be comforted and strengthened again by the preaching 
of the holy Gospel concerning Christ, our Lord, namely, that to- 
those who believe the Gospel, God forgives all their sins through 
Christ, adopts them as children for His sake, and out of pure grace, 
without any merit on their part, justifies and saves them.” 

Hollaz writes in the same tenor: “Conversion, taken in 
a special sense [conversion proper], is that act of grace by which 
the Holy Spirit excites in the sinner sincere grief for his sins by 
the Word of the Law and kindles true faith in Christ by the Word 
of the Gospel that he may obtain remission of sins and eternal 
salvation.” ( Doctr . Theol ., p. 466.) 

The preaching of the Law is supported and furthered also by 
the crosses and afflictions, Luke 15, 14—18; Acts 16, 26—30; 
Ps. 119, 71, which come upon men and by the manifold earthly 
blessings by which God calls sinners to repentance, Rom. 2, 4. For 
this reason the peculiar dealings of God with men have been called 
concio legis realis, that is, a preaching of the Law by act. How¬ 
ever, neither the manifestation of God’s wrath nor of His goodness 
may take the place of the preaching of the divine Word; for this 
alone is the means through which the Holy Ghost operates in man 
toward his conversion, Mark 16,15.16. 

To the objection that divine monergism in conversion makes 
the use of external means unnecessary (Calvinism, enthusiasm) 
we reply that divine monergism certainly excludes human coopera¬ 
tion, but not the employment of the divinely appointed means. 

Of this the Formula of Concord writes (Thor. Decl., II, 46): 
“This doctrine concerning the inability and wickedness of our 
natural free will and concerning our conversion and regeneration. 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


349 


namely, that it is a work of God alone and not of our powers, is 
abused in an unchristian manner both by enthusiasts and Epi¬ 
cureans; ... for they say that, since they are unable from their 
own natural powers to convert themselves to God, they will always 
strive with all their might against God or wait until God converts 
them by force against their will; or since they can do nothing in 
these spiritual things, but everything is the operation of God the 
Holy Ghost alone, they will regard, hear, or read neither the Word 
nor the Sacrament, but wait until God, without means, instils 
into them His gifts from heaven, so that they can truly feel and 
perceive in themselves that God has converted them.” Luther: 
“Deus non dat interna nisi per externa. Spiritum Sanctum non 
mittit absque Verbo 

6. THE INTERNAL MOTIONS IN CONVERSION. 

(Motus Internl, quibus Conversio Absolvitur.) 

Whenever a sinner is converted to God, distinct motions, or 
movements, occur in his heart. In the first place, alarmed on 
account of his sins, which the divine Law has made known to him, 
Rom. 3, 20, he experiences the terrors of conscience (terrores con- 
scientiae), that is, true fear and anguish of heart. Acts 16, 29. 30. 
The terrors of conscience (terrores incussi conscientiae agnito pec- 
cato), though necessary, are not meritorious in themselves, Matt. 
27, 3—5. In spite of his knowledge of sin and the wrath of God 
the alarmed sinner, as long as he hears nothing of the Gospel, 
remains unconverted. However, when the Gospel is preached to 
him, the Holy Spirit engenders in his heart true faith (fiducia 
cordis) in the gracious promises of forgiveness, and it is through 
this second motion, that is, through implicit trust in Christ, that 
he is converted, Acts 16, 31—34. 

These two motions, contrition and faith, are found in every 
person who is truly converted, Ps. 32,1—5. Where they do not 
occur, genuine conversion has not taken place. 

The Formula of Concord writes (Thor. Decl., II, 70): “In 
genuine conversion a change, new emotion, and movement in the 
intellect, will, and heart must take place, namely, that the heart 
perceive sin, dread God’s wrath, turn from sin, perceive and accept 
the promise of grace in Christ, have good spiritual thoughts, 
a Christian purpose and diligence, and strive against the flesh. 
For where none of these occurs or is present, there is also no true 
conversion ." 



350 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


However, where contrition and faith are present in the heart,, 
there conversion has taken place, even though the believer’s knowl¬ 
edge of sin and his trust in divine grace are yet weak. Scripture 
nowhere demands a specific degree of contrition or faith, though,, 
of course, the regenerate should strive to grow in knowledge of 
both sin and grace, Col. 1, 9—11; 2 Pet. 3,18. True contrition 
may be said to exist in every case where a penitent sinner regards- 
himself as eternally lost on account of his sins, Acts 16, 30. 

True love of God is not a part of contrition; love is a fruit of 
faith, Gal. 5, 22, or the effect of conversion. But saving faith exists 
in the heart as soon as the penitent sinner longs for, or desires, 
divine grace in Christ Jesus, that is to say, as soon as he has a mere 
spark of faith (scintillula fidei), as Holy Scripture clearly teaches. 
Is. 42, 3; Mark 9,24. The Formula of Concord says (Thor. Decl.,. 
II, 14): “To all godly Christians who feel and experience in their 
hearts a small spark or longing for divine grace and eternal sal¬ 
vation this precious passage [Phil. 2,13] is very comforting; for 
they know that God has kindled in their hearts this beginning of 
true godliness and that He will further strengthen and help them 
in their great weakness to persevere in true faith unto the end.”' 

7. CONVERSION IS INSTANTANEOUS. 

(Conversio Momentanea Est.) 

In the discussion of the subject of conversion the question 
whether conversion is successive (conversio succession) or instan¬ 
taneous (conversio momentanea) has been given much considera¬ 
tion. Since conversion takes place through the kindling of faith 
in the heart by the Holy Ghost, it is clear that it occurs in 
a moment (conversio momentanea), namely, in that moment whern 
the Holy Spirit through the means of grace engenders faith in 
the contrite sinner. Hence, as soon as the penitent sinner pos¬ 
sesses the first spark or longing of faith, he is already fully con¬ 
verted. (Conversio temporis momento fit, . . . veluti h gtnjj 
8/j./j.azoc. Calov.) 

Conversion may be said to be successive (conversio succession) 
only in case certain acts (actus praeparatorii) which commonly 
precede it are regarded as a part of conversion. To these actus 
praeparatorii belong the inculcation of the divine Law, the con¬ 
viction of the sinner of his guilt and condemnation, the incitement 
of the terrores conscientiae, and the like. Properly speaking, how- 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


351 


ever, these acts of the Holy Ghost only prepare the sinner for con¬ 
version, but do not convert him; for conversion, properly speaking, 
occurs only in that moment when the Holy Spirit through the 
Gospel changes the alarmed and despairing sinner into a rejoicing 
believer in Christ. 

For this reason we must not speak of a middle state (status 
medius) between conversion and non-conversion (homo renascens, 
homo in statu medio constitutus), since this is both unscriptural 
and synergistic. It is unscriptural; for Holy Scripture recognizes 
only two classes of men, the converted and the unconverted, or 
what is the same, believers and unbelievers, John 3,18. 36; Mark 
16,16; 1 Pet. 2, 25. According to Scripture it is impossible for 
a person to be in a middle state even for a moment, for there is no 
middle ground between belief and unbelief, between life and death, 
Luke 11, 23. 

Theologians who in opposition to Scripture reject the instan¬ 
taneous character of conversion and explain it as a long-drawn-out 
process, during which the sinner is first enlightened, then awakened, 
and finally brought to the decision to accept Christ, commonly do 
so in the interest of synergism, that is to say, to support their 
erroneous views that the awakened sinner in the final analysis must 
convert himself with spiritual powers bestowed upon him by the 
Holy Ghost (Latermann). 

As a matter of fact, the objections of modern rationalistic 
theologians to the instantaneous character of conversion are really 
not directed against the conversio momentanea, but against the 
sola gratia; for synergistic rationalism regards conversion both as 
an act of divine grace and as an act of human meritorious effort. 
It champions the doctrine of “successive conversion” and of “the 
middle state” since according to its erroneous view God endows the 
sinner only with the potentiality, or ability, to believe and not 
with faith itself. Faith, it is claimed, is man’s own free, con¬ 
scious, and deliberate self-determination (Selhstbestimmung), ac¬ 
complished through spiritual powers granted to him by God. From 
this it is clear that the onslaught upon the Scriptural doctrine of 
instantaneous conversion is, in the last analysis, directed against 
divine monergism in conversion, or against the sola gratia. 

It goes without saying that what is here said of synergism is 
true also of Arminianism. Both insist upon successive conversion 
because both hold that man in the last instance must convert him- 



352 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


self. Hominis voluntas in conversions non est otiosa, sed agit 
aliquid. Against this error the Formula of Concord testifies 
(Thor. Decl., II, 62) : “No modus agendi, or no way whatever of 
working something good in spiritual things, can be ascribed to 
man before his conversion.” 

8. THE GRACE OF CONVERSION IS RESISTIBLE. 

(Gratia Conversionis Besistibilis Est.) 

Although the conversion of man is a work of God’s omnipotent 
power, Eph. 1,19; 2 Cor. 4, 6, divine converting grace nevertheless 
is not irresistible (gratia irresistibilis), as the Calvinists teach, but 
resistible (gratia resistibilis), as Holy Scripture affirms. Matt. 
23,37; Acts 7,51. The reason for this is evident. Though God 
is irresistible whenever He deals with man according to His sov¬ 
ereign power (in nuda maiestate), Matt. 25, 31. 32, He can be re¬ 
sisted whenever He exercises His omnipotent power through means. 
Matt. 11, 28; 23, 37. Both in His Kingdom of Power and in the 
Kingdom of Grace the means by which He purposes to bless man 
can be rejected. Thus life, the greatest of God’s earthly gifts, 
though created and sustained by divine omnipotence, can never¬ 
theless be destroyed by man. Similarly spiritual life, or conver¬ 
sion, though offered through the means of the omnipotent Word 
of God, can be rejected by man through malicious resistance. 

Maintaining the resistibility of converting grace (gratia con¬ 
versionis), the confessional Lutheran Church disavows both Cal¬ 
vinism and synergism. Denying the universality of grace, the 
Calvinists declare that the elect are regenerated by irresistible 
grace, while to the non-elect only common grace is granted. The 
synergists, on the other hand, conclude from the resistibility of 
grace that, as the sinner can reject the divine grace offered to him, 
so also he can cooperate with the Holy Spirit in his conversion, 
by rightly using the spiritual powers granted to him. Both errors 
are opposed to the clear teaching of Holy Scripture on this point, 
1 Tim. 2, 4; Phil. 2,13. 

9. TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE CONVERSION. 

(Conversio Transitive; Conversio Intransitive.) 

On the basis of Holy Scripture our dogmaticians speak of 
transitive and intransitive conversion (conversio transitiva; con¬ 
versio intransitiva) . In other words, God is said to convert man, 
and again, man is said to convert himself (Jer. 31, 18, 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 853 

Acts 3,19, fxezavorjoaTE; Jer. 24, 7, *3E*’). Between the two, how¬ 
ever, there is no real distinction (realis distinctio), since man con¬ 
verts himself only when God converts him. Both expressions 
therefore describe one and the same act, of which God alone is the 
efficient Cause. The expressions must therefore not be understood 
in the synergistic sense as though God began while man himself 
accomplished or completed conversion. While the expression “in¬ 
transitive conversion” (“Man converts himself”) is Scriptural, it 
must not be forgotten that in conversion God “worketh in man 
both to will and to do,” Phil. 2,13. 

Baier^ remark on the point is truly Scriptural. He writes: 
“The word conversion is taken in a double sense in the Scriptures, 
inasmuch as at one time God is said to convert man and at another 
that man is said to convert himself, although as to the thing itself 
(quoad rem) the action is one and the same (una et eadem)" That 
God alone works conversion is abundantly proved in Scripture, Jer. 
31,18; John 6, 44; Eph. 1,19; etc. These passages do not allow 
even a modified form of synergism (Man’s conversion depends on 
his necessary condition of passiveness and submissiveness toward 
the Gospel call; cp. Latermann, Dieckhoff, etc.). 

10. CONTINUED CONVERSION. 

(Conversio Con.ttn.uata.) 

On the basis of Scripture our dogmaticians speak also of 
continued conversion, that is, of that conversion which continues 
throughout the life of the believer, Matt. 18, 3. The need of con¬ 
tinued conversion is based upon the fact that the regenerate aTe 
not fully sanctified, but retain the Old Adam, Heb. 12,1; Bom. 
7, 21. 23, so that because of the sinfulness of their flesh and the 
manifold actual sins flowing therefrom they must live in “daily 
repentance,” Rom. 6, 3—6. It is this “daily repentance” with 
which “continued conversion” (continued regeneration, resuscita¬ 
tion, illumination) must be identified. (Poenitentia continuata sive 
quotidiana est dolor hominis iam conversi de residua ad peccandum 
proclivitate et vitiositate.) 

Holy Scripture distinguishes sharply between the first con¬ 
version (conversio prima) j by which the unregenerate becomes 
a believer in Christ, and the continued conversion (conversio 
secunda) of the believer, 1 Pet. 2, 25 (cp. also v. 10), which extends 
throughout his life, Ps. 51,1—12. The conversio prima is com¬ 
plete when the believer is endowed with the first spark of faith 

23 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



354 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


(scintillula fidei), while his conversio secunda is never complete 
as long as he lives in this world, Rom. 7, 24. In the first con¬ 
version man is purely passive (mere passivus), but in the second 
he cooperates with the Holy Ghost according to the "new man” 
(eoco dvidgcono?; xaivos &v&Q(onoe, Eph. 4, 24), implanted in him 
in his first conversion, Gal. 5,17. 24; Rom. 7, 22. 25. The second 
conversion must never be mingled with the first, as some synergists 
have done in the interest of denying the pure passive of the 
first conversion, by which the unregenerate becomes a believer. 
(Cp. Pieper, Christl. Dogmatik, II, 559ff.) 

11. REITERATED CONVERSION. 

(Conversio Reiter&ta.) 

It is a clear doctrine of Scripture that believers in Christ may 
fall from grace, or lose their faith, Luke 8,13.14; 1 Tim. 1,19. 
This is proved also by the examples of David and Peter. This 
truth must be emphasized over against the Calvinists, who affirm 
that believers, when committing mortal sins, lose indeed the exer¬ 
cise of faith (exercitium fidei), but not faith itself. 

Our Lutheran Confession strongly condemns this Calvinistic 
doctrine as unscriptural and pernicious. It says ( Smalcald Art., 
Ill, 42) : “If certain sectarists would arise . . . holding that all 
those who had once received the Spirit or the forgiveness of sins 
or had become believers, even though they should afterwards sin, 
would still remain in the faith and such sin would not harm them: 
... I have had before me many such insane men, and I fear that 
in some such a devil is still remaining.” On the other hand, it 
must be maintained that those who have fallen from faith may 
again be converted (conversio reiterata). (Poenitentia iterata 
lapsorum, qui ad meliorem frugem redeunt.) This truth we hold 
against the ancient Novatians and their modern followers. (Augsb. 
Conf., XII, 9.) 

However, when the sinner has committed the sin against the 
Holy Ghost, reiterated conversion is impossible. Matt. 12, 31—32; 
1 John 5,16. Since, however, man can only in rare cases definitely 
know who has committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, it is the 
duty of the Christian Church to preach repentance and faith to all 
men as it has opportunity, Ezek. 18, 23—32; 3,16—21. 

With regard to the Terministic Controversy, which occurredi 
in the Lutheran Church early in the 18th century and in which 
the Pietists, on the basis of such passages as Matt. 3,7 ff.; 7,21; 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


355 


20,1—16; 2 Pet. 2, 20; Heb. 6,4ff., defended “terminism,” that 
is, the doctrine that only a limited term (terminus peremptorius 
salutis) is accorded to an individual for salvation, while the ortho¬ 
dox Lutherans, on the basis of Luke 23, 40 ff.; Eom. 5, 20; Is. 
65, 2, affirmed that God desires the salvation of every sinner 
throughout his life and that, if there is a shortened term of grace 
(terminus gratiae peremptorius), this is due only to the sinner’s 
self-hardening against the means of grace, the rule just stated 
suffices: The Church should not withhold, but bestow, the grace 
of the Gospel as long as men are ready to receive it, Mark 16,15. 

12. OBJECTIONS AGAINST DIVINE MONERGISM 
IN CONVERSION. 

Among the numerous objections which have been raised against 
the Scriptural doctrine that God alone converts man (Solus Deus 
convertit hominem) the following deserve special notice: — 

a. Since Ood in His Word demands repentance, or conversion, 
of man (Acts 16, 31; Mark 1,15), he must be able, at least in part, 
to convert himself. To this we reply that from the divine demand 
no conclusion may be drawn with respect to man’s ability to comply 
with God’s will. A debito ad posse non valet consequents. 

On the contrary, the divine commands and exhortations are 
the means by which God works that which He demands. Thus 
through the commands of the Law (admonitiones legales) He 
humiliates man and works in him true knowledge of sin, Luke 
10,28; Eom. 3, 20, while through the Gospel exhortations (admo¬ 
nitiones evangelicae) He works in him true faith, Matt. 11, 28. As 
an analog of the divine method of working through His omnipotent 
Word that which He wills we may cite the resurrection of Lazarus, 
John 11, 43. 44 (cp. also Acts 3, 6) and the work of creation, 
Gen. 1, 3ff. Hence we must not reason: “Why command men to 
do what they are utterly unable to do? Why bid a man believe 
when he cannot?” but rather regard both the acmonitiones legales 
and the admonitiones evangelicae as the efficient means by which 
God accomplishes His beneficent purpose of saving sinners. That 
the synergistic argument A debito ad posse valet consequents is 
untenable Scripture clearly shows, Matt. 11, 28, cp. with John 6,44. 

With regard to the conditional clauses, Eom. 10, 9, it may be 
said that these point out, not real conditions, but the means by 
which God accomplishes man’s salvation. Thus the statement “If 



356 


CONVERSION, OB THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


thou shalt believe in thine heart, . . . thou shalt be saved,” means 
nothing else than “By faith thou shalt be saved.” 

b. Unless man cooperates in his conversion, his conversion be¬ 
comes an act of coercion (coactio), or force; in other words, in 
that case man is converted by irresistible grace, an assumption 
which Scripture condemns. To this we reply that this objection 
ignores the very nature of conversion, which consists in the divine 
act by which God through the means of grace changes the un¬ 
willing into such as are willing, John 6, 44. Conversion is not an 
act by which God thrusts upon the sinner what he does not desire 
or forces him to receive what he does not want, but it is a gracious 
divine drawing (John 6, 44: tkxvoji), by which He works in him 
“both to will and to do,” Phil. 2,13. Luther rightly remarks that 
God, in converting man, does not draw him as the hangman draws 
a criminal to the gallows, but by “softening and changing his heart” 
through the means of grace. “Es ist ein freundlich Loclcen und 
An-sich-Ziehen, wie sonst ein holdseliger Mann die Leute an sich 
ziehtr (St. L., VII, 2287ff.) 

c. Ood works the ability to believe, but not the act of faith, or 
He prepares man for conversion, but does not accomplish it, since 
the final decision rests with man himself. To this we reply that 
according to Holy Scripture the very act of faith is God’s work 
and gift, Phil. 1, 29; Eph. 1,19. 20; Phil. 2,13. We concede in¬ 
deed that God works in man the ability to believe, but as soon as 
this ability has been bestowed upon the sinner, he is no longer 
spiritually dead, but alive in Christ, or what is the same, then he 
is already converted. Spiritual death in that case has been re¬ 
moved, and in its place spiritual life has been implanted in 
the heart. 

So the Formula of Concord understands the well-known state¬ 
ment, which synergists so often have quoted in their favor (Thor. 
Ded., II, 83) : “Conversion is such a change through the operation 
of the Holy Ghosf in the intellect, will, and heart of man that by 
this operation of t le Holy Ghost man can accept the offered grace” 
(qua homo potest oblatam gratiam apprehendere). According to 
the Formula of Concord the person who “can accept the offered 
grace” is already regenerate; for it states definitely (Thor. Decl., 
II, 85) : “The man who is not regenerate resists God altogether 
and is entirely a servant of sin, John 8, 34; Rom. 6,16. The re¬ 
generate man, however, delights in the Law of God after the inward 
man.” Hence our Confession cannot be quoted as favoring the 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


357 


modified doctrine of the later synergists, who affirmed that man 
can convert himself by using rightly the new spiritual powers com¬ 
municated to him by God (Latermann, a disciple of George Calix- 
tus, f 1662), or what is the same, that he can convert himself after 
God has bestowed upon him the ability to believe. 

d. Unless man cooperates in his conversion, not he himself, 
but the Holy Spirit in him does the believing; in other words, in 
that case not man, but the Holy Ohost is the subject of faith. 
However, if this argument were correct, it would apply also to the 
natural life of man, for God “giveth to all life and breath,” Acts 
17, 25. Yet though God is the sole Author and Preserver of human 
life, Acts 17,28, every sane person agrees to the fact that man him¬ 
self lives, moves, works, eats, weeps, rejoices, etc.; in other words, 
that the life, movement, and activity of a person are his own. 

e. If man can resist divine grace and so hinder his salvation. 
Matt. 23, 27, then he can also assist divine grace and so make his 
salvation possible. Expressed more briefly, the argument reads: 
If man can damn himself, then he can also save himself. To this 
argument we reply that this conclusion does not follow. For while 
Scripture ascribes to man the power to destroy himself, Hos. 13, 9; 
Acts 7, 51, it emphatically denies that he can save himself, 1 Cor. 
2, 14; Rom. 8, 7; Phil. 2, 13. Hence from the statement “Ye 
would not” we must not conclude with respect to the regenerate 
“Ye would.” What is true in the realm of grace is true also in 
the realm of nature. Man by suicide can destroy his life, but the 
life so destroyed he is unable to restore. So in the realm of con¬ 
version there is no capacitas volendi corresponding to man’s capon 
citas nolendi. 

i. If man is unable to cooperate in his conversion, then con¬ 
version is not a “moral” process. In order to meet this argument 
properly, we must bear in mind that the expression “moral” is 
ambiguous. We admit that conversion is a “moral” act inasmuch 
as in conversion God does not deal with man as with an inanimate 
creature (a block or stone), but rather as with a personal moral 
being endowed with reason and will. Taken in this sense, con¬ 
version may indeed be called a moral process; for in conversion 
the Holy Spirit enlightens the intellect, changes the will, and 
sanctifies the heart. However, conversion is no “moral process” 
in the synergistic sense, that man in his conversion cooperates with 
divine grace toward his regeneration; for Scripture, on the one 
hand, denies to man any power to convert himself, 1 Cor. 2,14; 



358 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


John 6, 44; Eph. 2,1. 5, and, on the other, positively declares that 
God is the sole Cause of his conversion, Eph. 1, 19. 20; 2, 10; 
2 Cor. 4, 6; John 1,12.13. For this reason the Formula of Con¬ 
cord rightly affirms (Thor. Decl., II, 87) : “The conversion of our 
corrupt will, which is nothing else than a resuscitation of it from 
spiritual death, is only and solely the work of God, just as also the 
resuscitation in the resurrection of the body must be ascribed to 
God alone.” 

g. Conversion is a "free” process in man. (Homo libere se 
convertit.) To this argument we reply that, if the term “free” is 
used in opposition to coercion, its application to conversion is 
justified, because conversion is that act of God by which He changes 
the unwilling into willing. (Ex nolentibus gratiam volentes gra- 
tiam facit.) But the term “free” may not be applied to conversion 
in the synergistic sense, that man before conversion is “neutral,” 
so that he can decide either for or against grace (ut possit velle 
aut non). With regard to man’s relation to God and Hi9 kingdom 
there is no neutrality; for man is either with or against Christ, 
Matt. 12, 30; Luke 9, 50. Luther writes: “Here there is no 
middle road; for we are necessarily either under the strong tyrant 
the devil, in his captivity, or under the Redeemer Christ in 
heaven. . . . Hence every man lives either with Christ against the 
devil or with the devil against Christ.” (St. L., VII, 172.) 

h. Man can cooperate in his conversion since he is capable of 
civil righteousness (iustitia civilis, probitas naturalis). In answer 
to this argument we say that, while man by nature is indeed capable 
of civil righteousness (iustitia civilis), he is of himself incapable 
of spiritual righteousness (iustitia spiritualis). He may indeed 
refrain from gross sins outwardly, but inwardly he cannot truly 
love God nor rightly keep His commandments, since with all his 
external righteousness he does not believe the Gospel of Christ, 
but rather hates and resists it, 1 Cor. 2,14. The Pharisees gloried 
in their civil righteousness; yet Christ judged of them: “The 
publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you,” 
Matt. 21, 31. In spite of their “civil righteousness” the “princes 
of this world . . . crucified the Lord of Glory,” 1 Cor. 2, 8. Even to 
the <f best” Jews, Christ Crucified is a stumbling-block, and to the 
“best” Gentiles He is foolishness, 1 Cor. 1, 23, until they are con¬ 
verted, 1 Cor. 1, 24. 

i. Man is able to cooperate in his conversion since he can use 
the means of grace externally, that is, attend church, read the 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


359 


Bible, etc. We readily admit that man by nature can externally 
use the means of grace, as also the Formula of Concord declares 
(Thor. Deel., II, 53): “This Word man can externally hear and 
read, even though he is not yet converted to God and regenerate; 
for in these external things, as said above, man even since the 
Fall has to a certain extent a free will, so that he can go to church 
and hear or not hear the sermon.” Yet this external use of the 
means of grace does not presuppose any ability on the part of men 
to repent of their sins and believe in Christ; for even while they 
read or hear the Word, “the veil is upon their hearts,” 2 Cor. 3,15, 
which veil is “done away in Christ,” v. 14, that is, through faith in 
Christ, wrought by the Holy Spirit, vv. 16—18. 

j. If God alone works conversion in man, then it cannot be 
maintained that He really desires the salvation of all men; for. 
actually He does not convert all. To this we reply that Holy Scrip¬ 
ture teaches both the sola gratia and the gratia universalis; that is, 
God alone converts and saves sinners, and He earnestly desires to 
save all sinners. Both doctrines must therefore be taught side by 
side without any modification or qualification of either of them. 
It is true, if this is done, the theologian is confronted with the per¬ 
plexing problem, which human reason cannot solve, “Why, then, 
are not all saved?” (Cur alii, alii non? Cur alii prae aliisf) 
Calvinism solves the mystery by denying the universalis gratia; 
synergism, by denying the sola gratia, whereas the theologian who 
is loyal to Scripture does not attempt any solution of the mystery 
at all, just as little as he endeavors to solve the mysteries involved 
in the doctrines of the Holy Trinity, the personal union, the real 
presence, etc. Reason indeed argues thus: Since all men are in 
the same state of guilt (in eadem culpa) and only God, who 
earnestly desires to save all men (universalis gratia), can save 
sinners (sola gratia), the actual conversion of all men must needs 
follow. But the true theologian does not recognize reason as his 
principle of faith (principium cognoscendi) ; he is bound to Scrip¬ 
ture as the only source and rule of faith, which, however, does not 
explain this crux theologorum. 

Scripture indeed affirms that God is the sole Cause of man’s 
conversion and salvation, Phil. 2,13; Eph. 1,19. 20, and, on the 
other hand, that unregenerate man is the sole cause of his damna¬ 
tion, Matt. 23, 37; Acts 7, 51; Hos. 13, 9. But it does not explain 
why of two sinners who are in the same guilt (David, Saul; Peter, 
Judas) the one is saved and the other is not. For this reason we 



360 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


reject the argumentation of Melanchthon: “Since the promise is 
universal and there are no contradictory wills in God, it necessarily 
follows that there is in us a certain distinguishing cause (aliqua 
discriminis causa) why Saul is rejected and David accepted; that 
is, there is in these two a certain dissimilar action (aliqua actio 
dissimUis )” This synergistic explanation indeed satisfies human 
reason, for it explains why one is saved and another is lost; but it 
denies the sola gratia and thus repudiates the central doctrine of 
Scripture. 

The Formula of Concord clearly points out the true position 
which the theologian must take when he faces the mystery of elec¬ 
tion and conversion. It says (Thor. Decl., XI, 54—58): “Thus 
there is no doubt that God most exactly and certainly foresaw 
before the time of the world, and still knows, which of those that 
are called will believe or will not believe. . . . However, since God 
has reserved this mystery for His wisdom and has revealed nothing 
to us concerning it in His Word, much less commanded us to in¬ 
vestigate it with our thoughts, but has earnestly discouraged us 
therefrom, Rom. 11, 33ff., we should not reason in our thoughts, 
draw conclusions, nor inquire curiously into these matters, but 
should adhere to His revealed Word, to which He points us. . . . 
Likewise when we see . . . that one is hardened, blinded, given over 
to a reprobate mind, while another, who is indeed in the same 
guilt, is converted, etc., — in these and similar questions Paul 
(Eom. 11, 22 ff.) fixes a certain limit to us how far we should 
go, namely, that in the one part we should recognize God’s judg¬ 
ment (for He commands us to consider in those who perish the 
just punishment of God and the penalties of sins). For they are 
all well-deserved penalties of sins when God so punishes a land 
or nation for despising His Word that the punishment extends also 
to their posterity,” etc. 

13. THE PERNICIOUS CHARACTER OF SYNERGISM. 

While both the gross synergists (Melanchthon: “The assenting 
will of man is an efficient cause of conversion”) and the subtle 
synergists (Latermann, modern evangelical Protestantism in gen¬ 
eral : “Man’s will is able to decide for salvation through new powers 
bestowed by God”) profess to teach salvation by grace, they in 
reality disavow the Scriptural doctrine of salvation by grace and 
inculcate salvation by work-righteousness. Both the gross and the 
subtle synergists, in the final analysis, ascribe man’s salvation in 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


301 


part to his good conduct, his decision for Christ, his self-determina¬ 
tion, his omission of malicious resistance, etc. Hence synergism 
does not acknowledge the doctrine of grace in the sense of Scrip¬ 
ture and the Christian Church. On the contrary, it represents 
a return to the camp of Semi-Pelagianistic Romanism, which Lu¬ 
ther and the Reformers so ceaselessly and zealously condemned. 
(Cp. Luther’s address to Erasmus in reply to his Diatribe: “Unus 
tu et solus cardinem rerum vidisti et ipsum iugulum petisti ”) The 
Apology says (Art. Ill, 144): "Verum opera incurrunt hominibus 
in oculos. Haec naturaliter miratur Humana ratio, et quia tantum 
opera cemit, /idem non intelligit neque considerat, ideo somniat 
haec opera mereri remissionem peccatorum et iustificare. Haec 
opinio legis haeret naturaliter in animis hominum, neque excuti 
potest, nisi quum divinitus docemur.” 

However, since synergism denies the monergism of divine 
grace (sola gratia), it really renders the conversion of a sinner 
impossible, since man is saved solely by grace, through faith, with¬ 
out the deeds of the Law, Rom. 3, 24—28; Eph. 2,8. 9. Indeed, 
those who have been truly converted and have become children of 
God by trusting solely in Christ (sola fide) will fall from grace 
and lose their saving faith if they espouse the pernicious error of 
synergism. Gal. 5, 3. 4. 9.11.12. 

Lastly, synergism involves its champions in hopeless contra¬ 
dictions and creates endless doctrinal confusion in all circles in 
which it is insisted upon; for even while it affirms man’s coopera¬ 
tion in conversion, that is, his own efforts as necessary for regen¬ 
eration and salvation, it again stresses grace as the sinner’s only 
hope. Synergism is therefore an affirmation and a denial at the 
same time, a blending of grace and nature, which, consistently 
carried out, destroys “the central Christian truth of justification 
by grace alone and, with it, the assurance of a gracious God and 
of eternal salvation — the supreme religious concern of Luther and 
the entire Lutheran theology.” (Cp. Dr. F. Bente’s Historical 
Introduction on the Synergistic Controversy, Concordia Triglotta, 
p. 124 ff.) 

Synergism derives its doctrine “not from any clear statements 
of the Bible, but by a process of anti-Seriptural and fallacious 
reasoning” (ibid.) ; and it is all the more dangerous and pernicious 
since “it reduces man’s cooperation to a seemingly harmless min¬ 
imum and clothes itself in ambiguous phrases and apparently pious 
and plausible formulas” (ibid.). Its line of reasoning is: “Since 



362 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


all who are not converted or finally saved must blame, not God, 
but themselves for rejecting grace, those, too, who are converted 
must be credited with at least a small share in the work of their 
salvation, that is to say, with a better conduct toward grace than 
the conduct of those who are lost.” (Ibid.) This, however, in its 
final effect, overthrows the entire Gospel of free grace. It was for 
this reason that Luther and all confessional Lutherans so emphati¬ 
cally inculcated the monergism of divine grace. “The restoration 
of this wonderful truth, taught by St. Paul, made Luther the Re¬ 
former of the Church.” (Ibid.) 

Also in its modern subtle form, synergism teaches that con¬ 
version is the product, in part, of man’s natural powers; for it is 
the unconverted sinner who must make the right use of the new 
powers granted to him by grace, decide in favor of conversion, 
cease wilful resistance, and the like. In its most subtle form, 
synergism makes conversion hinge on the non-occurrence of wilful 
resistance in a given moment or on a favorable condition and the 
consequent good attitude and conduct of natural man. 

The theory that the Holy Ghost removes man’s natural resis¬ 
tance, but that the sinner himself must suppress all wilful resistance 
is Pelagianism pure and simple; for it ascribes spiritual powers to 
the unconverted. It is true, also dogmaticians like Gerhard, Quen- 
stedt, Calov, etc., used the unscriptural expression that election 
took place intuitu fidei ; but they repudiated the synergistic con¬ 
cept logically inherent in this phrase and taught that non-resistance 
is in no sense man’s own work, but rather the work of God, which 
unconverted man can only resist. (Cf. Dr. Pieper, Conversion and 
Election ; Dr. Engelder, Dogmatical Notes.) 

14. SYNONYMS OF CONVERSION. 

In order that the way of salvation (ordo salutis), so clearly 
and simply set forth in God’s Word, may be presented in its Scrip¬ 
tural purity and truth, the theologian must fully understand in 
what relation conversion stands to regeneration, vivifieation, re¬ 
suscitation, illumination, vocation, repentance, etc., all of which 
are terms which Scripture employs to describe the divine act of 
grace, by which the sinner is delivered from the power of darkness 
and translated into the kingdom of Christ, Col. 1,13. Actually all 
these terms, in their restricted sense, are synonyms of conversion, 
so that the distinction between them and conversion is only nom¬ 
inal, or logical, and not at all real. The difference which they 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OP FAITH. 


863 


represent lies only in the point of view from which they depict the 
sinner’s return to God. 

a. Regeneration (regeneratio). Regeneration in its strict sense 
describes the new birth, John 3, 5. 6, which the sinner undergoes 
in his conversion, or the bestowal of new spiritual life through faith 
in Christ. According to Scripture every person is born of God who 
believes that Jesus is Christ, 1 John 5,1. The term therefore in its 
proper application is synonymous with conversion, Acts 11, 21. 
Hence we may say that the sinner who is converted is also regen¬ 
erated, and vice versa, since the two terms designate one and the 
same act of the Holy Ghost, John 1,12.13. Luther writes: “Who¬ 
ever believes in Christ ... is born again, or born anew.” (St. L., 
VII, 1862.) 

The instrumental means of regeneration is the Word of God, 
in particular the Gospel of Christ, 1 Pet. 1, 23, as also Baptism, 
Titus 3, 5, since the latter is water “comprehended in God’s com¬ 
mand and connected with God’s word,” that is, with the gracious 
divine promise of remission of sins, Acts 2, 38. 

b. Vivification, or resuscitation (vivificatio, resuscitatio ) . Both 
terms designate the transplanting of the sinner from the state of 
spiritual death into the state of spiritual life, Eph. 2,1—9, through 
faith in Christ Jesus, Col. 2,11—13. Hence also these terms are 
synonyms of conversion. The Formula of Concord affirms (Thor. 
Decl., II, 87) : “The conversion of our corrupt will is nothing else 
than a resuscitation of it from spiritual death.” 

In an unscriptural sense the term has been employed by both 
synergists and Pietists to denote a state, or condition, in which 
the sinner is indeed awakened to a sense of his guilt and to a desire 
for salvation through Christ, but is not yet converted because he 
has not yet decided to accept divine grace (status medius). How¬ 
ever, according to Scripture all who are thus truly awakened 
(vivified, resuscitated) are already converted, Eph. 2, 5—8. 

It is true, the term awakened may be used correctly in the 
sense that a sinner has been alarmed by the Law, though not yet 
brought to faith in Christ through the Gospel. In that sense Felix, 
Acts 24, 25, and the jailer at Philippi, 16, 30, may be said to have 
been awakened. If used in this way, the “awakening” of the sinner 
belongs to the preparatory acts of conversion ( actus praeparatorii), 
or to the assisting grace of God (gratia assistens), which reacts 
upon the sinner merely from without (extrinsecus) , as our dogma- 
ticians have said. 



364 


CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


The great mistake which the Pietists and synergists made was 
that they applied the term awakened to those who were not only 
terrified by the divine Law, but possessed already “the first be¬ 
ginnings of faith” (prima initia fidei), in other words, who 
were already converted. The awakened, they maintained, were 
neither converted nor unconverted. Such a synergistic middle 
state (status medius), however, Scripture does not acknowledge, 
as we have shown above. On the contrary, according to Scripture 
every penitent sinner who has the prima initia fidei (scintillula 
fidei) is truly converted, as the Formula of Concord rightly teaches 
(Thor. Decl., II, 14). 

c. Illumination (Uluminatio). This term designates the 
transfer of man from his natural state of spiritual darkness into 
a new state of spiritual light, Eph. 5,8. Illumination, in its strict 
sense, therefore is synonymous with conversion; for it consists 
essentially in the gracious act of God by which He “opens the 
eyes of the spiritually blind, turns them from darkness to light 
and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive 
forgiveness of sins and inheritance ... by faith,” Acts 26,18. Both 
illumination and conversion occur through faith in the Gospel of 
Christ; both have the same terminus a quo, namely, darkness, and 
the same terminus ad quern, namely, faith. This is proved by the 
word of Christ: “I am come a Light into the world that whoso¬ 
ever believeth on Me should not abide in darkness,” John 12, 46. 
Hence, as long as a person is an unbeliever, he is not enlightened, 
or illuminated. With respect to this point the Pietists were right 
in opposing their orthodox opponents, who ascribed even to unbe¬ 
lieving ministers a certain illumination, or rather an allumination 
(alluminatio); for illumination can be predicated only of true 
believers in Christ. 

d. Vocation (vocatio). The term vocation in Scripture some¬ 
times denotes merely the proclamation of the Gospel, or the extend¬ 
ing of the divine invitation of salvation to sinners. In this sense 
all men are called who hear or read the gracious message of the 
Gospel, Matt. 20,16; 22,14. However, in most passages of Scrip¬ 
ture the word designates not merely the gracious offer of salvation 
through the Gospel, but the effectual calling of sinners to spiritual 
life, or their actual transfer from the kingdom of Satan to the 
kingdom of Christ. In this sense the term vocation is synonymous 
with conversion. The called (xtyxot) are the converted, that is to 
say, true believers, who by faith have appropriated unto themselves 



CONVERSION, OR THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


365 


the gracious promises of the Gospel, Rom. 1, 5. 6; 8, 30; 1 Cor. 1, 
2. 26; 2 Tim. 1, 9, etc. 

e. Repentance (poenitentia) . The term repentance (/ uerdvoia ) 
is used in both a narrower and a wider sense. The Formula of 
Concord thus writes (Thor. Decl., V, 7. 8): “The term repentance 
is not employed in the Holy Scriptures in one and the same sense. 
For in some passages of Holy Scripture it is employed and taken 
for the entire conversion of man, as Luke 13, 5; 15, 7. But in this 
passage, Mark 1,15, as also elsewhere, where repentance and faith 
in Christ, Acts 20, 21, or repentance and remission of sins, Luke 
24,46. 47, are mentioned as distinct, to repent means nothing else 
than truly to acknowledge sins, to be heartily sorry for them, and 
to desist from them” (i. e., from outward motives of fear and 
punishment; cp. Judas). 

Thus the term denotes: a) contrition, or the knowledge of 
sin wrought by the Law (terrores conscientiae); this is the mean¬ 
ing of the word in all those passages in which repentance is distin¬ 
guished from remission of sins, Luke 24, 47; b) contrition and 
faith, or the entire conversion of man, Luke 13, 5. In the latter 
sense the term repentance is a synonym of conversion. 

Baier writes of this distinction (III, 310) : “Although repen¬ 
tance is sometimes used in a stricter sense for that part of con¬ 
version which is called contrition, yet often it is employed for the 
entire conversion.” So also the Augsburg Confession describes re¬ 
pentance when it says (Art. XII): £f Repentance properly consists 
of these two parts: One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the 
conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which 
is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that for Christ’s 
sake sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from 
terrors.” 

The Augsburg Confession rightly adds that the good works 
which are bound to follow repentance are the fruits of repentance. 
Deinde sequi debent bona opera, quae sunt fructus poenitentiae. 

This important truth must be held against the error of the 
Romanists, who maintain that repentance consists of contrition, 
confession, and satisfaction (contritio cordis, confessio oris, satis- 
factio operis). The papistic error, according to which human satis¬ 
faction for all transgressions constitutes the essential part of repen¬ 
tance, is a total denial of the Scriptural doctrine of repentance, 
Mark 1,15, since it bases forgiveness of sins upon the good works 
of the penitent sinner. According to papistic teaching not only the

CONVERSION, OB THE BESTOWAL OF FAITH. 


confessio oris and the satisfactio operis, but also the contritio cordis 
must be regarded as a meritorious act of the sinner. Hence repen¬ 
tance, in the Eoman Catholic sense of the term, is altogether a work 
of man. 

This fact explains why Luther so vehemently inveighed against 
the papistic conception of repentance, insisting, on the basis of 
Scripture, that repentance indeed always produces good works, but 
is never the foundation upon which the forgiveness of sins rests. 
Cp. the Apology, Art. XII (V), 162.: “For the following dogmas 
are clearly false and foreign not only to Holy Scripture, but also 
to the Church Fathers: 1. that from the divine covenant we merit 
grace by good works wrought without grace; 2. that by attrition 
we merit grace; 3. that for the blotting out of sin the mere detes¬ 
tation of the crime is sufficient; 4. that on account of contrition, 
and not by faith in Christ, we obtain remission of sins,” etc. 

The Bomanistic conception of contrition, with its emphasis on 
the good works of the penitent, renders impossible not only true 
faith in Christ, or trust in His merits, but also true contrition 
(contritio passiva), or the terrores conscientiae, which God works 
in man through the Law. As long as a sinner “repents” in the 
sense of Eoman Catholic work-righteousness, it is impossible for 
him to believe in Christ and to be saved, Gal. 5, 4. 



JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH.

JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 

(De Justification©.) 


1. DEFINITION OF JUSTIFICATION. 

As soon as a contrite sinner believes the divine promises of 
grace which for Christ's sake is offered to him in the Gospel, or 
as soon as he puts his trust in the vicarious satisfaction which 
Christ has made for the sins of the world by His perfect obedience, 
he is justified, or declared righteous before God, Rom. 3, 23. 24. 
This is the so-called subjective justification, Rom. 4, 6, or the per¬ 
sonal application, through faith, of the merits which Christ has 
secured for the whole world by His substitutionary atonement 
(objective justification), 2 Cor. 5,19 ff. 

Holy Scripture quite simply describes the act of justifica¬ 
tion negatively as a “forgiving of sins,” or a “covering of sins," 
or a “non-imputation of sins," Rom. 4, 6—8, and positively as 
the “counting of faith for righteousness,” Rom. 4, 5; Gal. 3, 6; 
Rom. 4, 3. Subjective justification may therefore be defined as the 
act of God by which He removes from the believer the sentence 
of condemnation to which he is subject because of his sin, releases 
him from his guilt, and ascribes to him the merit of Christ. Baier 
defines justification as “the act by which the sinner, who is respon¬ 
sible for guilt and liable to punishment (reus culpae et poenae), 
but who believes in Christ, is pronounced just by God, the Judge.” 
(Doctr. Theol., p. 424.) 

By subjective justification we therefore do not understand 
“a moral condition existing in man or a moral change which he 
experiences, but only a divine judgment upon man, by which his 
relation to God is reversed.” (Ibid.) Hollaz rightly says: “Justifi¬ 
cation is a judicial and at the same time a gracious act by which 
God, reconciled by the satisfaction of Christ, acquits the sinner 
who believes in Christ of the offenses with which he is charged 
and accounts and pronounces him righteous.” (Doctr, Theol., 
p. 428). 

When defining justification by faith, we must bear in mind 
that justification by faith without works is based upon the justi¬ 
fication of the whole world, secured by Christ’s vicarious satis¬ 
faction and offered to all men in the Gospel, Acts 10,43. Because 
of the objective justification (reconciliation) subjective justifies- 



868 


JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


tion takes place “freely,” Rom. 3, 24, no work on the sinner's part 
being necessary to complete the justification of Christ. If the 
vicarious satisfaction of Christ is denied, no room is left for justi¬ 
fication by faith. On the other hand, the perfect redemption 
effected by Christ leaves no room for the papistic justification by 
works. The Gospel contains full pardon for every sinner, and as 
soon as he accepts the pardon by faith, he is justified subjectively. 

All who deny that the means of grace impart the forgiveness 
of sins (enthusiasts, Reformed, modern Lutheran theologians) and 
who make, not the redemptive work, but the “person of Christ” or 
His historical reality,” the object of faith, teach justification with¬ 
out faith by works, that is to say, by something in man, or by 
gratia infusa. However, that “faith is counted for righteousness,” 
Eom. 4, o, means that faith justifies, not considered in itself, but 
because of the object which it apprehends, namely, the promise of 
the Gospel. 

It is not Scriptural to say one must make only Christ or 
only His merit and not also the objective justification the object 
of justifying faith. — Only the direct promise of the Gospel can 
give us perfect assurance of the forgiveness of our sins. A justifi¬ 
cation by works from its very nature cannot but be productive of 
doubt. (Cf. Eom. 4,16.) The “theology of doubt” (monstrum 
incertitudinis) of papist theology is a necessary concomitant of 
the theology of work-righteousness. (Cf. Council of Trent, Sees. 6, 
Can. 13.) 

The Roman Catholic sect is the greatest enemy of the Chris¬ 
tian Church; for all Christians live, move, and have their being 
in the doctrine of justification by faith. But this doctrine the 
papacy does not permit its adherents to accept and believe. It 
rather reviles and curses the Scriptural doctrine of justification by 
faith (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. 6, Cans. 9,11.12. 20) and trains 
its followers to seek salvation by works. The Church of Rome has 
murdered thousands bodily for their adherence to the doctrine of 
justification by faith and millions spiritually by teaching them to 
trust in justification by works. 

The Roman Catholic claim that the majority of modern Prot¬ 
estant teachers are advocates of the Catholic doctrine of justifica¬ 
tion by works is well founded. Those who deny the vicarious 
satisfaction and teach salvation through “morality” or through an 
“ethical act” or through faith as a “moral act” or “force” consti- 



JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


309 


tute a large majority among Protestants. Yet the doctrine of justi¬ 
fication by faith, without works, has been believed and will be 
believed by all true members of the Christian Church to the end 
of time, Eom. 1,16.17; 3,21. 22 ; 4, 3; Rev. 7,14. (Cf. Dr. En- 
gelder, Dogmatical Notes.) 

2. JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH ALONE. 

(Sola Fide.) 

According to the express teachings of Holy Scripture the be¬ 
liever is justified by faith alone (sola fide), without the deeds of 
the Law, Rom. 3,28; 4, 5; Phil. 3, 9. Positively, Scripture affirms 
this truth by ascribing justification directly to faith, Rom. 3, 
21—24, and negatively, by excluding from justification every work 
of man as a meritorious cause, Rom. 3, 27. Indeed, Scripture 
emphatically declares that all who would be justified by works are 
under the curse. Gal. 3,10, and it illustrates this fact by examples 
which leave no doubt as to the necessity of excluding human works 
from justification, Rom. 4,1—3; Luke 18, 9—14. 

According to Scripture the attempt on the part of man to 
secure justification by his own efforts is “zeal not according to 
knowledge,” Rom. 10, 2, and the insistence upon good works as 
necessary for salvation “a doctrine of the flesh,” Gal. 3, 2. 3. On 
the other hand, it is the characteristic teaching of the Christian 
religion, which is of God, that sinners are justified before God 
solely by faith, without works. Gal. 1, 8; 5, 4. 5. Hence we must 
exclude from the act of justification not only a) all good works 
which God works in men in His Kingdom of Power (iustitia 
civilis), Rom. 2, 14. 15, but also b) all spiritually good works, 
which flow from faith, Rom. 4, 2. 3; for the exclusive particles 
(particular exclusivae), such as “without the Law,” “without 
works,” “not of works,” etc., Rom. 3, 28; 4, 5; Eph. 2,8. 9, debar 
from the act of justification all human works whatsoever. 

The Formula of Concord says (Thor. Decl., III, 9): “Concern¬ 
ing the righteousness of faith before God we believe . . . that poor 
sinful man is justified before God, that is, absolved and declared 
free and exempt from ail his sins and from the sentence of well- 
deserved condemnation,.. . without any merit or worth of our own, 
also without any preceding, present, or any subsequent works, out 
of pure grace, because of the sole merit, complete obedience, bitter 
suffering, death, and resurrection of our Lord Christ alone, whose 
obedience is reckoned to us for righteousness.” 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS.

870 


JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


Moreover, as the Formula of Concord shows, Holy Scripture 
also points out the reasons why human works must be excluded 
from justification, namely, a) because God wishes to demonstrate 
the glory of His grace in the unmerited salvation of sinful man¬ 
kind, Eph. 2, 9; 1, 6. 7, and b) because He, in His infinite grace, 
has purposed to provide for lost mankind a salvation of which the 
sinner, on the basis of His gracious promise, may be absolutely 
sure and certain, Rom. 4,16. 

By teaching that justification is by faith, without the deeds 
of the Law, Holy Scripture rejects the papistic errors a) that justi¬ 
fication is based upon infused grace (gratia infusa), or upon some 
good quality in man; b) that justification is a medical act (actus 
medicinalis), by which the sinner is made righteous through sanc¬ 
tification; c) that there are degrees (gradus) in justification, so 
that one believer is more justified than another; and d) that the 
believer cannot be sure of his salvation (monstrum incertitudinis). 

Positively, by its doctrine of sola fide, Scripture affirms a) that 
justification is based upon God’s gracious disposition in Christ 
Jesus (gratuitus Dei favor propter Christum), or upon divine 
grace, which is outside of man, “in God’s own heart,” though re¬ 
vealed and offered to him in the Gospel (Media gratiae instru- 
menta iustificationis sunt); b) that justification is a forensic act 
(actus forensis), by which God declares the sinner who believes in 
Christ to be righteous; c) that justification has no degrees, but is 
instantaneous and complete, the believer being justified as soon as 
he trusts in Christ for righteousness; d) that faith justifies not 
as a virtue or good quality in man, but solely as the instrument, 
or means, by which the believer lays hold of the perfect righteous¬ 
ness of the divine-human Savior; and e) that the believer may be 
sure of salvation, because salvation rests not upon his own worthi¬ 
ness, but upon the imputed merits of Christ. 

The doctrine of justification which the Reformers set forth 
in Art. IV of the Augsburg Confession is therefore truly Scrip¬ 
tural. It reads: “Men cannot be justified before God by their 
own strength, merits, or works, but are freely justified for Christ’s 
sake, through faith, when they believe that they are received into 
favor and that their sins are forgiven for Christ’s sake, who by His 
death has made satisfaction for our sins. This faith God imputes 
for righteousness in His sight, Rom. 3 and 4.” By pronouncing 
upon this comforting doctrine of Scripture its anathema, the 
Church of Rome has proved itself to be the Church of Antichrist. 



JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


371 


The doctrine of justification by faith, without the deeds of 
the Law, presupposes as necessary postulates a) objective justifi¬ 
cation, or the doctrine that Christ through His vicarious atone¬ 
ment has secured reconciliation for the whole world; b) universal 
grace (gratia universalis), or the doctrine that God earnestly desires 
the salvation of all men; c) salvation by grace alone (sola gratia), 
or the doctrine that the sinner is saved without any preceding, 
present, or subsequent human works; d) the means of gTace (media 
gratiae), or the doctrine that the Word of God and the Sacraments 
are the gracious means by which God offers and conveys to men 
the forgiveness of sins and righteousness which Christ has secured 
by His death ( media iouxa). 

All who deny these doctrines (Romanists, Calvinists, syner¬ 
gists) cannot consistently teach the Scriptural doctrine of justi¬ 
fication by faith, since the rejection of these teachings invariably 
leads to the teaching of work-righteousness. 

3. THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION THE CENTRAL 
DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION. 

It requires little proof to show that the article of justification 
by faith is the central doctrine (artie ulu s fundamentalissimus, 
articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae) of the entire Christian re¬ 
ligion; for it is the preeminent teaching of Holy Scripture, to 
which all the sacred truths of the Gospel converge. What the Word 
of God tells us of Christ’s incarnation, suffering, death, resurrec¬ 
tion, etc., is only the foundation of this paramount doctrine; for 
Christ became incarnate, suffered, died, rose again, etc., i n orde r 
that sinners, who could not be saved by their own efforts, might 
be justified by grace, through faith in His vicarious atonement. 
Hence those who deny the Scriptural doctrine of justification by 
faith deny the entire Christian religion; for they are compelled to 
teach the paganistic way of salvation by works, by which the Gospel 
of Christ is annulled. 

It is for this reason that Scripture so emphatically insists upon 
the clear and unadulterated proclamation of salvation by faith in 
Christ, John 3, 16; Rom. 3, 23—28; 1 Cor. 2, 2ff.; Gal. 2, 21; 
5, 4; Eph. 2, 8. 9; Phil. 3,8. 9; Gal. 1,8. 9; 3,1—3; 5,4; etc. 
The entire polemics of Scripture culminates in the refutation of 
all heresies that pervert the article of justification through faith 
in Christ, John 8, 24; Acts 10, 42. 43; Gal. 1, 6—10; Phil. 3, 
2—9, etc. Its supreme warnings and exhortations to the believer 



372 


JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


center in the appeal to continue in the faith of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, 2 Tim. 3, 8; Titus 2, 1—15; Heb. 4, 14—16; 1 Pet. 4, 
1—5; 1 John 5,10ff., etc. All its teachings either point forward 
to it (articuli antecedentes), Luke 24, 25—27, or back to it (articuli 
consequents#). Rev. 5, 9—14. It is the paramount theme of the 
Old Testament, Is. 53,4—6, and of the New Testament, 2 Cor. 5, 
19—21. 

In short, the d octrine of justifica tion by faith in the crucified 
and risen Christ is the en tire Gospel. Wherever it is believed, there 
the Church of Chrj§t*_the„communion of saints, exists; wherever 
it is not believed, there can be no Christian Church, since this has 
for its members only those who believe that Christ died for them 
and rose again, Mark 16,15.16; 1 Cor. 15,3. 4. Hence the Chris¬ 
tian pastor must so administer his office that unfailingly he 
teaches this doctrine in its truth and purity and exposes and rejects 
all errors that are contrary to it. Acts 26, 22. 23; Titus 1, 9. 

This is the clear demand which our Lutheran Confessions 
make of all who would serve as ministers of Christ’s holy Gospel. 
Thus the Srnalcald Articles (II, 4. 5) declare: “Since it is neces¬ 
sary to beli eve this and it cannot be otherwise acquire d^ or a ppre^ 
hended by any work, law, or merit, it is clear and certain that this 
faith alone justifies us, a& St^Paul says, Rom. 3, 26. 28. Of this 
article nothing can be yielded or surrendered (nor can anything be 
granted or permitted contrary to the same), even though heaven 
and earth, and whatever will not abide, should sink to ruin. For 
there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby 
we must be saved, says Peter, Acts 4,12. And with His stripes we 
are healed. Is. 53, 5. And upon this article all things depend which 
we teach and practise in opposition to the Pope, the devil, and the 
[whole] world. Therefore we must be sure concerning this doc¬ 
trine and not doubt; for otherwise all is lost, and the Pope and 
devil and all things gain the victory and suit over us.” Cp. also 
Art. II, 1: “Of this article nothing is to be surrendered or con¬ 
ceded because the first article does not allow it.” 

The Formula of Concord writes in the same vein (Art. Ill, 6): 
“This article concerning justification by faith, as the Apology says, 
is the chief article in the entire Christian doctrine, without which 
no poor conscience can have any firm consolation or can truly 
know the riches of the grace of Christ, as Dr. Luther also has 
written: ‘If this only article remains pure on the battle-field, the 
Christian Church also remains pure and in goodly harmony and 




JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


373 


without any sects; but if it does not remain pure, it is not possible 
that any error or fanatical spirit can be resisted.’ ” 

This firm stand of our Lutheran Confessions on the doctrine 
of justification by faith is taken also by our Lutheran dogmaticians, 
of whom Chemnitz, for example, writes ( hoc. Th., II, 216): “This 
one point mainly distinguishes the Church from all heathen and 
superstitions, as Augustine says: ‘The Church distinguishes the 
just from the unjust, not by the law of works, but by the law of 
faith.’ Yes, this article is, as it were, the citadel and chief bulwark 
of the entire Christian doctrine and religion, which being either 
obscured or adulterated or subverted, it is impossible to retain the 
purity of the doctrine in other points. But if this doctrine remains 
untouched, all idolatries, superstitions, and perversions in all the 
other doctrines destroy themselves.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 440.) 

Actually all true Christians, no matter how mufii they may 
be lacking in Christian knowledge and discernment on other points, 
hold to the doctrine of justification by faith, since all “are children 
of God by faith in Christ Jesus ” Gal. 3, 26—28; cp. also 3,7. 
Those who repudiate this article are extra ecclesiam (Gal. 3,10), 
or, as Luther says, “either Jews or Turks, papists or heretics.” 
Every true Christian confesses with Luther: “I believe that Jesus 
Christ, true God . . . and also true man, ... is my Lord, who has 
redeemed me, a lost and condemned creature,” etc. This truth we 
find attested especially in the many Christian hymns, which are 
the expressions of the personal faith of hundreds of Christians, 
who, though living at different places and times and belonging 
outwardly to different denominations, repeat the same joyous 
refrain: “By grace are ye saved, through faith,” Eph. 2, 8. 

4. THE CHRISTIAN TERMINOLOGY BY WHICH 
THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH 
IS GUARDED AGAINST ERROR. 

a. "By grace, for Christ’s sake, through faith.” These terms 
are used to exclude from the article of justification all works of 
men, either preceding, present, or following. The Formula of 
Concord writes (Thor. Decl., III, 25) : Ad iustificationem euim 
tantum haec requiruntur atque necessaria sunt: gratia Dei, meri- 
tum Christi et fides.” 

The expression by grace ascribes salvation alone to God’s 
gracious disposition in Christ (gratuitus Dei favor) and excludes 
from justification as a meritorious cause the so-called “infused 



374 


JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


grace” (gratia infusa) of papistic theology. The expression for 
Christ’s sake means as much as “for the sake of Christ’s vicarious 
satisfaction,” “since He has made satisfaction for us to the Law 
and paid for our sins” ( Formula of Concord, Thor. Decl., III, 14). 

Justification for Christ’s sake must be maintained a) against 
the papists, who regard infused grace (gratia infusa), love, etc., as 
a cause of justification; b) against all enthusiasts, who base justifi¬ 
cation not upon the merits of Christ, but upon the “Christ in us,” 
or upon His indwelling and sanctifying influence in the heart 
(Osiander); and c) against all modern rationalistic theologians, 
who reject the forensic character of justification as too “juridical” 
and define it as an ethical process, or a transformation of man 
(Umgestaltung der Menschheit) through the sanctifying influence 
of the Holy Spirit (actus medicinalis). 

The exp ression by faith designates faith as the receiving means 
(medium Xr)jiux6v), by which the believer appropriates to himself 
the merits of Christ offered to him in the means of grace ( media 
douxa). All three expressions together affirm the Scriptural truth 
“that all our righteousness is to be sought outside the merits, 
works, virtues, and worthiness of ourselves and of all men and 
rests alone upon Christ the Lord” ( Formula of Concord, Thor. 
Decl., III, 55). 

This truth must be defended against all errorists who substi¬ 
tute for the objective righteousness of Christ, which is outside the 
sinner, a righteousness which is within man as the ground for 
his justification (papists, enthusiasts, religious experimentalists 
[Erlebnistheologen ], etc.). 

b. “Justification not a physical or medical, but a forensic, 
or judicial, act." The meaning of these expressions is that justi¬ 
fication does not consist essentially in the inward transformation 
of the sinner, or in his sanctification, but rather in the divine act 
by which God declares a sinner righteous for Christ’s sake. That 
is to say, justification is not essentially a change by which man is 
made just, but a change whereby he is declared just on account of 
the perfect righteousness of Christ which he appropriates by faith. 
The change which follows justification is the fruit of faith and 
properly belongs into the doctrine of sanctification, not into that 
of justification. 

When we speak of justification as a forensic, or judicial, act, 
we must note, however, that there is a distinctive difference between 
the judgment of the civil courts and that of God. The civil courts 



JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


375 


justify, or declare righteous, the just and condemn the wicked. 
Those who justify the wicked and condemn the just are an abomi¬ 
nation to the Lord, Prov. 17,15. But God, in the act of justifi¬ 
cation, justifies the ungodly, Rom. 4, 5, and this on the valid 
ground that Christ by His perfect obedience has paid the debt for 
the wicked, Is. 53, 5. 6; 2 Cor. 5, 21. 

The Apology declares (Art. Ill, 185): “Moreover, in this 
passage [Rom. 5,1] to justify signifies, according to forensic usage, 
to acquit a guilty one and to declare him righteous, but on account 
of the righteousness of another, namely, of Christ, which righteous¬ 
ness of another is communicated to us by faith. Therefore, since 
in this passage our righteousness is the imputation of the righteous¬ 
ness of another, we must here speak concerning righteousness other¬ 
wise than when in philosophy or in a civil court we seek after the 
righteousness of one’s own work.” 

This distinction is important; for if God would justify only 
the just and condemn all the unjust, as do the civil courts, not 
a single sinner would be saved, Luke 18,14; Gal. 3,10, since in 
spite of all their moral efforts all men remain unrighteous before 
God, Is. 64, 6. The papistic doctrine that God can justify only 
those who really are just, either in whole or in part, cancels the 
entire Gospel-message of justification by faith. Luther rightly 
called this doctrine “the venom of Satan” and the “most pesti¬ 
lential pest (pestilentissima pestis; St. L., V, 517), since it de¬ 
prives the sinner of all true consolation and robs God of the honor 
which is due Him as the gracious Lord, who freely forgives sin for 
Christ’s sake, Rom. 3, 28; Eph. 2, 7—9. 

It is necessary to emphasize this truth because not only all 
Romanizing Protestants (Andrew Osiander, Schwenkfeld, Weigel), 
but also Arminians and synergists deny the actus forensis in its 
Scriptural sense. 

That the verb dixaiovv means “to declare righteous” and not 
“to make righteous” is incontestably proved not only by its con¬ 
sistent usage in Scripture, but also by the exclusive particles (par- 
ticulae exclusivae) which in Scripture are commonly joined with 
this term, Rom. 3, 23—28; 4, 5—8. These show that justification 
is not a healing or sanctifying process (actus medicinalis), by virtue 
of which the sinner is enabled to merit salvation by good works, 
but rather a forensic act, by which God for Christ’s sake declares 
him to be righteous, though in himself he is unworthy and un¬ 
righteous, Rom. 4, 5. 



876 


JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


c. “By faith alone” (sola fide). Luther’s insistence upon the 
sola fide was well motivated. His papistic opponents were willing 
to concede that the sinner is saved by faith; but they refused to 
admit that he is justified solely by faith (sola fide). They well 
understood that by this expression the Reformer did not mean to 
exclude from justification God’s grace, Christ’s merit, and the 
means of grace as God’s means of conferring the righteousness 
which Christ by His vicarious satisfaction has secured for the 
world ( media douxd). But they knew that by this term the Lu¬ 
therans meant to define faith merely as a receiving means (medium 
Irjmixdv; medium aut instrumentum) of the righteousness of 
Christ offered to the sinner in the Gospel; and to this definition 
they persistenly objected. When they declared that the sinner is 
“saved by faith,” they defined faith as a virtue or good quality 
(bona qualitas), implanted into him by God (gratia infusa), so 
that, after all, “salvation by faith” means “salvation by works” 
(fides, quae per caritatem operatur). 

The sola fide of Luther therefore served the purpose of denying 
this Semi-Pelagianistic error. Positively, it affirmed that faith 
saves merely as an instrumentum, or medium; negatively, that in 
the article of justification faith must not be considered as a good 
work or quality. 

The Lutherans were fully justified in their contention that 
their opponents, since they denied the sola, denied also the fide; 
in other words, that their doctrine of justification was in direct 
opposition to that of Scripture, Rom. 3, 28; 4, 5, which excludes 
from justification all human works. 

Thus the sola fide has become the shibboleth of the Refor¬ 
mation; and to-day it still is the slogan of the confessional Lu¬ 
theran Church to proclaim to the world its chief article of faith, 
namely, that a sinner is justified before God gratuitously, by 
His grace (datgeav xfj avzov %dgni), apart from works of the Law 
(xcogk egycov vopov), Rom. 3, 21—28. The Catholic Encyclopedia, 
sub “faith,” says: “By leaving out the obnoxious sola [alone], the 
article [Art. IV of the Augsburg Confession ] might be glossed in 
Catholic sense.” (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, II, 643 ff.) 

d. “Justification does not require even the presence of good 
works.” (Neque praesentia operum ad iustificationem requiritur.) 
This statement must be understood in the light of the important 
truth “that faith is never alone, yet always justifies alone” (Fides 
nunquam est sola, sed iustificat sola). This truth is clearly taught 



JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


377 


in Scripture. On the one hand, saving faith is always followed 
by works, Eom. 5,1—5 ; Gal. 5,6 ; Jas. 2,20; on the other hand, 
faith never saves inasmuch as it is productive of good works, Rom. 
3,28; 4,5. 

Of this the Formula of Concord writes (Thor. Decl., III, 41): 
"Good works do not precede faith, neither does sanctification pre¬ 
cede justification. But first faith is kindled in us in conversion by 
the Holy Ghost from the hearing of the Gospel. This lays hold 
of God’s grace in Christ, by which the person is justified. Then, 
when the person is justified, he is also renewed and sanctified by 
the Holy Ghost, from which renewal and sanctification the fruits 
of good works then follow. . . . This should not be understood 
as though justification and renewal were sundered from one another 
in such a manner that a genuine faith could exist and continue 
for a time together with a wicked intention, but hereby only the 
order ... is indicated how one precedes or succeeds the other. 
For what Luther has correctly said remains true nevertheless: 
Faith and good works well agree and fit together (are inseparably 
connected); but it is faith alone, without works, which lays hold 
of the blessing; and yet it is never and at no time alone.” 

The statements “Good works are required in justification,” or 
“Good works are necessary for salvation,” must be condemned as 
both wrong in themselves and as favoring the Pelagianistic doc¬ 
trine of human cooperation in conversion. It is against such 
erroneous statements as these that the Lutheran Church confesses: 
“Justification does not require even the presence of good works.” 

e. " Justification has no degrees" (Iustificatio non admittit 
gradus, non fit successive , non recipit magis et minus.) This Lu¬ 
theran statement is directed against the doctrines of the papists 
and Romanizing Protestants, who, while mingling sanctification 
into justification, assume that justification is successive, or gradual, 
inasmuch as divine grace in man (gratia infusa sive inhaerens) 
operates toward perfection by degrees, so that a person’s justifica¬ 
tion actually depends on his progress in sanctification. 

Against this error the confessional Lutheran Church teaches 
on the basis of Scripture that justification is instantaneous and 
therefore complete as soon as the sinner believes in Christ, Rom. 
4,7; Luke 18,24; Rom. 5,1. Luther thus writes: “Justification 
does not come in pieces, but in a heap.” 

It is true, there are degrees with respect to faith, for the faith 
of one Christian is strong while that of another is weak; but also 



378 


JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


a weak faith justifies as much as does the strong, since even a weak 
faith is trust in Christ’s righteousness. Luther rightly says (St. L., 
XI, 1840) : “Therefore we are all alike in Christ through faith. 
St. Peter may have a stronger faith than I, yet it is nevertheless 
the same faith in Christ. . . . Who receives Him [Christ] receives 
Him entirely, no matter whether he receives Him weakly or 
strongly.” 

f. “Forgiveness of sin is the entire justification, not merely 
a part of it.” This truth our Confessions affirm time and again. 
The Apology writes (Art. IV [II], 76): “To attain the remission 
of sins is to be justified, according to Ps. 32, 1: TRessed is he 
whose transgression is forgiven.’ ” And the Formula of Concord 
states (Epit., Ill, 7): “According to the usage of Holy Scripture 
the word justify means in this article to absolve, that is, to declare 
free from sins”; and again (Thor. Decl., Ill, 30): “The right¬ 
eousness of faith before God consists alone in the gracious recon¬ 
ciliation, or the forgiveness of sins.” 

This truth is taught by St. Paul in Horn. 4, 5—8, where he 
describes the justified as such whose sins are covered, or forgiven. 
Those of our dogmaticians who divide justification into two parts, 
namely, imputation of Christ’s righteousness and forgiveness of 
sins, do this for the sake of clarity. In reality the imputation of 
Christ’s righteousness is the necessary prerequisite of forgiveness; 
in other words, God, by imputing to the sinner Christ’s perfect 
righteousness, forgives his sins. In the divine verdict of justifica¬ 
tion the two acts really coincide; or we may say, they constitute 
one act, namely, that of justification. 

Scripture, when referring to the cause of justification, some¬ 
times mentions Christ (Horn. 3, 22), then again Christ’s righteous¬ 
ness (Rom. 6,18), or Christ’s death and blood (1 Cor. 2, 2), or His 
resurrection from the dead (Rom. 10, 9), or His name (1 John 
6,13), etc. But all these phrases express the same truth, namely, 
that a sinner is justified on account of Christ’s vicarious suffering 
and death, which God freely offers to all men in the Gospel. For 
the sake of clearness our dogmaticians usually distinguish between 
the causes of justification as follows: Divine grace is causa impul- 
siva interna; Christ (His vicarious satisfaction), the causa im- 
pulsiva externa sive meritoria; the Gospel, causa instrumentaiis 
ex parte Dei. These distinctions help us to understand the great 
truth that God most graciously forgives the sins of all who by faith 
appropriate to themselves Christ’s righteousness offered in the 
means of grace. And such forgiveness is justification. 



JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


379 


5. JUSTIFICATION ON THE BASIS OF WORKS. 

In some places. Scripture teaches also a justification on the 
basis of works, namely, the justification before men. When we 
speak of justification in this signification, we use the term in 
a wider sense. The true justification, which is before God 
(Ivcomov deov) and by which a sinner becomes a child of God, is 
by faith, without the deeds of the Law, Rom. 3, 20—22. However, 
such faith is known only to God; before men it remains invisible. 
For this reason God justifies His believing saints before men by 
their works; that is to say, He proves their faith and justification 
by their fruits, Luke 7, 47; John 13, 35; Matt. 12,37; 25, 34—40. 
So also all Christians should recognize their state of grace by 
the fruits which the Holy Spirit has wrought in their hearts, 1 John 
3,14; 2,3.4; 2 Pet. 1,10; Matt. 6,14. 

The Apology remarks very correctly (Art. Ill, 154): “Christ 
often connects the promise of the remission of sins with good works, 
not because He means that good works are a propitiation, for they 
follow reconciliation; but for two reasons. One is, because good 
fruits must necessarily follow. Therefore He reminds us that, if 
good fruits do not follow, the repentance is hypocritical and feigned. 
The other reason is, because we have need of external signs of 
so great a promise, because a conscience full of fear has need of 
manifold consolation. As therefore Baptism and the Lord’s Supper 
are signs that continually admonish, cheer, and encourage despond¬ 
ing minds to believe the more firmly that their sins are forgiven, 
so the same promise is written and portrayed in good works in 
order that these works may admonish us to believe the more firmly.” 
The justification on the ground of works thus coincides with the 
external testimony of the Holy Ghost (testimonium externum sive 
indirectum), which we distinguish from His internal testimony 
(testimonium internum sive directum), or faith. 

However, justification by faith and justification by works must 
not be mingled together, Gal. 3, 10. By the former the sinner 
obtains salvation; by the latter he is proved an heir of salvation. 
In order to make this matter clear, Luther sometimes speaks of 
inward and outward forgiveness. By the former he means justifi¬ 
cation before God; by the latter, justification before men. By the 
former a sinner becomes a child of God; by the latter he is proved 
a child of God. It is the basic error of Romanism to regard justi¬ 
fication by works as the ground of a sinner’s justification and thus 
to make salvation depend on good works. 



380 


JUSTIFICATION BT FAITH. 


It is evident that the doctrine of justification by faith (sola 
fide) cannot be taught in its purity unless the Scriptural distinc¬ 
tion between the Law and the Gospel is observed. The Law must 
never be mingled with justification, since this gracious act of God 
belongs entirely in the Gospel. But the Law is mingled with justi¬ 
fication whenever the latter is based, either in whole or in part, 
upon some natural or spiritual virtue in man or when faith is 
said to justify as a “good quality” or as the source of sanctification 
or as compliance with the demands of the Law or as the beginning 
of the Christian’s new life, etc. In short, the Law is mingled with 
justification whenever justification is grounded, in whole or in 
part, on human works (Pelagians, synergists, Arminians). 

Such mingling of the Law with justification destroys, of 
course, the blessed consolation which God has intended to bestow 
upon men by the glorious doctrine of justification by faith. While 
the doctrine of justification by faith gives the believer full assur¬ 
ance of salvation, that of justification by works removes this 
assurance; for it takes salvation out of the gracious hand of God 
and places it in man’s own sinful and impotent hand. It is a sig¬ 
nificant fact that all errorists who deny the sola fide deny also the 
Scriptural truth that a believer may be sure of his salvation. 

Foremost among these errorists is the Pope, whom Luther ex¬ 
posed as the Antichrist, showing him to be such not because of his 
unholy works, but mainly because of his shameful perversion of 
the Scriptural doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in 
Christ. Luther’s assertion as to the Pope’s being the Antichrist 
spoken of in 2 Thess. 2 is correct; for to this day the anathema of 
the Council of Trent upon all true Christians who adhere to the 
Scriptural doctrine of justification by faith is upheld by the Church 
of Rome. 

6. THE EFFECTS OF JUSTIFICATION. 

(Effectus Iustiflcationls.) 

As soon as a person has been justified by faith, he is in 
possession of all the spiritual blessings which Christ has secured 
for the world by His vicarious atonement, 1 Cor. 3, 21; Rom. 
5,1—5. Having by faith received the adoption of sons, Gal. 4, 5 ; 
John 1,12, he is an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ, Rom. 
8,17, so that he lacks no spiritual gift whatsoever, 1 Cor. 1,4—7; 
Eph. 1, 3—8. Of the spiritual blessings which justification confers 
we may mention in particular: — 



JUSTIFICATION BT FAITH. 


881 


a. The state of grace (status gmtiae). The justified believer 
is no longer under wrath, Eph. 2,1—3, but in that blessed state 
where he has peace with God (pax conscientiae) , Rom. 5, 1. 
Through faith in Christ he is sure not only of divine grace in the 
present life, but also of eternal salvation in the life to come (spes 
vitae aetemae), Rom. 5, 2. The certainty of divine grace and 
eternal life through faith must be maintained against all Semi- 
Pelagians (papists) and synergists, who assert that a believer 
cannot be sure of salvation. As a matter of fact all those who 
uphold the “monster of uncertainty” (monstrum incertitudinis) 
thereby show that they are ignorant of what justification in its 
Scriptural sense really means. 

The “monster of uncertainty” is the unfortunate result of the 
mingling of justification and sanctification, or of the fatal error 
that salvation depends, at least in part, on human works. The 
objections against the certainty of salvation which have been raised 
also within the external Lutheran Church are utterly devoid of 
Scriptural ground; for such passages as 1 Cor. 10, 12; Rom. 
11, 20, etc., upon which these objections are founded, are designed 
not to intimidate the believer, but rather to warn those who are 
carnally secure and indifferent. Hence doubts with respect to the 
certainty of salvation must not be regarded or commended as 
a virtue, but must be condemned as unbelief, Rom. 4, 16; 8, 17. 
37—39. 

b. The indwelling of the Holy Ghost and of the Holy Trinity 
(inhdbitatio Spiritus Sancti sive Dei triuni essentialis). Through 
faith the justified believer receives the Holy Spirit, who dwells in 
his heart as in His holy temple, Gal. 3, 2; 1 Cor. 3,16, strengthen¬ 
ing his faith and moving him to continuous childlike prayer, Gal. 
4,6; Rom. 8,15.16. 

But according to Scripture not only the Holy Spirit, but also 
the entire Holy Trinity dwells essentially in the believer, John 
14, 23. This wonderful union of God with the believer is called 
unio spiritualis, or unio mystica, 1 Cor. 6, 17; Eph. 5, 30—32. 
While through the mystic union the substance of the Christian is 
not transformed into that of God, as mystics at all times have 
affirmed (Weigel, Schwenkfeld), we nevertheless maintain on the 
basis of Scripture that God Himself (unio essentialis) and not 
merely His gifts ( dona Dei; papists. Calvinists), dwells in the 
believer. 



882 


JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


With equal emphasis we at the same time reject the error of 
Andrew Osiander, who taught that the essential indwelling of 
Christ is the believer’s righteousness before God; for Christ is 
our Eighteousness inasmuch as He has redeemed us by His vica¬ 
rious atonement and not inasmuch as He, with His essential right¬ 
eousness, is found within us. In other words, our righteousness 
before God is Christ’s perfect obedience (obedientia activa et pas¬ 
sives; iustitia aliena), which we appropriate through faith, Eom. 
3,24; 5,18.19. 

c. Sanctification, or renewal (sanctificatio vel renovatio). By 
sanctification, or renewal, we understand the inward transforma¬ 
tion of the believer through the Holy Ghost (mutatio hominis in¬ 
terna per actum physicum vel medicinalem), by which he is re¬ 
moved from the service of sin and made fit for the service of God 
in a new spiritual life (iustitia inhaerens; iustitia vitae). 

These inward spiritual changes occur in the very moment in 
which a person is justified by faith; for they are the unfailing 
fruits of justification, Eom. 6,1—11. Before a person is justified, 
neither sanctification nor good works are to be found in him, Eph. 
2,1—3; but after justification he is continually being sanctified 
and actuated to good works through faith in Christ, Eph. 2,10; 
Gal. 5,6. For this reason sanctification and good works are indi¬ 
cations (indicia) of the accomplished justification, 1 These. 4, 9; 
John 14, 15, though they are never a cause of justification, 
Eph. 2, 8. 9. 

d. The Christian liberty (libertas Christiana). By Christian 
liberty we mean the believer’s absolute freedom from every form 
of human tyranny in spiritual matters. Gal. 5, 1—4. In other 
words, the justified believer is no longer a servant of men, 1 Cor. 
7, 23, to heed and obey human doctrine, but he is a servant of God, 
Eom. 6, 22, and of Christ, 1 Cor. 3, 23, whose Word is the only rule 
of his faith, John 8, 31. 32. In relation to God all Christians are 
subordinate, for they all are equally bound to His Word and sub¬ 
ject to His will, 1 John 5, 3; Matt. 22, 38—40; but in relation to 
one another they are brethren, Matt. 23, 8, who are alike obedient 
to their divine Master, Luke 17,10, and subservient to one another 
in love, Gal. 5,13.14. 

Hence in the Christian Church not the word of man must 
prevail, but only the Word of God. Christian liberty thus consists 
in the believer’s freedom from the doctrines of men. Matt. 16, 9, 
and his unswerving attachment to Christ and His Word. 



JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH. 


383 


e. Membership in the Christian Church and possession of all 
its gifts and blessings. The Christian Church is the communion 
of saints, that is, of all true believers in Christ, 1 Cor. 1,1. 2 ; Eph. 
1,1; 2, 20; Acts 5,14. Hypocrites, or nominal Christians, are not 
members of the Church, though in this life they are outwardly 
joined with the visible Church. The rights and privileges of the 
Church, commonly called the Office of the Keys (potestas clavium), 
that is, the peculiar church power to administer the means of grace, 
to forgive and retain sins, to preach the Word of God in its purity, 
to call and ordain ministers, etc., belong to all believers and not 
merely to the clergy, Matt. 16, 19; cp. with 18, 18; 28, 19. 20; 
1 Cor. 3,21, as will be shown later. 



884 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION 
AND GOOD WORKS. 

(De Sanctifications et Bonis Operibus.) 


1. DEFINITION OF SANCTIFICATION. 

The justification of a sinner is immediately followed by his 
sanctification, or renovation, Rom. 5, 1—5. That is to say, the 
justified sinner turns from sin and serves Ood in good works, Rom. 
12, 1. 2; 1 Thess. 4, 3—7; 5, 23; 1 Pet. 1, 15; Rom. 13, 13. 14. 
As many other theological terms, so also that of sanctification 
(jdyiaafiog, dyuoovvrf) is used in a wider and a narrower sense. 

In its wider sense, sanctification embraces all acts of divine 
grace by which the Holy Spirit turns a person from sin to holiness 
and from the service of Satan to the holy, happy service of God, 
Heb. 13, 12; Acts 26, 18. In other words, sanctification in its 
wider sense includes every work of God by which He separates 
a sinner from the lost and condemned world and makes him Hia 
own, such as the bestowal of faith, justification, sanctification in 
its narrower sense, or the inward change in man by which he 
becomes holy, his preservation in faith to the end, and his final 
glorification on the day of Judgment, 2 Thess. 2,13; 1 Pet. 1, 2. 

In the wider sense of the term Christians are designated in 
Scripture called saints (xtyzol ayioi), Rom. 1, 7; 1 Cor. 1, 2, or per¬ 
sons whom God has graciously endowed with faith, justified, and 
transplanted into His kingdom, in which He purposes to preserve 
them through faith unto the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ, Phil. 
1, 3—6. In its wider sense Luther uses the term sanctification in 
his Large Catechism (Art. Ill, 40. 41), where he says: “I believe 
that the Holy Ghost makes me holy, as His name implies. But 
whereby does He accomplish this, or what are His method and 
means to this end? Answer: By the Christian Church, the for¬ 
giveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life ever¬ 
lasting.” So also Quenstedt writes: “Sanctification is sometimes 
employed in a wider sense (late) and includes justification, as 
Eph. 5, 26; Heb. 10,10; otherwise, however, it is used in a strict 
sense (stride), and thus coincides with renovation in its strict 
sense, as in Rom. 6,19. 22; 1 Thess. 4, 3. 4. 7.” 

In its narrower, or strict, sense, sanctification denotes the 
inward spiritual transformation of the believer, which follows 
upon, and is inseparably joined with, justification, Rom. 6, 22; 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 385 

2 Cor. 7,1. Of the order between justification and sanctification 
the Formula of Concord writes (Thor. Decl., Ill, 40. 41): “In the 
same manner the order also between faith and good works must 
abide and be maintained and likewise between justification and 
renewal, or sanctification. For good works do not precede faith, 
neither does sanctification precede justification. But first faith is 
kindled in us in conversion by the Holy Ghost from the hearing 
of the Gospel. This lays hold of God’s grace in Christ, by which 
the person is justified. Then, when the person is justified, he is 
also renewed and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, from which renewal 
and sanctification the fruits of good works then follow.” 

To reverse this order and make sanctification in its narrower 
sense the cause of justification (Papism) means to give up the 
central article of the Christian faith and to base salvation on work- 
righteousness, Gal. 5, 4. Justification and sanctification are indeed 
indissolubly (nexu indivulso) joined together; yet the two must 
not be mingled with each other. Justification is the source of 
sanctification. To teach the reverse means to teach the antichristian 
doctrine of work-righteousness and thus to thwart both justifica¬ 
tion and sanctification. 

The righteousness of faith (iustitia imputata), by which a per¬ 
son becomes a Christian, is outside of man; for God declares the 
ungodly to be just for Jesus’ sake, Rom. 4, 5. Sanctification, how¬ 
ever, takes place within man, and by it he is transformed into a holy 
man (iustitia inhaerens), 2 Cor. 7,1. Inherent righteousness, or 
the righteousness of life, is not at all a part of imputed righteous¬ 
ness, Phil. 3, 9, but follows justification, Rom. 6,14; Titus 3, 7. 8. 

In ecclesiastical language sanctification and renovation (re¬ 
newal) are commonly used as synonyms. Sanctification is renewal 
inasmuch as the believer thereby enters upon a new life; renewal 
is sanctification inasmuch as the new life of the believer is a holy 
life. Our Confession at times also distinguishes between sanctifica¬ 
tion and good works as between cause and effect (antecedent et 
consequens). In that case sanctification is conceived as the prin¬ 
ciple of holiness from which all good works flow, Gal. 5, 25. 26. 22. 

Properly speaking, however, the good works of the believer 
coincide with his sanctification, since the latter, viewed concretely 
(in concreto), occurs by way of performing individual good works, 
the believer either suppressing that which is evil or accomplishing 
that which is praiseworthy. Sanctification, viewed concretely, is 
never an idle state or quality (status otiosus; habitus otiosus), 

25 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



386 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


but a continued act, or a ceaseless activity, since the Holy Spirit 
is always operative in the believer, Titus 2,11; Gal. 5,22—25. 

Of faith, which is the direct causative principle of sanctifica¬ 
tion, Luther rightly says: “Oh, it is a living, busy, active, powerful 
thing that we have in faith, so that it is impossible for it not to do 
good unceasingly! Nor does it ask whether good works are to be 
done; but before the question is asked, it has wrought them and 
is always engaged in doing them. . . . Faith is a living, bold trust 
in God’s grace, so certain that a man would die a thousand times 
for it. . . . And on account of this, man becomes ready and cheer¬ 
ful, without coercion, to do good to every one, to serve every one, 
and to suffer everything for love and praise to God, who has con¬ 
ferred this grace on him, so that it is impossible to separate works 
from faith, yea, just as impossible as it is for heat and light 
to be separated from fire.” ( Formula of Concord, Thor. Decl., 
Art. IY, lOff.) 

2. THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF SANCTIFICATION. 

(Causa Efflciens Sanctlflcatlonis.) 

As God by His almighty power engenders faith in man, Eph. 
1,19; John 6,29, so also He works in the believer sanctification 
as the fruit of faith, 1 These. 5, 23. 24; 1 Cor. 3, 16; 6, 19; 
Eph. 2,10. Nevertheless there is this distinction between conver¬ 
sion and sanctification, that in the former man is purely passive 
(pure passive se habet), while in the latter he cooperates with the 
Holy Ghost (active se habet sive cooperatur). 

However, this cooperation must be rightly understood. It is 
not coordinate with the operation of the Holy Ghost, but subordi¬ 
nate to it. In other words, man cooperates in sanctification depen- 
denter a Deo; that is to say, he works because and inasmuch as 
the Holy Ghost works in him, Rom. 8, 14: 5ooi nvevfj.au deov 
ayovxai; Gal. 5,16—18: el Se nvevfiau dyeo&e. Hence every new 
spiritual impulse which the believer has, and every new good work 
which he does, is prompted and executed in him through the 
gracious power of the Holy Spirit, Phil. 1,6; 2,13. 

The Formula of Concord writes of this very correctly (Thor. 
Decl., II, 65): “As soon as the Holy Ghost,. . . through the Word 
and the holy Sacraments, has begun in us this His work of regen¬ 
eration and renewal, it is certain that through the power of the 
Holy Ghost we can and should cooperate, although still in great 
weakness. But this . . . does not occur from our carnal, natural 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


387 


powers, but from the new powers and gifts which the Holy Ghost 
has begun in us in conversion, as St. Paul expressly exhorts that 
as workers together with Him we receive not the grace of God in 
vain, 2 Cor. 6,1. But this is to be understood in no other way than 
that the converted man does good to such an extent and as long as 
God by His Holy Spirit rules, guides, and leads him and that, as 
soon as God would withdraw His gracious hand from him, he could 
not for a moment persevere in obedience to God. But if this were 
understood thus, . . . that the converted man cooperates with the 
Holy Ghost in the manner as when two horses together draw 
a wagon, this could in no way be conceded without prejudice to 
the divine truth.” 

Hence not only conversion, but also sanctification depends en¬ 
tirely upon God's grace, 2 Cor. 5,17.18; 3, 5 : % Ixavorrjs lx tov 
deov. This great truth, so clearly revealed in Scripture, should 
prompt the believer continually to perfect sanctification, Rom. 
6,14; 2 Cor. 7,1; Heb. 12,1. 2. 

3. THE INNER MOTIONS OF SANCTIFICATION. 

(Motus Intemi Sanctlflcationis.) 

Through faith in Christ the believer becomes a new creature, 
Eph. 4, 24; Col. 3,10; 2 Cor. 4,16; 5,17, who consents to God’s 
will, Kom. 7, 22, and lives wholly unto God, in the newness of the 
spiritual life into which he has entered, Rom. 6,1—11. 

Nevertheless, while the believer thus serves God according to 
the inward, or new, man which has been implanted in him i i his 
conversion, Eph. 4, 24; Rom. 7, 22. 25, there remains in him also 
the old man, or the corruption of his nature, Eph. 4, 22; 2 Cor. 
4, 16; Rom. 6, 6; 7, 18, so that according to the old man he is 
subject to sin, Rom. 7, 18—24, and continually opposes, and 
struggles against, the Spirit, Gal. 5,17: t) oag£ Im&v/uei xaxa tov 
Jivev/imos. 

Sanctification therefore occurs in the believer : n this manner, 
that after his inward, or new, man he combats th.; fiesh with its 
affections and lusts. Gal. 5, 24, resists its evil desires, pre\ ants its 
wicked designs, and performs that which is pleasing to God, con¬ 
trary to the promptings of his perverse nature. Such is the combat 
of the spirit against the flesh which Scripture so earnestly demands 
of all believers. Negatively they by faith always put off the old man 
(TiaAatdf tiv&Qconos), and positively they continually put on the 
new man ( xaivog &v&Q(onoi), which after God is created in true 
righteousness and holiness, Eph. 4, 24; Col. 3,10. 



388 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


The “old man” is the corrupt nature, or mind; the “new 
man,” the mind conformed to God’s will. While the believer is 
perfectly holy in so far as he is a new man, Rom. 6,1—11; Eph. 
4, 24; 1 John 3, 9, the old man is and remains thoroughly corrupt, 
Rom. 7,18. Sanctification is effected not by reforming, Rom. 8,13; 
Gal. 5, 24, but by crucifying and mortifying him, Matt. 18,8. 9. 

With regard to the struggle of the spirit against the flesh the 
Christian must note the following: — 

a. The constant struggle between the two natures in the be¬ 
liever does not prove that he has fallen from grace, as many true 
Christians in hours of trial are inclined to think, but, on the con¬ 
trary, it is a proof that he is living in the state of grace, Rom. 7, 
22—25. There is spiritual death only when the struggle against 
the flesh has ceased, Rom. 8,13. 

b. Since the old man in the believer always remains corrupt, 
so that according to the flesh Christians are no better than unbe¬ 
lievers, who have never been born again, John 3, 5. 6, the believer 
must not bt surprised if he is tempted by his carnal nature to 
commit even gross sins, Rom. 7, 18; 1 Thess. 4, 3—7. On the 
other hand, this fact should induce him to continue without ceasing 
to mortify the deeds of his body and to crucify the flesh, Rom. 
8, 13; Gal. 5, 24; Col. 3, 5; 1 Cor. 9, 27; Matt. 18, 8. 9. 

c. The struggle against the carnal nature is both difficult and 
painful, since it is directed against the believer’s own evil flesh, 
Heb 12,1. Yet the good fight of faith against the flesh must go 
on t>. the end, 1 Tim. 6,12; 2 Tim. 4, 7. It is of great comfort to 
believers that even the greatest saints in the Bible were obliged 
continually to wage war against their evil flesh, Rom. 7,24. 

d. Scripture assures the believers that in their struggles against 
the flesh they will finally obtain the victory provided they adhere 
to God’s Word and thus permit the Holy Spirit to work effectually 
in their hearts John 15, 7. 8; Eph. 6,17; Rom. 8, 37; Luke 18, 
26. 27; 2 Cor. 12,10; 4, 8ff.; etc. It is understood that with such 
steadfast use of God’s Word there must be joined also ceaseless, 
ferveni prayer, Matt. 26, 41; Eph. 6,18. 

e. It is an important rule of Christian combat always to sub¬ 
stitute for the evil impulse and desire of the flesh the corresponding 
holy impulse and desire of the inward man. In other words, when 
the Christian is tempted to murmur against God, let him praise 
and give thanks; when he is troubled with impure thoughts, let 
him strive the more after that chastity which the holy Savior de-

mands of His disciples; if he is weary in well-doing, let him follow 
the more zealously the goal of goodness which is set before him, etc. 
However, to accomplish this, he must know the Word of God and 
like Christ meet every temptation to evil with proper passages from 
Scripture, Matt. 4,1—11. 

In conclusion, we may add what Luther says on this important 
matter (Holman transl., Yol. Ill, p. 31): “This life is not right¬ 
eousness, but growth in righteousness; not health, but healing; 
not being, but becoming; not rest, but exercise. We are not yet 
what we shall be, but we are growing toward it; the process is not 
yet finished, but it is going on; this is not the end, but it is the 
road; all does not yet gleam with glory, but all is being purified.” 
“Dass also dies Leben nicht ist eine Froemmiglceit, sondem ein 
Frommwerden, nicht eine Oesundheit, sondem ein Gesundwerden, 
nicht ein Wesen, sondem ein Werden, nicht eine Ruhe, sondem 
eine Uebung: wir sintfs noch nicht, wir werden’s aber. Es ist 
noch nicht getan und geschehen, es ist dber in Gang und Schwang. 
Es ist nicht das Ende, es ist aber der Weg; es gluehet und glaenzt 
noch nicht alles, es fuegt sich aber alles ." 

4. THE MEANS BY WHICH SANCTIFICATION 
IS ACCOMPLISHED. 

The means by which the old man is mortified and the new 
man is strengthened is the Word of God; properly speaking, how¬ 
ever, not the Law, but the Gospel. The Law indeed reveals sin. 
Bom. 3, 20, but it cannot free the sinner from the curse and do¬ 
minion of sin. Bom. 7, 5—13. However, also in the process of sanc¬ 
tification the Law must be diligently used by the believer as a means 
to prepare the way for the Gospel in showing the exceeding sinful¬ 
ness of sin, as also to point out what works are truly pleasing to 
God, 1 Cor. 6,1—10. Thus the believer uses the Law as a mirror 
(Bom. 3,20) that “he may be led to the knowledge of his sins”; 
as a curb (1 Cor. 9, 27) “to restrain his intractable carnal heart as 
though by certain bars”; and as a “fixed rule (Ps. 119, 9) accord¬ 
ing to which he regulates and directs his whole life.” 

The Formula of Concord aptly declares (Epit., VI, 4): “For 
although they [the believers] are regenerate and renewed in the 
spirit of their mind, yet in the present life this regeneration and 
renewal is not complete, but only begun, and believers are, by the 
spirit of their mind, in a constant struggle against the flesh, that 
is, against the corrupt nature and disposition which cleaves to us

THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


unto death. On account of this Old Adam, which still inheres in 
the understanding, the will, and all the powers of man, it is needful 
that the Law of the Lord always shine before them [mirror] in 
order that they may not from human devotion institute wanton 
and self-elected cults [rule] ; likewise, that the Old Adam also 
may not employ his own will, but may be subdued against his will, 
not only by the admonition and threatening of the Law, but also 
by punishments and blows [curb], so that he may follow and sur¬ 
render himself captive to the Spirit, 1 Cor. 9, 27 ; Rom. 6,12; Gal. 
6,14; Ps. 119, Iff.; Heb. 13, 21 (Heb. 12,1).” 

While the Law thus reveals sin (mirror), restrains the flesh 
outwardly (curb), and guides the Christian to good works (rule), 
the power to accomplish sanctification and to do good works comes 
alone from the Gospel, Rom. 12,1; 1 John 4,10.11. According to 
Scripture it is the Gospel which inscribes the Law in the heart and 
enables the believer to keep it, Jer. 31, 31 f. While it is true that 
through the Law externally good works (iustitia civilis) may be 
produced in men since they are made to fear God’s wrath and 
punishments, it is alone the Gospel that produces spiritually good 
works (iustitia spiritmlis), or works which flow from true faith 
in Christ and true love to God. (Cp. Luther, St. L., XII, 318 ff.) 

With respect to the chastisements with which God visits His 
saints on earth, such as poverty, sickness, sorrow, etc., we may say 
that, while these do not in themselves sanctify the believers, yet 
they are the means by which God induces them to meditate on 
His Word, so that through the study of the Law they learn that 
they indeed deserve the chastening trials of God, and through the 
study of the Gospel they again comfort themselves with the abiding 
love of their heavenly Father, Rom. 8, 35—39. Also the blessings 
with which God endows His saints on earth should lead them to 
repentance, Rom. 2, 4, namely, by moving them to search the Holy 
Scriptures, in which the glory of divine grace shines forth in the 
face of Christ Jesus and from which they constantly draw strength 
for greater faith and holier service, Ps. 119, 9—16.105—112. 

5. THE NECESSITY OF SANCTIFICATION AND 
GOOD WORKS. 

In the Lutheran Church the question has been debated with 
great ardor whether it is correct or not to say: “Good works are 
necessary.” (Cp. Forviula of Concord, Art. IY.) Those who de¬ 
nied the query did so because they understood the word necessitas 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


391 


in the sense of coercion, so that the statement “Good works are 
necessary” was interpreted by them to mean: “Believers are co¬ 
erced to do good works.” This declaration they rightly regarded 
as unscriptural, and so they objected to the emphatic demand of 
Luther and the Gnesio-Lutherans that “good works are necessary.” 

While the Formula of Concord admits the truth that “good 
works are done by believers, not through coercion, but from a will¬ 
ing mind, sanctified by faith,” it nevertheless insists that the state¬ 
ment “Good works are necessary” is Scriptural. It therefore says 
(Thor. Decl., Art. IV, 3) : “It has been urged by some that good 
works are not necessary, but are voluntary [free and spontaneous] 
because they are not extorted by fear and the penalty of the Law, 
but are to be done from a voluntary spirit and a joyful heart.” 

And again (IV, 14. 15) : “As regards the necessity or volun¬ 
tariness of good works, it is manifest that in the Augsburg Con¬ 
fession and its Apology the expressions are often used and repeated 
that good works are necessary; likewise, that it is necessary to do 
good works, which also are necessarily to follow faith and recon¬ 
ciliation; likewise, that we necessarily are to do and must do such 
good works as God has commanded. Thus also in the Holy Scrip¬ 
tures themselves the words necessity, needful, and necessary, like¬ 
wise ought and must, are used concerning what we are bound to 
do because of God’s ordinance, command, and will, as Rom. 13, 5; 
1 Cor. 9, 9 ; Acts 5, 29; John 15,12; 1 John 4, 21. Therefore the 
expressions or propositions mentioned . . . are unjustly censured 
and rejected in this Christian and proper sense, as has been done 
by some; for they are employed and used with propriety to rebuke 
and reject the secure, epicurean delusion by which many fabricate 
for themselves a dead faith or delusion, which is without repen¬ 
tance and without good works, as though there could be in a heart 
true faith and at the same time the wicked intention to persevere 
and continue in sins, which is impossible; or as though one could 
indeed have and retain true faith, righteousness, and salvation even 
though he be and remain a corrupt and unfruitful tree, whence no 
good fruits whatever come, yea, even though he persist in sins 
against conscience or purposely engage again in these sins, — all of 
which is incorrect and false.” 

In this way the Formula of Concord, on the one hand, ex¬ 
cludes all possible misunderstanding of the terms necessity, must, 
ought, etc., and, on the other, establishes on Scriptural grounds 
the true necessity of sanctification and good works. What Holy 



392 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


Scripture teaches concerning the necessity of sanctification and 
good works may be stated as follows: — 

a. Sanctification and good works are not necessary for sal¬ 
vation. This truth is expressly taught in Scripture, which ascribes 
salvation entirely to divine grace in Christ, Eph. 2, 8. 9; Rom. 4, 6, 
excluding at the same time most vigorously, through the use of 
exclusive particles (particular exclusivae): “without Law ” “with¬ 
out works ” “by grace ” all works of men, either preceding or fol¬ 
lowing justification, Titus 3, 3—7. 

Roman Catholic theologians teach the necessity of good works 
for justification and salvation (Council of Trent, Sees. VIII, 
Can. 24). While the Jesuits claim that salvation is gained by good 
works alone, others maintain that salvation is obtained through 
Christ and good works (the Council of Trent). However, both 
parties nullify grace and lead the sinner to hell. Modern ration¬ 
alistic theologians likewise teach the necessity and meritoriousness 
of good works for salvation; this error is a corollary of the 
erroneous doctrine of justification by works. 

The Formula of Concord rightly says (Thor. Decl., IV, 
22—24): “Here we must be well on our guard lest works are 
drawn and mingled into the article of justification and salvation. 
Therefore the propositions are justly rejected that to believers good 
works are necessary for salvation, so that it is impossible to be saved 
without good works. For they are directly contrary to the doctrine 
de particulis exclusivis in articvlo iustificationis et salvationis (con¬ 
cerning the exclusive particles in the article of justification and 
salvation), that is, they conflict with the words by which St. Paul 
has entirely excluded our works and merits from the article of 
justification and salvation and ascribed everything to the grace of 
God and the merit of Christ alone, as explained in the preceding 
article. Again they . . . take from the afflicted, troubled consciences 
the comfort of the Gospel, give occasion for doubt, are in many 
ways dangerous, strengthen presumption in one’s own righteousness 
and confidence in one’s own works; besides, they are accepted by 
the papists and in their interest adduced against the pure doctrine 
of the alone-saving faith. Moreover, they are contrary to the form 
of sound words, as it is written that blessedness is only of the man 
unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, Rom. 4, 6.” 

While our Confession emphatically condemns the gross error 
of Majorism, namely, that good works are necessary for salvation, 
or to acquire salvation, it rejects with equal vigor as unscriptural 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


393 


also the later modified form of Majorism (Major, Menius) that 
good works are necessary to preserve faith or salvation. As salva¬ 
tion is not bestowed upon man on account of his works, so it is 
neither preserved by him through his works, but alone by the 
Holy Ghost, through the Gospel and faith, Phil. 1, 6; 1 Pet. 1, 5; 
2 Tim. 1,12—14; 2 Thess. 3, 3. 

The Formula of Concord rightly rejected the error of Ma- 
jorism because its evil source was the synergism of Melanchthon 
( Loci of 1535: “Good works are the causa sine qua non, and hence 
they are necessary for salvation), which Luther so vehemently con¬ 
demned, compelling his colleague at the same time to retract his 
false doctrine. Cp. Dr. Bente, “Historical Introductions to the 
Symbolical Books,” Trigl., pp. 112 ff.: “This is the very theology 
of Erasmus, nor can anything be more opposed to our doctrine”; 
also: “To say that the new obedience is the causa sine qua non 
contingit vita aeterna means to tread Christ and His blood under 
our feet.” 

While it is true that evil works destroy faith, Eph. 4, 30; 5, 5; 
1 Cor. 6, 9ff.; Gal. 5, 21; Korn. 8,13; Col. 3, 5. 6, it is not true 
that good works preserve faith. As a matter of fact, if works, 
even the best, are mingled into the article of justification and 
salvation, faith is destroyed and salvation rendered impossible. 
Gal. 3, 10; 5, 4. 

It is true, the good works of believers are tokens (indicia, 
testimonia) of their faith and state of grace (testimonium exter¬ 
num Spiritus Sancti de fide et statu gratiae); but they are not 
the causa sine qua non, much less the causa efficiens salutis. Those 
who teach that good works preserve faith deny the cardinal doc¬ 
trine of justification and salvation as taught in Scripture and the 
Lutheran Confessions and maintain the Semi-Pelagianistic error 
of the papists that faith saves inasmuch as it works by love (fides 
caritate formata). In other words, having rejected the sola fide, 
they base salvation on work-righteousness. 

Concerning the Scripture-passage Heb. 12,14, by which Ma- 
jorism endeavored to prove its false doctrine, it may be said: 

1) This passage presupposes faith and therefore also the possession 
of salvation, Eph. 2, 8. 9; John 5, 24; for the words are addressed 
to believing Christians, who should follow holiness because they 
already possess salvation, Heb. 12, 1. 2; Col. 3, Iff.; 2 Cor. 7, 1. 

2) They are a warning against carnal security, as the whole con¬ 
text shows, and thus are a part of the divine Law (sunt phrases

THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


legates), which must be applied to Christians who pervert faith 
(contra fucatam fIdem,) by neglecting sanctification, Heb. 12, 
15—17. The above passage therefore does not belong in the article 
of justification and salvation; in other words, it must not be used 
to mingle the Law into the Gospel, which was the fatal error of 
Majorism. 

But even in the realm of the new obedience, or sanctification, 
it is wrong to declare: “Good works are necessary for salvation.” 
The new obedience of the Christian is essentially the fulfilling of 
the Law, Bom. 13, 8—10, and as we cannot say: “The fulfilling of 
the Law is necessary for salvation,” so we can neither say that the 
new obedience (good works) is necessary for salvation. Majorism 
therefore must be condemned in both its original and modified 
form, both when it is applied to the article of justification and 
to that of sanctification. The Majoristic assertion “Good works are 
necessary for salvation” is intrinsically wrong and opposed to sound 
doctrine. 

In opposition to Majorism, Amsdorf asserted that “good works 
are injurious to salvation.” 

The Formula of Concord acknowledges that this statement 
originally meant to express the truth that good works are injurious 
to salvation provided the sinner puts his trust in them. In this 
sense, our Confession admits, good works are injurious to salvation. 

Its declaration reads (Thor. Decl., Art. IV, 37) : “As regards 
the proposition that good works are said to be injurious to salva¬ 
tion, we explain ourselves clearly as follows: If any one should 
wish to drag good works into the article of justification or rest his 
righteousness or trust for salvation upon them, to merit God’s grace 
and be saved by them, to this not we say, but St. Paul himself says, 
and repeats it three times, Phil. 3, 7 ff., that to such a man his works 
are not only useless and a hindrance, but also injurious. But this 
is not the fault of the good works themselves, but of the false con¬ 
fidence placed in the works, contrary to the express Word of God.” 

On the other hand, the Formula of Concord condemns the 
proposition of Amsdorf on three grounds: 1) because “in believers 
good works are indications (indicia) of salvation when they are 
done propter veras causas et ad veros fines (from true causes and 
for true ends,” Phil. 1, 28); 2) because “it is God’s will and ex¬ 
press command that believers should do good works, which the 
Holy Ghost works in believers”; and 3) because God “promises to 
them a glorious reward in this life and in the life to come.” For 



THE DOCTRINE OP SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


395 


these reasons we must not say “simpliciter and flatly”: “Good 
works are injurious to believers for, or as regards, their salvation”; 
but “this proposition is censured and rejected in our churches 
because as a flat statement it is false and offensive, by which disci¬ 
pline and decency might be impaired and a barbarous, dissolute, 
secure, epicurean life be introduced and strengthened.” (Ibid.) 

b. The statement “Sanctification and good works are neces¬ 
sary” is Scriptural and must therefore be maintained. Scripture 
speaks of the new obedience as a necessity, avayxr}, Rom. 13, 5; 
del, Acts 5, 29. Christian believers “must needs be subject to gov¬ 
ernments”; they “ought to obey God rather than men.” These 
Scriptural expressions must never be weakened or modified, but 
should be taught in their full meaning and force. Whenever mis¬ 
interpretations occur, these must be corrected; but the require¬ 
ments of the divine will should not be altered by man, nor should 
His Word be changed to please the carnal heart. Sanctification 
must be followed by the believer, and good works must be done 
by him, because God demands this (necessitate voluntatis et prae- 
cepti sive mandaii divini), 1 Thess. 4, 3; 1 John 3, 23. 

The Formula of Concord is very insistent in inculcating the 
necessity of sanctification and good works. It says (Thor. Decl., 
IY, 31. 32) : “The false epicurean delusion is to be earnestly cen¬ 
sured and rejected, namely, that some imagine that faith and the 
righteousness and salvation which they have received can be lost 
through no sins or wicked deeds, not even through wilful and 
intentional ones, but that a Christian, although he indulges his 
wicked lusts without fear and shame, resists the Holy Ghost, and 
purposely engages in sins against conscience, yet none the less 
retains faith, God’s grace, righteousness, and salvation. Against 
this pernicious delusion the following true, immutable, divine 
threats and severe punishments and admonitions should be often 
repeated and impressed upon Christians who are justified by faith: 
1 Cor. 6, 9; Gal. 5, 21; Eph. 5, 5; Rom. 8,13; Col. 3, 6.” 

While the Formula of Concord thus emphasizes the necessity 
of good works, it at the same time stresses the fact that it under¬ 
stands this necessity not as a necessitas coactionis (a necessity of 
coercion), but as a necessitas ordinis, mandati et voluntatis Christi 
ac debiti nostri (a necessity of Christ’s ordinance, command, and 
will, and of our obligation), since it is true that “truly good works 
should be done willingly or from a voluntary spirit by those whom 
the Son of God has made free,” Ps. 110, 3; 54, 6; 2 Cor. 9, 7; 



396 


THE DOCTRINE OF 8ANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


Rom. 6,17. It says (Thor. Decl., IV, 16.17): “When this word 
necessity is employed, it should be understood not of coercion, but 
only of the ordinance of the immutable will of God. (Vult enim 
mandatum Dei, ut creatura suo Creatori obediat.)” 

If the question is asked for whose sake believers should do 
good works, the answer is: 1) For God’s sake, whom they serve 
with holy works, Rom. 12,1. 2; 2) for their own sake, namely, that 
they may have true indications (indicia, testimonia) of their state 
of grace, 1 John 3,14; Matt. 6,14.15; 1 Pet. 2, 9, since the new 
obedience and good works of believers are really the testimonium 
Spiritus Sancti externum; 3) for the sake of the children of the 
world, to whom believers should prove the truth and power of the 
Gospel by a holy life, so that thereby they may be induced to hear 
the Word of God and be saved, 1 Pet. 2, 12; 3, 1. 2; Matt. 5, 
13—16. 

Yet this new obedience does not flow from the coercion of the 
Law, Rom. 7, 22, though the Law serves also the believer as 
a mirror, curb, and guide, Ps. 1, 2; 119,1; 1 Cor. 9, 27; Rom. 7, 
18. 19; Deut. 12, 8. 28. 32, — a fact that must be maintained 
against every form of Antinomianism (John Agricola, ca. 1535),— 
but from faith in the precious Gospel of Christ, which inscribes 
the Law into the heart, Jer. 31, 31 ff., and thus makes the believer 
willing to, and zealous of, every good work, Ps. 110, 3; 2 Cor. 9, 7; 
1 Pet. 5, 1—4. The terms willing and free, etc., must, however, 
not be interpreted in the sense “that it were optional with them 
[the believers] to do or to omit them [good works] or that they 
might or could act contrary to the Law of God and none the less 
could retain faith and God’s favor and grace.” ( Formula of Con¬ 
cord, Thor. Decl., Art. IV, 20.) 

6. THE IMPERFECTION OF CHRISTIAN SANCTIFICATION 

IN THIS LIFE. 

While justification is complete and therefore admits of no 
degrees, sanctification, on account of the remaining sinfulness of 
the flesh, Rom. 7, 24, is never complete, or perfect, in this life, Phil. 
3,12—14, but gradual and susceptible of constant growth, Eph. 4, 
15.16; Col. 2,19. This truth, which is so prominently impressed 
upon believers by Scripture, is of the greatest importance for the 
proper understanding of their Christian duties. 

Of the imperfection of Christian sanctification in this life, 
Quenstedt writes: “Renovation [sanctification] in this life is 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


397 


partial and imperfect, admitting degrees, and therefore never 
attains the highest pinnacles of perfection. For sin remains in the 
regenerate, affecting their self-control, and the flesh lusts against 
the Spirit; wherefore our renovation progresses from day to day 
and is to be continued through life, 2 Cor. 4,16. The want of per¬ 
fection in renovation does not arise from the impotency of God, 
who renews, but from the weakness of man, who is the recipient 
of divine action.” (Doctr. Theol., p. 490.) 

And again: “Renovation is increased by godly acts and fre¬ 
quent efforts. If these are intermitted or diminished, a diminution 
follows, so that at one time there is an increase, at another a de¬ 
crease. The Holy Scriptures expressly affirm that the renovation 
of the regenerate in this life ought continually to increase and 
grow, Eph. 4,16.” 

These quotations show how earnestly our Lutheran dogma- 
ticians stress the imperfection of Christian sanctification and the 
daily need of the believer to strive after progress in the grace of 
holiness. Our Lutheran teachers indeed acknowledge the fact that 
the regenerate, according to the new man, are spiritual, 1 Cor. 2,15; 
14, 37; Gal. 6,1, but, on the other hand, they affirm that the regen¬ 
erate are also carnal, Rom. 7,14, namely, so far as their evil flesh 
(odpi) is concerned, Rom. 7,22. 23. 

Hollaz comments on this as follows: “When a renewed man 
is called spiritual, the reason why he is so denominated is derived 
from that which is preponderant, namely, from the prevailing 
spirit (the inward or new man); but when the same (the renewed 
man) is called carnal, the reason is derived from that which is 
subordinate, namely, from the flesh, which is indeed subdued, but 
yet rebels and resists and with which the justified person, placed 
in the way of life, is continually carrying on war.” {Doctr. Theol., 
p. 491.) 

The doctrine of the imperfection of Christian sanctification is 
well supported by Scripture. From the viewpoint of their imper¬ 
fections it admonishes believers “to grow up into Christ in all 
things,” Eph. 4,15; “to abound in every good work,” 2 Cor. 9, 8; 
“to abound in the work of the Lord,” 1 Cor. 15, 58; “to increase 
in the knowledge of God,” Col. 1,10; “to be strengthened with 
all might . . . unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness,” 
Col. 1,11; “to increase and abound in love one toward another and 
toward all men,” 1 Thess. 3,12; “to abound yet more and more in 



398 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


the knowledge and in all judgment,” Phil. 1, 9; “to abound more 
and more in pleasing God,” 1 Thess. 4,1; etc. 

All these exhortations show that the Christian believer, ac¬ 
cording to the old man (naXaiog av&Qamos), who is still in him, 
is very imperfect indeed and that his whole life must be a perpetual 
effort to overcome his evil inclinations, struggle against sin, and 
accomplish that which is good in the sight of God. 

The Formula of Concord aptly remarks (Thor. Decl., II, 68): 
“Since we receive in this life only the first-fruits of the Spirit and 
the new birth is not complete, but only begun in us (regeneratio 
nondum sit absoluta, sed solummodo in nobis inchoata), the combat 
and struggle of the flesh against the spirit remains even in the 
elect and truly regenerate men; for there is a great difference 
perceptible among Christians, not only in this, that one is weak 
and another strong in the spirit, but each Christian moreover expe¬ 
riences in himself that at one time he is joyful in spirit and at 
another fearful and alarmed; at one time ardent in love, strong 
in faith and hope, and at another cold and weak.” 

In order to impress this point, our dogmaticians have said: 
“The righteousness of faith, or our imputed righteousness, is per¬ 
fect or complete; the righteousness of life, or our inherent right¬ 
eousness, is imperfect, begun, and incomplete.” Iustitia fidei sive 
imputata perfecta sive consummata est, iustitia vitae sive inhaerens 
imperfecta, inchoata, non consummata. (Baier.) 

There is, then, in the believer a constant warfare between his 
new man ( vovg , ioco fiv&gamos, xaivog Sv&gcoTtog) and between 
his flesh (odg£), as St. Paul clearly shows Bom. 7,26. (Cp. Luther, 
St. L., XY, 1552.) 

The doctrine of the imperfection of Christian sanctification 
must be held and defended in all its Scriptural truth and force 
against the error of perfectionism (papists, Unitarians, Arminians 
[Limborch], enthusiasts [Weigel, Schwenkfeld, etc.], Methodists, 
Finney of Oberlin, etc.). 

While the error of perfectionism is taught in different forms, 
so that we must carefully distinguish between various types of this 
delusion (papistic, Methodist, Oberlin, etc.), the Formula of Con¬ 
cord adequately defines this false doctrine in a general way when 
it writes (Epit., II, 12): “[We reject also the error that] man, 
after he has been born again, can perfectly observe and completely 
fulfil God’s Law,” “that a Christian who is truly regenerated by

God’s Spirit can perfectly observe and fulfil the Law of God in this 
life” (Epit., XII, 25). 

That, in general, is the essence of perfectionism. It is based 
on the unscriptural premise that only those transgressions that are 
done consciously and deliberately are truly to be called sins. 
Cp. Wesley: “I believe a person filled with love of God is still 
liable to involuntary transgressions. Such transgressions you call 
sins if you please; I do not.” Strong, Syst. Theol., 878. Cp. also 
The Decisions of the Council of Trent , Sess. V, Decretum de pec- 
cato originali, 5. 

In its consequences, perfectionism means defection from the 
article of justification by faith (sola fide), because saving faith can 
dwell only in a contrite heart, which by daily repentance (contrition 
and faith) lays hold of the merits of Christ to cover its sins. In 
other words, a true believer never denies his sinfulness (original 
and actual), but always confesses his sins before God, Ps. 32, 5; 
38, Iff.; 51, Iff.; 90,8; 143,2, etc. In view of this fact, perfec¬ 
tionism must be condemned as a species of self-righteousness, Luke 
18,11.12, which is as offensive as it is pernicious. Its culmination 
is found in the blatant boast of Romanism that there are saints 
whose supreme holiness even produces supererogatory works (opera 
supererogationis), that is, works which are more than sufficient 
and can therefore be dispensed to others who are lacking in 
perfection. 

Against perfectionism Scripture attests that, “if we say that 
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us”; 
indeed, that, “if we say that we have not sinned, we make Him 
a liar, and His Word is not in us,” 1 John 1, 8.10. It is true, the 
same apostle who wrote these words said also: ‘‘Whosoever, is born 
of God doth not commit sin; for His seed remaineth in him; and 
he cannot sin because he is born of God,” 1 John 3, 9. However, 
in this passage he describes the believer according to the new man 
(“because he is born of God”) and not according to his corrupt 
nature (odpf), from which all his transgressions after conversion 
flow. The believer indeed “has sin,” 1 John 1,8.10, and he is for¬ 
given and cleansed from all unrighteousness, 1 John 1,9, only if he 
confesses his sins. At the same time he, as a new creature in Christ, 
is no longer under the dominion of sin “that he should obey it in 
the lusts thereof,” Rom. 6,12.14. When a true believer sins, it is 
not his regenerated self or the new man in him that sins, but his 
Old Adam, or his corrupt flesh.

THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


St.John, in the passage just quoted (1 John 3,9), thus sup¬ 
ports St. Paul, who says of himself: “Now, then, it is no more 

1 that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me,” Eom. 7,17. This he 
explains further by saying: “For I delight in the Law of God 
after the inward man; but I see another law in my members, 
warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into cap¬ 
tivity to the law of sin which is in my members,” Eom. 7, 22. 23. 
Perfectionism can therefore be proved neither by 1 John 3, 9 nor 
by Eom. 6,14. 

In passing, we may say that the error of perfectionism is itself 
an outgrowth of the evil nature (odg£), or the conceited reason of 
man, which refuses to humble itself before God, Luke 18, 9; 

2 Pet. 2,18. 19; 1 Pet. 5, 5. 6. 

The fact that sanctification in this life is gradual and incom¬ 
plete (renovatio inchoata, imperfecta) must not be abused by the 
Christian in such a manner that he makes no efforts towards sanc¬ 
tification. On the contrary, it should constantly move the believer 
to strive after holiness in the fear of God. While perfect sanctifica¬ 
tion is impossible in this life, it should nevertheless be the Chris¬ 
tian’s supreme goal. 

That is God’s will, 1 Cor. 1, 30; 2 Thess. 2,13; Heb. 12,14; 
1 Thess. 4, 3—7; etc. His demand is that the believer “cleanse 
himself from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holi¬ 
ness in the fear of God,” 2 Cor. 7,1, and that he be “holy in all 

manner of conversation,” 1 Pet. 1, 15. Negatively, the believer 

should put off every sin; positively, he should put on every virtue; 
for only a life of perfect holiness becomes him as a saint of God 
in Christ Jesus, Col. 1, 10; Phil. 4, 8; cp. also Col. 3; Eph. 5 
and 6; Eom. 12—15; etc. Thus Holy Scripture not only multi¬ 
plies its exhortations to holiness, but also sets before the believer 

the lofty standard of perfection. Matt. 6, 24; Luke 14, 25—35; 

Matt. 7,13.14; 18,8.9; etc. The life of faith means a life of 
absolute self-denial and self-mortification, 1 Cor. 9, 25. 27. 

In fact, God in His holy Word demands of the believer so per¬ 
fect a degree of sanctification that the question indeed forces itself 
upon the trembling, penitent heart: “Who, then, can be saved?” 
Matt. 19, 25. Christ’s reply to this query: “With men this is im¬ 
possible; but with God all things are possible,” Matt. 19,26, con¬ 
firms the truth taught in so many passages of Scripture that the 
standard of Christian perfection which God has set is so high that 
only His grace can save us, Eph. 2, 8. 9. 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


401 


In view of these facts the unspeakable folly of perfectionism 
becomes obvious. That this doctrine was ever taught in the Church 
is due to the pernicious mingling of Law and Gospel, which always 
occurred when Christians apostatized from the Word of God and 
resorted to doctrines of the flesh. Papism, Arminianism, Unitari- 
anism, etc., teach perfectionism because, on the one hand, they have 
weakened the stern demands of the divine Law and, on the other, 
have dimmed the perfect glory of God’s grace in Christ Jesus. 
First they taught salvation by work-righteousness; after this pagan 
doctrine had become rooted in their system of teaching, the “epi¬ 
curean delusion” of perfectionism was bound to follow. First their 
conceited reason said: “I can do good works to merit salvation”; 
then it arrogantly added: “I can do more good works than are 
required for salvation.” 

Accordingly we must not say: “If the doctrine of sinless per¬ 
fection is a heresy, the doctrine of contentment with sinful imper¬ 
fection is a greater heresy” (A. J. Gordon; cp. Christl. Dogmatik, 
Vol. Ill, p. 40), but rather: “Both are intolerable heresies, which 
render salvation impossible.” 

However, in the final analysis, perfectionism itself is neglect 
and repudiation of Christian sanctification, since the self-sufficient 
perfectionist, denying his exceeding sinfulness, refuses to follow 
the course which God in His Word prescribes for Christian sanc¬ 
tification. True sanctification occurs only when a believer by daily 
sincere repentance (poenitentia quotidiana, poenitentia stantium) 
humbly beseeches God to forgive his manifold sins for Christ’s sake 
and then, in the strength of faith and trusting in the grace of God, 
renews his fight against sin and his consecration to holiness. True 
sanctification thus presupposes continual study of the Law for the 
purpose of obtaining an ever greater knowledge of sin and of God’s 
demands, continual meditation on the Gospel for an ever greater 
assurance of forgiveness, and continual mindfulness of the goal 
which the pilgrim of Christ (homo viator) must attain on his road 
to heaven, his real home ( homo comprehensor , Phil. 3, 20. 21). 
The life of true sanctification is a life in Christ, unto God, by 
the power of the Holy Spirit, in view of the hope of eternal 
glory (sub specie aetemitatis; Heb. 13,14: ttjv psXXovoav [jioXtv] 
im^Tjrovjuev). 

With regard to the argument of the perfectionists that God 
does not command the impossible, Matt. 5,48, we reject this as 
a fallacy and declare: A praecepto ad posse non valet consequentia.

CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



402 


THE DOCTHINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


With respect to the Scripture-passages which perfectionists adduce 
to support their error, we may say in summary: 1 John 3, 9 de¬ 
scribes the Christian according to the new man; Phil. 3,15 speaks 
of the Christian’s striving after perfection; Heb. 5, 13. 14 sets 
forth the perfection of maturity; Matt. 5,48 commands love like 
God’s, not regarding quantity, but quality; Col. 2,10 teaches the 
perfection of justification. 

In conclusion, we wish to remind the reader once more of the 
important fact that the article of sanctification can be kept pure 
only in case the article of justification is taught in its Scriptural 
purity. Those who err with respect to justification must err also 
with regard to sanctification. 

To this great truth the Formula of Concord directs attention 
when it says (Thor. Decl., III, 22) : “When we teach that through 
the operation of the Holy Ghost we are born anew and justified, 
the sense is not that after regeneration no unrighteousness clings 
any more to the justified and regenerate in their being and life, 
but that Christ covers all their sins, which nevertheless in this life 
still inhere in nature, with His complete obedience. But irrespec¬ 
tive of this they are declared and regarded godly and righteous by 
faith and for the sake of Christ’s obedience, . . . although on ac¬ 
count of their corrupt nature they still are and remain sinners to 
the grave. ... Nor, on the other hand, is this the meaning, that 
without repentance, conversion, and renewal we might or should 
yield to sins and remain and continue in them.” 

And again (ibid., 32) : “It is also correctly said that believers, 
who in Christ through faith have been justified, have in this life 
first the imputed righteousness of faith and then also the incipient 
righteousness of the new obedience, or of good works. But these 
two must not be mingled with one another or be both injected at 
the same time into the article of justification by faith before God. 
For since this incipient righteousness or renewal in us is incom¬ 
plete and impure in this life because of the flesh, the person cannot 
stand with and by it . . . before God’s tribunal, but before God’s 
tribunal only the righteousness of the obedience, suffering, and 
death of Christ, which is imputed to faith, can stand, so that only 
for the sake of this obedience is the person (even after his renewal, 
when he has already many good works and lives the best . . . life) 
pleasing and acceptable to God and is received into adoption and 
heirship of eternal life.” (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, p. 41 ff.; 
also Luther, St. L., XV, 1551. 1554.) 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


403 


7. THE DOCTRINE OF GOOD WORKS. 

(De Bonis Operibus.) 

We shall treat the doctrine of good works under three heads: 
a) Definition of Good Works; b) The Works of the Heathen; and 
c) The Christian’s Growth in Good Works. 

A. DEFINITION OF GOOD WORKS. 

Good works, according to Holy Scripture, are the fruits of 
justifying faith, 1 John 5, 4; Gal. 2, 20; 5, 6; Heb. 11, 4—39. 
Hence, when we speak of good works in the strict Scriptural sense 
of the term, we include every thought, desire, word, and deed which 
a believer does through faith in Christ Jesus. The element of 
faith is therefore rightly stressed in all definitions which our dog- 
maticians have given of good works. 

Hollaz defines good works thus: “Good works are free acts of 
justified persons, performed through the renewing grace of the 
Holy Spirit according to the prescription of the divine Law, true 
faith in Christ preceding, to the honor of God and the edification 
of men.” (Doctr, Theol., p.493.) So also the Augsburg Confes¬ 
sion says (Art. XX, 28—30): “It is only by faith that forgive¬ 
ness of sins is apprehended, and that for nothing. And because 
through faith the Holy Ghost is received, hearts are renewed and 
endowed with new affections, so as to be able to bring forth good 
works. For Ambrose says: ' Faith is the mother of a good will 
and right doing! ” Faith in Christ is therefore the true source 
from which all truly good works flow. 

In opposition to the false definition of good works current in 
papistic theology Hollaz emphasizes the fact that also the “internal 
affections of the heart and the movements of the will” which flow 
from faith must be regarded as good works. He writes: “By works 
here are understood not only external visible actions (which pro¬ 
ceed from the hand or tongue), but internal affections of the heart 
and movements of the will and thus the entire obedience and 
inherent righteousness of the regenerate. A distinction is there¬ 
fore to be made between internal and external good works. The 
former are seen by the eyes of God alone and comprise the inner 
thoughts of the mind, the movements of the will, and the pure 
affections of the heart (such as love, the fear of God, confidence 
toward God, patience, humility). The latter are seen not only 
by God, but likewise by man and manifest themselves by outward 
demeanor, words, and actions.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 493.) 



404 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


It is necessary to remember this point whenever the doctrine 
of good works is being considered; for otherwise one’s definition 
of good works may become too narrow and exclude from their 
sphere many elements that properly belong to it. 

Our Lutheran dogmaticians were compelled to set forth and 
defend the Scriptural doctrine of good works especially in oppo¬ 
sition to the papistic perversion of it. For this reason they were 
obliged, in the first place, to determine the true norm of Chris¬ 
tian good works. According to Scripture the norm, or standard, 
of good works is a) neither man’s own will (Col. 2, 23: “will- 
worship”; cp. Luther, St. L., I, 866ff.); b) nor the will of other 
men (Ezek. 20,18 : “neither observe their judgments”; Col. 2,16 : 
“Let no man judge you”); c) nor the will of the Church (Matt. 

15, 9: “teaching for doctrines the commandments of men”); 
d) nor even the “good intention” of man, 1 Sam. 15, 22; John 

16, 2; Acts 26, 9; but e) alone the revealed Word and will of God 
(Deut. 5, 32: “Ye shall observe to do as the Lord, your God, hath 
commanded you”; Matt. 4,10: “Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy 
God, and Him only shalt thou serve”). (Bona opera sunt actiones, 
quae secundum Dei legem e fide proficiscuntur.) To disregard the 
Word of God as the norm of good works is tantamount to apostasy 
from God and therefore to gross idolatry, 1 Sam. 15, 22. 23. 

Luther rightly remarks: “Scripture calls it a most horrible 
sorcery, idolatry, and idol-service not to listen to the Word of God, 
but to purpose to do something without or against God’s Word; 
and this is indeed a most dreadful verdict, especially when you see 
how common this is and how much it is done in the world.” 
(St. L., I, 866.) 

This judgment is true. All who put as a source and rule of 
faith the commandments of men in the place of God’s Word 
degrade themselves by becoming “slaves of men,” 1 Cor. 7, 23; 
in fact, by their unlawful obedience they really honor men as gods. 
Even the sufferings (das Kreuz) of Christians dare be imposed 
only by God, 1 Pet. 3,17, and should not be self-chosen, 1 Pet. 4, 
15. 16.19: (naoxovreg xazd zo •deXrjp.a zov deov). 

Quenstedt is right in saying: “The directing norm according 
to which good works are to be done and judged is the word of 
the divine Law, which offers an absolutely perfect rule of right¬ 
eousness and divine holiness and prescribes both what should be 
done and what should be omitted.” (II, 1387; cp. Christl. Dog- 
matik. III, 45.) “Truly good works are not those which every

405 


one contrives himself from a good intention or which are done 
according to traditions of men, but those which God Himself has 
prescribed and commanded.” ( Triglot, p. 939.) 

By setting up false standards of “good works” (man’s own 
devotion, the commandments of the Church, the infamous system 
of morals established by the Jesuits), the Church of Borne proves 
that it is the Church of Antichrist. Luther rightly condemned the 
fictitious holiness of the monks and nuns and praised the true 
holiness of works performed by all believers in the humblest calling 
as works hallowed by God’s commandments. (St. L., IX, 952 ff.) 

The rule just stated is not weakened by the fact that God in 
His Word commands subjects to be obedient to the civil govern¬ 
ment and children to their parents, Eph. 6,1 ff.; Col. !, 20; Bom. 
13, 1—7, provided, of course, that the government and parents 
do not command anything that is in opposition to His own com¬ 
mandments, Acts 5, 29. All lawful commands of governments and 
parents are God’s own commandments since He Himself has given 
them authority to rule. The same applies to Christian ministers 
whenever in the name of God and by authority of His Word they 
command or exhort their hearers to do what God enjoins upon 
them, Heb. 13, 7; 1 Thess. 5,12.13; 1 Tim. 5,17.18. In all other 
cases, however, Christians should not recognize as a norm of their 
works the will or commandments of other men, Matt. 15, 9; Gal. 2, 
3. 5. 11—14. Under given circumstances it even becomes the 
sacred duty of Christians to renounce human norms and standards, 
namely, in all cases where these conflict with the Word of God, 
Gal. 5,1—3. 

So, then, the norm of good works is not the will of men, 
Matt. 15, 9; not conscience, John 16, 2; Acts 26, 9ff.; not the 
Law of Moses as given to the Jews, containing both ceremonial and 
political elements designed only for the Old Testament, Lev. 11; 
Num. 15, 32ff., cp. with Col. 2,16.17; not the special command¬ 
ments given to individual persons, Gen. 22,1 ff.; not the Church, 
Matt. 23, 8; Mark 7,7; but only the Moral Law of God, or His 
“immutable will,” as this is revealed to us in clear passages of the 
Old Testament and the New Testament, Matt. 22, 37—40; Bom. 
13,10. Men may err; conscience is fallible; the temporary laws 
of the Old Testament have been abolished; the special command¬ 
ments were limited to individuals; the Church itself is subject to 
God’s Word; but the Moral Law, or the immutable will of God, 
stands forever as the norm and rule of Christian life, John 12, 48. 



406 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


In his Large Catechism, Luther writes very emphatically on 
the norm of good works: “Therefore I constantly say that all our 
life and work must be ordered according to God’s Word if it is to 
be God-pleasing and holy. Where this is done, this commandment 
[the Third Commandment] is in force and is being fulfilled. On 
the contrary, any observance or work that is practised without God’s 
Word is unholy before God, no matter how brilliantly it may shine, 
even though it be covered with relics, such as the fictitious spiritual 
orders, which know nothing of God’s Word and seek holiness in 
their own works.” ( Triglot, p. 607, §§ 92. 93. Cp. also Luther’s 
sermon on Titus 2,13; St. L., IX, 952ff.) 

On the basis of Scripture our dogmaticians have always pointed 
out igainst 'he Romanists that the “good intention” of the doer 
can never make any work good, nor can it change an evil work 
into a good work. 

Though the Moral Law, or the immutable will of God, as 
revealed in Holy Scripture, is the norm of good works, yet it is 
not their source; for truly good works of Christians are not “works 
of the Law,” but “fruits of the Spirit.” Between the two the 
Formula of Concord rightly distinguishes as follows (Epit., YI, 
5. 6): “The works which are done according to the Law are, and 
are called, works of the Law as long as they are only extorted from 
man by urging the punishment and threatening of God’s wrath. 
Fruits of the Spirit, however, are the works which the Spirit of 
God, who dwells in believers, works through the regenerate and 
which are done by believers so far as they are regenerate (spon¬ 
taneously and freely), as though they knew of no command, threat, 
or reward; for in this manner the children of God live in the Law 
and walk according to the Law of God, which St. Paul in his 
epistles calls the Law of Christ and the Law of the mind, Rom. 
7,25: 8,7; 8,2; Gal. 6,2.” 

As the Formula of Concord here correctly teaches, all good 
works of the regenerate flow from a willing spirit, or from love 
toward God. This is a clear doctrine of Scripture, Ps. 110, 3; 
54, 6; Rom. 6,18; 7, 22 ff.; 2 Cor. 9, 7. In fact, every work which 
does not flow from love toward God is a transgression of God’s 
Law; for “love is the fulfilling of the Law,” Rom. 13, 8—10. It is 
for this reason that Luther so emphatically begins his explanations 
of the Ten Commandments with the words: “We should fear and 
love God”; for by these words he indicates the true source from 
which all obedience to the Law must come. 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


407 


From this it is clear that true obedience to the divine Law 
is rendered only by true Christians, whom the Holy Spirit has 
endowed with spiritual powers through faith, Phil. 4,13. Unbe¬ 
lievers perform only externally good works, as these flow either 
from natural love toward those whom they serve (parents, children, 
country, etc.) or from ambition or love of fame and praise, as also 
from the desire to earn salvation by good works. Because of their 
remaining evil nature also the regenerate may be misled to do 
good works from these motives. But all “good works” which are 
done after the flesh are sinful and worthless before God. (Opera 
bona non-renatorum coram Deo sunt peccata.) 

However, after the inward man, or as new creatures in Christ, 
believers perform good works from love and gratitude toward Him 
who is their Father in Christ Jesus, 1 John 4,19. Such spiritual 
works are not designed to earn heaven, but are prompted by the 
joyful assurance that in Christ they already have heaven. Bom. 
12,1. (Cp. Luther, St. L., XII, 136.) Luther therefore is right 
in saying that first the person must be good before his works can 
he good; that is to say, a person must be sanctified through faith 
in Christ before his works can please God. 

So also the Apology says (III, 4): “After we are justified by 
faith and regenerated, we begin to fear God, to love, to ask and 
expect assistance of Him. . . . We begin likewise to love our neigh¬ 
bors, because our hearts have spiritual and holy emotions. These 
things cannot take place unless, being justified by faith and regen¬ 
erated, we receive the Holy Spirit.” This is the meaning also of 
the theological axiom: “Good works must not only be good, they 
must also be done in a good manner” (bene fieri debent), i. e., they 
must be done in faith, Heb. 11, 6. 

Though the good works of believers flow from faith, they 
nevertheless are not perfect in themselves, since they are tainted 
by the sin and corruption which still cleaves to their flesh, Bom. 
7,14—19. Their good works are either not done entirely and ex¬ 
clusively according to the norm of the divine Law (other motives 
or considerations prompting their actions), or they are not done 
with an altogether free and willing spirit, they being prompted 
in part by the threats of the Law, Bom. 7, 22. 23. For this reason 
the good works of the believers are qualitatively deficient, or not as 
perfect as God desires them to be, Gal. 6, 8. 

To this we must add also a deficiency in quantity, for the 
Christian never performs so many good works as he should, Gal. 



408 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


6,9.10; 2 Cor. 8, 7.10.11; 1 Cor. 16,1. 2. The good works of 
the regenerate are therefore never “good” in the strict sense of the 
term, or, what is the same, they never measure up to the perfect 
standard of the divine will, Rom. 7, 24. 25. If they are accepted as 
good by God, it is only because the perfect righteousness of Christ, 
which the believer appropriates by faith, covers their imperfections. 
In other words, God mercifully forgives their inadequacy for 
Christ’s sake, 1 John 2,1. 2. 

The Formula of Concord thus writes (Thor. Decl., TV, 8) : 
“Nor is there a controversy as to how and why the good works of 
believers, although in this flesh they are impure and incomplete, 
are pleasing and acceptable to God, namely, for Christ’s sake, by 
faith, because the person is acceptable to God.” And again (Thor. 
Decl., VI, 22): “But how and why the good works of believers, 
although in this life they are imperfect and impure because of sin 
in the flesh, are nevertheless acceptable and well-pleasing to God 
is not taught by the Law, which requires an altogether perfect, 
pure obedience if it is to please God. But the Gospel teaches that 
our spiritual offerings are acceptable to God through faith for 
Christ’s sake, 1 Pet. 2, 5; Heb. 11, 4ff.” 

So also Quenstedt declares: “The works of the regenerate, in 
themselves considered, are not perfectly good, but are rendered 
sordid and polluted by the stain of sin; but in Christ they are- 
perfectly good, and in such a sense that what is not done in them 
is pardoned through and on account of Christ, and what they 
lack in perfection is compensated for by the imputation of the 
most perfect obedience of Christ.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 493.) The 
fact, then, remains that the blood of Jesus Christ, God’s Son, must 
cleanse us also from the sinfulness of our good works, 1 John 1, 7. 

B. THE WORKS OF THE HEATHEN. 

Since St. Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans, avers that the 
heathen <f by nature do the things contained in the Law,” Rom. 2, 
14.15; cp. also 1,19. 20. 32, it is necessary to consider the ques¬ 
tion in what sense also the heathen or the unregenerate can do good 
works. While it is true that, properly speaking, only those works 
can be called good that flow from faith and true love of God, Heb. 
11, 6, we may nevertheless apply the term “good” to all works of 
the unregenerate that are done according to the norm of the divine 
Law written in their hearts, Rom. 2,15 ; 1, 32, such as feeding the 
hungry, clothing the naked, helping the oppressed, being diligent

409 


in one’s calling, etc. Luther once said that, viewed externally, 
these works frequently surpass those of the believers; for “Alex¬ 
ander the Great, Julius Caesar, and Scipio accomplished greater 
deeds than ever a Christian” (St. L., II, 461 ff.). 

But despite this fact both Luther and our Lutheran Confes¬ 
sions declare that the difference between the good works of believers 
and unbelievers is one of kind and not one of degree; that is to 
say, the good works of the unregenerate do not properly belong in 
the class of Christian good works at all, but are good only out¬ 
wardly (quoad materiale), not inwardly (quoad formale). Luther 
says: “Cursed are all works which are not done in love.” (St. L., 
X, 407; cp. also VII, 1862.) 

The works of unbelievers are indeed also actuated by God, not, 
however, in His Kingdom of Grace (regnum gratiae), where the 
Holy Spirit produces spiritually good works (iustitia spiritualis) 
through the means of grace, but in His Kingdom of Power (regnum, 
potentiae), where God, for the purpose of preserving this world, 
effects civilly good works (iustitia civilis), or externally good works 
(opera externa), through His divine Law inscribed in the heart 
of man. These externally good works (iustitia civilis) are neces¬ 
sary for the welfare of human society, and hence God rewards them 
with temporal blessings in His Kingdom of Power. In this sense, 
then, the works of the unregenerate may be called good; they are 
done according to the divine norm and accomplish much temporal 
good in the domain of the earthly life. 

But when these works are considered with regard to the source 
from which all spiritually good works flow, namely, faith, a regen¬ 
erate heart, the new life in Christ, etc., we cannot call them good 
at all, but must condemn them as utterly sinful. The reason for 
this is evident. Holy Scripture declares without qualification that 
all unregenerate persons are “dead in trespasses and sins,” Eph. 
2,1; “alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is 
in them,” Eph. 4,18; “without God and having no hope in this 
world,” Eph. 2,12; and addicted to “dumb idols,” 1 Cor. 12, 2, so 
that what they sacrifice “they sacrifice to devils and not to God,” 
1 Cor. 10, 20. 

It is significant that both Romanists and Romanizing Prot¬ 
estants regard the works of “moral heathen” as good, meritorious, 
and even as saving. This proves that they understand neither the 
Law nor the Gospel. They regard the works of the heathen as 



410 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


good because they themselves teach the pagan doctrine of work¬ 
righteousness and have thus fallen from grace. 

Since, therefore, the unregenerate are in a state of spiritual 
ignorance and hopelessness, they certainly are unable to do good 
works from spiritual motives. Moreover, as they themselves dis¬ 
please God, Titus 1,16; Ps. 53,1—3, so also their works displease 
Him, since they are evil. Matt. 12, 33; Luke 6, 43. 44. Hence with 
respect to the good works of the unregenerate we maintain this 
distinction: In the sphere of God’s Kingdom of Power (regnum 
potential), or of earthly matters, they may be called good; in the 
sphere of His Kingdom of Grace (regnum gratiae), or of spiritual 
things, they are sin (Augustine: "glittering vices”). 

This is the clear teaching of our Confessions. The Augsburg 
Confession (Art. XVIII) declares: "Although nature is able in 
a manner to do the outward work, [for it is able to keep the hands 
from theft and murder,] yet it cannot produce the inward motions, 
such as the fear of God, trust in God, chastity, patience, etc.” 

The Apology says (Art. IV [II], 3311.): “If the carnal mind 
is enmity against God, the flesh certainly does not love God; if it 
cannot be subject to the Law of God, it cannot love God. If the 
carnal mind is enmity against God, the flesh sins even when we 
do external, civil works. If it cannot be subject to the Law of God, 
it certainly sins even when, according to human judgment, it per¬ 
forms deeds that are excellent and worthy of praise. The adver¬ 
saries consider only the precepts of the Second Table, which con¬ 
tain civil righteousness that reason understands. Content with 
this, they think that they satisfy the Law of God. In the mean 
time they do not see the First Table, which commands that we love 
God, that we declare as certain that God is angry with sin, that we 
truly fear God, that we declare as certain that God hears prayer. 
But the human heart without the Holy Ghost either in security 
despises God’s judgment or in punishment flees from, and hates, 
God when He judges. Therefore it does not obey the First Table. 
Since, therefore, contempt of God and doubt concerning the threats 
and promises inhere in human nature, men truly sin even when, 
without the Holy Ghost, they do virtuous works because they do 
them with a wicked heart, according to Rom. 14, 23. . . . For such 
persons perform their works with contempt of God, just as Epi¬ 
curus does not believe that God cares for him or that he is re¬ 
garded as heard by God. This contempt vitiates works seemingly 
virtuous, because God judges the heart.” 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


411 


The Formula of Concord, quoting Luther, writes (Thor. Decl., 
II, 43) : “Herewith I [Luther] reject and condemn as nothing but 
error all dogmas which extol our free will, as they directly conflict 
with this help and grace of our Savior Jesus Christ. For since 
outside of Christ death and sin are our lords and the devil [is] our 
god and prince, there can be no power or might, no wisdom or 
understanding, whereby we can qualify ourselves for, or strive after, 
righteousness and life; but we must be blinded people and prisoners 
of sin and the devil’s own to do and to think what pleases them 
and is contrary to God and His commandments.” 

Since, then, all works which do not flow from faith in Christ 
are, spiritually considered, sin before God, it is obvious why man 
by nature cannot qualify himself for grace or cooperate in his con¬ 
version and why therefore conversion is alone the work of God 
(monergism of divine grace). Those errorists who teach man’s 
cooperation in conversion (Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians [papists], 
Arminians, synergists) deny also the Scriptural truth that the 
good works of the unregenerate are, spiritually considered, sin 
before God. The Council of Trent (Sess. VI, Can. 7) has even 
anathematized those who on the basis of Scripture affirm this 
doctrine. (Si quis diixerit, opera omnia, quae ante iustificationem 
fiunt, quacumque ratione sint, vere esse peccata vel odium Dei 
mereri — anathema sit.) 

Among modem Protestant theologians, Hofmann assumed 
that also the heathen will finally be justified on the basis of their 
good works which they did in agreement with conscience ( Schrift- 
betveis, I, 470 ff.). We reject this unscriptural doctrine as a figment 
of reason, Eph. 2,12. If Unitarians [Modernists] ascribe to the 
unregenerate good works in the strict sense of the term, this is only 
consistent with their general unbiblical system of belief; for they 
themselves boast of good works though they are outside the Church 
(extra ecclesiam) and can therefore produce nothing but evil works 
before God, Heb. 11, 6. 

C. THE CHRISTIAN'S GROWTH IN GOOD WORKS. 

It is the will of God, clearly revealed in Holy Scripture, that 
Christian believers should perform good works in abundance, 
1 Tim. 6, 18; 2 Cor. 8, 7; 9, 8—11. Their abounding in good 
works is the inevitable effect of the abundance of divine mercies 
which they have received in Christ Jesus, 2 Cor. 8, 9. Holy 
Scripture accordingly describes true Christians as regenerated per- 



412 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


sons, who consecrate themselves entirely to the holy, grateful service 
of God in Christ Jesus, Bom. 12,1; Is. 60, 6—9. 

Luther’s comment on the last passage is apposite. He says: 
“Where there are true Christians, they give themselves and all they 
have to serve Christ and His own.” (St. L., XII, 312.) This new 
mind and disposition all believers indeed possess according to their 
new or inward man. Gal. 2, 20; Ps. 110, 3. However, since their 
flesh remains corrupt even after conversion, they are always in 
danger of abusing the doctrine of justification by grace in the 
interest of neglecting good works. This was the case already in 
the early Apostolic Church, as the numerous exhortations of 
St. Paul clearly prove. Gal. 5,13; 6, 6—10; Titus 3,14. 

When Luther restored the Gospel in its apostolic purity, he 
was obliged to publish similar admonitions (St. L., XI, 216 f.; 
X, 456 ff.), and to-day the situation in the Christian Church is very 
much the same. Instead of abounding in good works, Christians, 
impelled by their evil flesh, quite commonly are remiss in per¬ 
forming the good works which God gives them occasion to do 
(negligence in church-work, in prayer, in Christian giving, in per¬ 
sonal missionary work, etc.). 

It is for this reason that Scripture everywhere stresses not only 
the quality, but also the quantity of the Christians’ good works, 
insisting on constant growth in the grace of doing the good God 
demands of them, 2 Cor. 8, 7. 20; 9, 8.11. According to Scripture, 
believers should be “zealous of good works,” Titus 2,14; 2 Cor. 
8, 4; should not “be weary in well-doing,” Gal. 6, 9; should “do 
good unto all men as they have opportunity,” Gal. 6,10; should 
“redeem the time” in doing good works, Eph. 5, 16; should be 
“careful to maintain good works,” Titus 3, 8; etc. In short, 
Scripture multiplies its exhortations and unweariedly repeats its 
admonitions that believers should bring forth fruits of faith in 
abundance (cp., for instance, the closing chapter of St. Paul’s 
epistles). 

In addition to this, Scripture insists that Christian ministers 
should constantly urge their parishioners to “maintain good works,” 
Titus 3, 8. 14; “to do good, be rich in good works, ready to dis¬ 
tribute, willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves 
a good foundation against the time to come,” 1 Tim. 6, 17—19. 
Christian pastors are therefore Christ’s watchmen, 1 Pet. 5,1—4, 
who are in duty bound to produce, through preaching the divine 
Word, such works as please God both by their quality and quantity. 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


413 


For this purpose they are to employ the Law and the Gospel: 
the Law to point out what good works are. Matt. 22, 37—40, and 
the Gospel to make men willing to do good works, Rom. 12,1; Heb. 
13, 20. 21. 

It is indeed very necessary for Christian ministers to pay 
unceasing attention to this important function of their holy 
office. Moved by love for Christ, they must strive also in this 
matter to give their congregations a maximum of consecrated ser¬ 
vice, attending to their sacred duty of making their parishioners 
zealous of good works with unwearying zeal. While faithless 
prophets and pastors are “dumb dogs, sleeping, lying down, loving 
to slumber,” Is. 56,10, true ministers of Christ, after the example 
of their Lord and His apostles, perpetually seek to make their 
parishioners so minded in all things as God would have them be, 

1 Cor. 15,10; 1 Tim. 4,15; 2 Tim. 4, 2, and, in particular, fruit¬ 
ful in every good work, Titus 3, 8.14. 

Of this fact Luther reminds all true ministri Dei et ecclesiae 
when he writes (St. L., X, 5) : “For this reason, my dear pastors 
and ministers, note that our office has now become an altogether 
different thing than it was under the Pope; for now it has become 
serious and salutary. But just for this reason it involves much 
more toil and trouble, danger and trial, and there is in addition 
little gratitude or reward in the world. But Christ will be our 
Reward if we labor faithfully.” 

The Christian minister must therefore urge the performance 
of good works for his own sake, namely, in order that he may be 
found faithful as a good steward of Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 4,1. 2; 

2 Cor. 6, 3—10. But he must urge good works also for the sake 
of his congregation, namely, in order that they who have been en¬ 
trusted to his care may please God by many praiseworthy deeds, 
Titus 2,11—14. To accomplish this, he must urge good works, not 
feebly or timidly, but joyfully, decidedly, and forcefully, ever 
mindful of the fact that Christ Himself constantly and zealously 
admonished His hearers to be fruitful in all good works, Matt. 5, 
13—16. To this end he must also rightly distinguish between 
justification and sanctification; for it is impossible to inculcate 
true sanctification unless the right relation of justification to sanc¬ 
tification is ever kept in mind, 2 Tim. 2,15. 

It is a most serious mistake to imagine that insistence upon 
justification leads to neglect of sanctification. On the contrary, 
wherever justification is not rightly inculcated, there can be no 



414 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


true sanctification; for justification supplies not only the motive, 
but also the power for sanctification. Hence, if the Christian min¬ 
ister would move his hearers to do good works, he must constantly 
point them to the grace of God, by which the regenerate have been 
endowed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, 
Bph. 1, 3—7; Rom. 12,1; 2 Cor. 8, 9. 

Luther is right in saying (St. L., XII, 318ff.): "A preacher 
of the Law forces by means of threats and punishments; a preacher 
of grace draws and moves by means of the divine goodness and 
mercy revealed [to man]; for he wants no unwilling works nor 
any unwilling service; indeed, he wants nothing else than a glad 
and joyous service of God. He who does not permit himself to be 
moved and drawn by the sweet and lovely words of God’s mercy, 
given and granted to us so abundantly in Christ, so that he joy¬ 
fully and lovingly does all this to God’s glory and the welfare of 
the neighbor, amounts to nothing, and love’s labor is lost upon 
him. ... It is not man’s, but God’s mercy that has been given to 
us and that St. Paul would have us consider to urge and move us.” 

With respect to the tithe which God enjoined upon the Jews 
in the Old Testament, Lev. 27, 30, we must remember, on the one 
hand, that also this provision belonged to the Ceremonial Law, 
which has been abolished by Christ, Col. 2,16.17, so that it is no 
longer binding upon Christians in the New Testament; on the 
other hand, however, the abolition of the law of tithing must not 
be abused by Christians in the interest of neglecting liberal giving, 
since also in the New Testament God exhorts His saints to give 
continually and liberally, 2 Cor. 9, 6. 7. 

But while God in the New Testament desires constant and 
liberal giving just as much as He desired this in the Old Testa¬ 
ment, He accomplishes His purpose not through commands and 
threats, but through appeals to the love of His saints, which is 
rooted deeply in His own manifestation of grace and mercy in 
Christ, 2 Cor. 8, 7—10. 

To this distinction between the Old and the New Testament, 
Luther calls attention when he writes (St. L., XII, 337): “In the 
Old Testament it was commanded that [the Jews] over and above 
all the annual tithes which they had to give to the Levites had to 
contribute a special tithe every third year for the poor, the widows 
and orphans, etc. Now, such giving is neither expressly determined 
in the New Testament, nor is demanded by specific laws; for this 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


415 


is a time of grace, in which every one is admonished to do this 
willingly, as St. Paul writes, Gal. 6, 6.” 

St. Paul himself explains this difference, saying: “Even so we, 
when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the 
world; but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth 
His Son, made of a woman, made under the Law. . . . Wherefore 
thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir 
of God through Christ,” Gal. 4, 3—7. Because in Christ Jesus be¬ 
lievers are children of God, they are no longer under ceremonial 
laws, to be compelled to do God’s will by coercion; but being under 
grace, they grow by faith in the grace of willing Christian ser¬ 
vice, 2 Cor. 8, 9, loving Him because He first loved them, 1 John 
4,19; Gal. 6, 6—10. That does not mean that the Law should 
not be urged upon Christians or that neglect of Christian giving 
should not be reproved. Gal. 6, 7; but it does mean that the Chris¬ 
tian pastor, when inculcating Christian liberality, must constantly 
refer to the grace of God that has appeared in Christ Jesus, our 
Lord, in order to stimulate Christian giving, Titus 2,11—15. It 
is only at the foot of the blood-stained cross of Calvary that the 
believer learns the art of Christian giving. 

8. THE REWARD OF GOOD WORKS. 

Holy Scripture teaches very distinctly that a sinner is not 
justified by good works. Bom. 3, 23—28; 4, 4. 5; Gal. 2, 21; 
3,10; etc. Good works are therefore “not necessary for salvation.” 
But neither are good works “necessary to preserve faith,” since the 
believer is preserved in faith unto salvation by the power of God, 
Phil. 1, 6; 1 Pet. 1, 5. Hence all who do good works in order to 
earn salvation by them are under the curse; for they are fallen 
from grace, Gal. 3,10.11; 5, 4. Holy Scripture, moreover, affirms 
that good works flow from faith alone or from the triumphant 
assurance of the believer that God already has bestowed heaven on 
him as a free gift of grace for Christ’s sake, so that they are done 
freely, cheerfully, and willingly, without any coercion whatsoever, 
and without any thought of meriting even the least grace by them, 
Gal. 2, 20. In view of these facts it would seem to be out of place 
to speak of any reward of Christian good works. 

Nevertheless Scripture itself in many places most emphatically 
assures the believers that their good works shall be liberally re¬ 
warded. “Great is your reward in heaven,” Matt. 5,12; Luke 6, 
23. 35; “Every man shall receive his own reward according to his 



416 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORK8. 


own labor,” 1 Cor. 3, 8; “God is not unrighteous to forget your 
work and labor of love,” Heb. 6,10. In these and many other pas¬ 
sages Holy Scripture speaks distinctly of a reward that shall be 
bestowed upon believers on account of their good works. This 
reward is granted both in this life, 1 Tim. 4, 8, and in the life to 
come, Luke 14,14. 

How are we to understand these statements of Scripture ? Do 
they annul the doctrine of justification by grace through faith 
(sola fide)? In order to avoid any error of man’s conceited reason 
on this point, we must remember two facts: In the first place, 
though Scripture speaks of a reward of Christian good works, it 
nevertheless teaches that this reward is of grace (Gnadenlohn) and 
not of merit, Rom. 4, 4. Luther, in his exegesis of Gal. 3, 22, ex¬ 
plains this matter correctly when he says that, since the world 
does not reward believers for their good works, but rather hates 
them on account of them, Acts 5, 40; Rom. 8, 36; 1 Cor. 4,13, God 
is so kind as to attach to them special promises of gracious rewards. 
(Cf. St. L., IX, 443.) So also the Apology says (Art. Ill, 244): 
“In the preaching of rewards, grace is set forth” (“In praedicatione 
praemiorum gratia ostenditur ’ 1 ). 

So, then, we maintain on the basis of Scripture the two doc¬ 
trines: a) The believer in Christ shall receive for his good works 
an abundant reward of grace (praemium gratiae), 6 pioftog v/ucbv 
noXvs, Matt. 5,12; but b) all who demand a reward on account 
of their good works shall not only forfeit God’s reward of grace, 
but also lose their salvation, Gal. 5,4. 

These two doctrines are clearly set forth also in Matt. 19, 
27—30; 20,1—16, where Christ, on the one hand, promises to His 
believing apostles a sure reward of grace and, on the other, declares 
that, whenever the demand of a reward is made on the basis of 
merit, “the first shall be last,” Matt. 20,16, that is, the first, or the 
self-righteous, shall be entirely rejected. 

In the second place, God’s free promises of reward made to 
His saints serve the excellent purpose of prompting the indi¬ 
vidual believer zealously to perform good works, Matt. 5, 12; 
Luke 6, 23. 35. To this truth the Apology points when it says 
(Art. Ill, 78) : “By these praises of good works (Matt. 5, 10) 
believers are undoubtedly moved to do good works” (“His prae~ 
coniis bonorum operum moventur hand dubie fideles ad bene 
operandum ) 

Luther stresses this point when he remarks that in all passages 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 417 

of Scripture which speak of the reward of the believer (Gen. 15,1: 
“Thy exceeding great Reward”; Rom. 2, 6. 7, etc.) the godly are 
incited, comforted, and encouraged to continue, remain and conquer 
in doing what is good and in enduring what is evil, so that they 
may not become weary and dispirited.” (St. L., XVIII, 1810f.) 

The gracious promises of reward which Scripture offers to 
believers therefore deny the doctrine of salvation by works or 
merit and confirm that of salvation by grace. This truth the Chris¬ 
tian believer must always bear in mind, especially since both the 
papists and modern rationalistic Protestants misuse the Scriptural 
doctrine of God’s gracious reward of Christian good works in the 
interest of work-righteousness. 

Luther states the matter very clearly when he writes (St. L., 
VII, 677 ff.): “Then learn to reply correctly to those passages in 
which merit and reward are spoken of [saying] : I indeed hear 
that Christ says: ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven,’ and: ‘Blessed are ye when men persecute you 
for My sake, for great is your reward in heaven,’ etc. But by these 
words He does not teach me the foundation upon which I should 
rest my salvation; but He [by these words] gives me a promise, 
[showing me] what comfort I should have in my suffering and 
Christian life. These two things you must not mingle into each 
other nor brew together; nor must you make a merit of that which 
God gives me freely in Christ through Baptism and the Gospel. 
For He does not say here that I could earn such things or that 
I no longer need Christ or Baptism, but rather that those are 
Christ’s true disciples to whom He here preaches and who for His 
sake must suffer many things, so that they do not know how they 
may comfort themselves. Since people do not suffer them on 
earth, they should therefore in heaven all the more possess all 
things.” (Cp. also Dr. Pieper’s excellent presentation of the doc¬ 
trine, Christl. Dogmaiik, III, 64ff.) 

9. THE GREAT VALUE OF GOOD WORKS. 

Although good works have no value so far as the justification 
of a sinner is concerned, since salvation is not by works, but by 
grace, Rom. 3, 28; Eph. 2, 8. 9, it is incorrect to declare that good 
works are of no value whatsoever. To say that good works have no 
value whatever, as the Anabaptists at Luther’s time claimed, is 
both anti-Scriptural, since Scripture with great earnestness incul¬ 
cates good works, Eph. 2,10; Matt. 5,13—16, and unreasonable, 

27 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



418 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


since even conscience, on the basis of the divine Law inscribed in 
the human heart, prompts a person to do what is good, Rom. 2, 
14.15. Over against the enthusiasts, Luther (St. L., IX, 442 2.) 
emphasized the truth that outside the article of justification good 
works indeed could not be praised enough (“Extra causam iustifi- 
cationis nemo potest bona opera a Deo praecepta satis magnifies 
commendare"). 

Against the Anabaptists, Luther wrote (St. L., XIV, 310 ff.) : 
“See how nobly they teach regarding good works, saying that they 
would give away all their good works for a farthing! By this they 
want to be our apes and imitate our doctrine, having heard that 
we teach that good works do not make a sinner pious, do not blot 
out sins, and do not reconcile us to God. To this the devil adds 
his supplement and despises good works, so much so that he would 
sell them all for one farthing. ... We teach that to reconcile God, 
to make pious, to blot out sin is so high, great, and glorious a work 
that alone Christ, the Son of God, could do it and that this is 
really a pure, special, peculiar work of the one true God and His 
grace, in comparison with which our works are nothing and can 
do nothing. But that for this reason good works should amount to, 
and be worth, nothing, who ever has taught or heard such a thing 
except out of the lying mouth of the devil ? I would not give one 
of my sermons, not one of my lectures, not one of my writings, 
not one of my Lord’s Prayers, indeed, not even the least of the 
good works I have done or yet do for all the goods of the world; 
yes, I regard it [each of these good works] greater than my own 
life, which certainly is dearer to every one, and must be dearer, 
than the whole world; for each is a good work which God has done 
through and in me. But if God has done it, and if it is God’s work, 
what is the whole world compared with God and His work? And 
though I am not made pious through such works, — for that can 
be done alone through Christ’s blood and righteousness, without 
works, — nevertheless they are done to the praise and glory of God 
and to the benefit and weal of my neighbor, so that not even a single 
one of them could be paid for by the whole world or compared with 
those of the world. And this fine rabble would take only a farthing 
for them! Oh, how well Satan has hidden himself here! Who 
could not detect him here?” 

This high estimate of the value of Christian good works is 
in full agreement with the clear teaching of Scripture. Christian 
good works are indeed of great value, and this for the following 
reasons:— 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


419 


a. They are done according to the norm of Qod’s Law. While 
all works that are not done according to God’s will are worthless 
and displeasing to God, those which are accomplished according 
to His will are esteemed by Him as infinitely precious in His sight, 
Rev. 2, 2 ff. 

b. They are God’s own works in us; for He is the efficient 
Cause (causa efficiens) of all Christian good works, Phil. 2, 13; 
2 Cor. 3, 5; 1 Cor. 12, 6—11; Eph. 2,10. While all “good works” 
that are done by men to merit salvation are condemned in Scrip¬ 
ture as “works of the flesh,” Gal. 3, 2. 3.10, the good works of 
believers are praised and glorified in Holy Scripture as “fruits of 
the Spirit,” Gal. 5, 22. 23, which God Himself works in them to 
His glory, Eph. 2, 10; Col. 1, 5. 6; 1 Tim. 6, 17—19; Titus 2, 
11—14; etc. 

c. They are tokens and testimonies (testimonies Spiritus ex¬ 
terna) of the state of grace into which the believer has been placed 
through faith in Christ, Luke 7, 47; 1 John 3,14. As such they 
are of great value to the believer himself, Rev. 2,19, and to all other 
men, Matt. 5,16. 

d. They are imperishable, following the believer into eternal 
life, where they are rewarded most graciously, Rev. 14,13; Matt. 
5,12; 19,29; 10,42; Gal. 6, 9, while all earthly works will be 
consumed by fire on the Last Day, Matt. 24, 35; 1 Cor. 7, 31; 
2 Pet. 3, 10. 

e. On account of the good works of believers, of which the 
preaching of the Gospel is the foremost, God defers Judgment Day, 
Matt. 24,14; 1 Pet. 2, 9. For this reason Christians should at all 
times be most diligent in performing good works, Gal. 6,10; Eph. 
5,16; Col. 4, 5, and Christian ministers should constantly incul¬ 
cate them, Titus 3,8; 1 Tim. 6,17 ff. 

f. The performance of good works is the real objective of the 
Christian’s life on earth. As soon as a person has become a believer 
in Christ, he no longer belongs to this world, but to the kingdom 
of heaven, Phil. 3, 20; John 5,24. But God wants His saints to 
live on earth for a while in order that they may serve Christ, pub¬ 
lish His Gospel, and perform many good works to the praise of His 
name. Matt. 5,13—16. From all this it is evident that Christian 
good works (opera spiritualia) are indeed of the greatest value. 
Luther says (St. L., I, 867) : “The works which we do in our call¬ 
ing through faith in the Son of God shine before God, the holy 
angels, and the whole Church.”

THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


10. PERVERSION OF THE DOCTRINE OF GOOD WORKS. 

Since the Church of Antichrist claims to be the true promoter 
of good works (Cardinal Gibbons: “The Catholic Church is a so¬ 
ciety for the sanctification of its members”) and condemns the 
Church of the Reformation as one which, stressing unduly the 
doctrine of justification, habitually neglects sanctification, it is 
necessary to point out that the Church of Rome is not a promoter, 
but rather a perverter of the doctrine of good works. 

The charge that Luther disparaged good works was made 
already in the early stages of the Reformation (Edict of Worms, 
1521: “Luther teaches an unbound, self-willed life, which excludes 
all divine laws and is altogether bestial”). This unjust and untrue 
accusation is continued to this day despite the fact that both by 
word and deed it has been proved a malicious lie. As a matter 
of fact, just because Luther taught the true doctrine of justifica¬ 
tion, he taught also the true doctrine of sanctification, that is to 
say, he vigorously and ceaselessly insisted upon good works as 
fruits and proofs of the living faith of the true believers. 

On the other hand, the Papacy, so far as it lies in its power, 
renders the performance of Christian good works impossible because 
it anathematizes the basic article of the Christian faith, the doc¬ 
trine of justification by grace, from which all truly good works flow. 
True Christian good works are the fruits of justification by faith; 
hence wherever this doctrine is abolished and anathematized, good 
works in the sense of Christ and the Bible are out of the question. 
The Roman Catholic Church indeed insists upon works, but these 
are not “good,” but pagan works, since they are done for the pur¬ 
pose of earning salvation, Gal. 3, 10; 5, 4. Whenever Christian 
good works do occur in the Church of Antichrist, it is only because 
individual believers reject for their part the pagan doctrine of 
work-righteousness taught them by their priests and believe in the 
gracious forgiveness of their sins for Christ’s sake without the 
deeds of the Law, Rom. 3, 28. This faith puts them in a position 
where they can perform truly good works. 

We condemn the “good works” of Romanism particularly for 
two reasons. In the first place, they involve a malicious denial 
and rejection of the sufficiency of Christ’s redemptive work, being 
done to merit righteousness before God (meritum de congmo, 
meritum de condigno). But good works done for this purpose 
insult and mock God, who in His Word offers to all sinners through 
faith the entire, perfect righteousness which His beloved Son has 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


421 


secured for the world by His vicarious satisfaction (satisfactio 
vicaria). This is the clear doctrine of Scripture; for St. Paul 
writes emphatically: “If righteousness comes by the Law, then 
Christ is dead in vain,” Gal. 2, 21. The “good works” of the 
papists are therefore “under the curse,” Gal. 3,10. When Cardinal 
Gibbons (The Faith of Our Fathers, p. 35) describes the Catholic 
Church as "a society for the sanctification of its members” he 
attests officially that it is in principle an antichristian and pagan 
sect, which like all heathen cults bases salvation upon good works. 

Luther is right in saying (St. L., IX, 443): “The works 
which are done outside of faith, no matter how holy they may 
appear according to their external aspect, are sinful and under the 
curse. For this reason those who desire to earn grace, righteous¬ 
ness, and eternal life by them do not only fall short [of these 
blessings], but also heap sin upon sin. In this way the Pope, the 
man of sin and the son of perdition, does good works and all 
who follow him. In this manner also all self-righteous persons 
and heretics, who have fallen from the Christian faith, do their 
works.” 

That the entire process of sanctification in the Roman Cath¬ 
olic Church proceeds along unscriptural and antichristian lines is 
proved by the fact that this Church has perverted and condemned 
Christ’s Gospel (Council of Trent, Sees. VI, Cans. 11.12. 20) and 
persecuted its adherents (Luther was officially called “the evil foe 
in the form of a man,” “a wild, voracious boar,” “a most rapacious 
beast,” “whose memory ought to be blotted out of the communion 
of Christ’s believers”), contrary to the express exhortation of 
Christ, Luke 10,16; John 13, 20; Phil. 2, 29. The “good works” 
of the Papacy must therefore be condemned as a sanctimonious 
fraud, which Antichrist perpetrates for the purpose of deceiving 
the simple (2 Thess. 2, 9 : “lying wonders”). 

In the second place, we repudiate the good works of the Roman 
Catholic Church because they are not done according to the norm 
of the divine Law; in other words, they are not done in the sense 
that God has commanded them. On the contrary, they are the 
products of “commandments of men” and thus fall under the con¬ 
demnation of our Lord: “In vain they do worship Me, teaching for 
doctrines the commandments of men,” Matt. 15, 9. Papistic sancti¬ 
fication is not Christian sanctification at all, but only a caricature 
of that true sanctification which God demands of His children as 
the fruit of faith. 



422 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


According to Scripture the regenerate, justified by faith, serve 
God cheerfully and gratefully in every calling in which He has 
called them, either in the Church or without, Eom. 15,16; 1 Cor. 
7, 20 ff.; Col. 3, 23. 24; Eph. 6, 7; 1 Tim. 2, 15. However, the 
Church of Antichrist prescribes new norms of good works (the 
evangelical counsels, consilia evangelica, obedience, poverty, chas¬ 
tity) and in addition invents a new anti-Scriptural, antichristian 
purpose of good works, namely, that of earning salvation. 

Ordinary Catholic Christians are taught to earn salvation as 
much as lies in their power by means of the “second board” (tabula 
secunda), that is, through penance (poenitentia), which formally 
consists in doing the “good works” of contritio cordis, confessio 
oris, and satisfactio operis. The preferred class of papistic “good- 
workers” (monks, nuns, etc.), in addition to poenitentia, cultivate 
the consilia evangelica, by which they are able to earn not only 
sufficient, but even superabundant merits (opera supererogationis), 
which, upon payment of a certain price, the Pope administers to 
the “poor souls” in purgatory. (Council of Trent, Sess. VI, 
Can. 30.) The wickedness of the papistic teaching is apparent to 
every Christian believer who has tasted the sweetness of the Gospel 
and knows the Biblical doctrine of justification by faith. As 
papistic justification (by way of sanctification) is diametrically 
opposed to Biblical justification, so also papistic sanctification is 
diametrically opposed to Biblical sanctification; it is a sanctifica¬ 
tion of the flesh, or the carnal heart, not that of the Spirit, 
Gal. 3,1—3. 

The pernicious doctrine of work-righteousness as presented by 
the Roman Catholic Church culminates in the perversions of the 
Jesuits, by which manifest transgressions even cease to be sins and 
become eminently good works if they are commanded by the 
superiors of the order. 

The Index Generalis declares expressly: “The superiors may 
obligate [members] to sin by virtue of the obedience (which is 
due them), provided this will confer gTeat benefits.” (t 8uperiores 
possunt obligare ad peccatum in virtute obedientiae, quando id 
multum conveniat." (Cp. Index Generalis, Vol. II, sub Obedien¬ 
tiae et Obedire; also, Christl. Dogmatik, III, p. 80ff.) This blas¬ 
phemous disavowal of God’s Word and tyrannizing of consciences is 
but the inevitable result of the papal rejection of God’s Word as 
the only source of faith (principium cognoscendi) and its frightful 
enslaving of consciences in general as this is practised throughout 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


423 


the Church of Antichrist (cp. the demand of sacrificium, intellectus 
et voluntatis). 

The Pope demands implicit obedience of all members of his 
Church, both in articles of faith and in matters of life, so that 
every Catholic sins mortally who rests his decisions on doctrine or 
life upon his own conscience or Holy Scripture. (Cp. Council of 
Trent, Sess. IV; Luther, St. L., XIX, 341 ff.; IX, 1235ff.) 

Holy Scripture demands that every thought (nav vorjpa) be 
brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 2 Cor. 10, 5; but 
the Pope demands that every thought of his deluded followers be 
brought into captivity to the obedience of his own perverted mind. 
It was in view of these abhorrent perversions that Luther called 
the Papacy a confluxus of all heresies and affirmed that the Papacy 
at Rome was founded by the devil. 

It is true, all heretics teach ungodly doctrines; but the Pope 
not only adorns his ungodly doctrines with the name of Christ 
and the Christian Church, but also claims to be Christ’s vicar upon 
earth and as such the infallible teacher of divine truth. Just that 
is the chief characteristic of Antichrist. To be a real papist means 
to believe uugodly doctrine and to do evil works contrary to God’s 
Word, for salvation’s sake. 

As the Church of Rome, so also modem rationalistic Prot¬ 
estantism perverts the doctrine of good works. While the Church 
of Antichrist is swayed by the pernicious error of Semi-Pelagi- 
anism, rationalistic Protestantism corrupts itself by the equally 
pernicious errors of Arminianism and synergism. The result is 
the same in both cases. 

As Romanism rejects the doctrine of justification, which is the 
necessary postulate of good works, so also rationalistic Protes¬ 
tantism, in both Lutheran and Reformed circles, rejects this central 
doctrine of Scripture. Since the forensic conception of justifica¬ 
tion, as taught by Luther and the Lutheran Confessions, is regarded 
as too “juridical” and not sufficiently “ethical,” it is consigned to 
the scrap-heap of theological oblivion, and the sinner is taught to 
cooperate in his conversion and thus to rely on his good works for 
salvation. As a result also modern rationalistic Protestantism 
teaches justification by way of sanctification, or salvation by good 
works. The old Melanchthonian (Majoristic) claim that “good 
works are necessary for salvation” is thus revived as a dogma of 
the Church. Thus work-righteousness lands modern Protestantism 
in the camp of Semi-Pelagian Romanism, and both are enemies of 
the Gospel of Christ.

THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


11. SANCTIFICATION AND THE CHRISTIAN LIFE. 

We shall treat this subject under three heads: a) The Chris¬ 
tian Life and the Cross; b) The Christian Life and Prayer; and 
c) The Christian Life and the Hope of Eternal Life. 

A. THE CHB1STIAN LIFE AND THE CROSS. 

A special section on cross and tribulation in a Christian dog¬ 
matics is fully justified, since Scripture itself devotes much atten¬ 
tion to this important subject. Accordingly some of our Lutheran 
dogmaticians (Quenstedt and Calov) have embodied the subject in 
their description of the Christian life; and it is well for us to 
follow their example. 

The topic is surely worthy of careful consideration. Through 
faith in Christ the regenerate are indeed in a most blessed state. 
God is “for them,” Rom. 8, 31; they are God’s children and heirs 
of eternal life, John 1,12.13; Gal. 3, 26; Rom. 8,17; the holy 
angels minister to them, Heb. 1, 14; in God’s Word they have 
abundant comfort for every trouble in life and strength for every 
vexing question pertaining to their salvation. However, in spite 
of all this the glory which is theirs in Christ Jesus is not yet 
revealed, 1 John 3, 2. They walk in the same lowliness, humilia¬ 
tion, and suffering which characterized Christ’s own life on earth, 
1 Pet. 4,1. This life of sorrow and tribulation Scripture fitly calls 
the cross (crux) of the Christians, Matt. 10,21. 38; 16,24; Luke 
14, 27. (Cp. also Luther, St. L., XII, 729 ff.) 

1. What the Christian cross implies. Holy Scripture never 
applies the term cross to the tribulations of the ungodly, Ps. 32,10; 
34, 21; 16, 4. It is only the Christian who is said to bear a cross, 
and this indeed as he exercises his Christian calling in the world. 
Luther writes (St. L., XII, 544ff.) : “A Christian, in so far as he is 
a Christian, is subject to his dear holy cross, so that he must suffer 
either from other people or from the devil himself, who torments 
and terrifies him with tribulation, persecution, poverty, sickness, or 
inwardly in his heart by means of his poisonous darts.” Especially 
when Christians faithfully bear witness to Christ and His Gospel, 
or when they lead a holy life according to the Word of God, they 
must always expect to endure trials and bear crosses, Matt. 10, 25. 
Hence by cross we mean that suffering which Christians suffer for 
Christ’s sake, Matt. 10,16—22. 

It is true, also the regenerate are still sinners, and for this 
reason they deserve not only temporal punishments, but also eternal 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


425 


damnation, Rom. 7, 24. However, since they live in daily repen¬ 
tance and by faith receive constant forgiveness of all their sins, 
the punishments which God in His fatherly love metes out to them 
are not punishments in the strict sense of the term, since they do 
not flow from divine wrath, but rather gracious chastenings (casti- 
gationes paternae), which are designed for their temporal and 
eternal good, Rom. 8, 28; Heb. 12, 6; 1 Cor. 11, 32; Is. 26,16. 

But it is not on account of their sins that Satan and the 
wicked world trouble the regenerate. Luther says very aptly 
(St. L., XIII, 434 if.) : “The evil Foe and the world are not angry 
with Christians because they are sinners and stumble and fall now 
and then. No indeed; the devil and the world gladly tolerate this 
and even approve of it. But on account of the Word and their 
faith [they hate them], namely, because they hope in the Son of 
God, comfort themselves with His death and resurrection, fear 
God, and wish to live according to His will, earnestly desiring that 
through their confession also others may come to the knowledge of 
Christ and faith; that neither the devil nor the world can endure, 
and for this reason they constantly torment the Christians.” 

However, the Christian cross is occasioned not only by the 
devil and his servants, the children of the world; it comes also 
from the flesh of the Christians, which constantly lusts against the 
Spirit and thus always tempts and troubles them. For the Chris¬ 
tian to bear his cross therefore implies ceaseless warfare against 
the flesh, Gal. 6,12; 5,17; uninterrupted self-denial, Matt. 16, 24; 
renunciation of everything that interferes with his following of 
Christ, Luke 14, 33; repudiation of his own carnal wisdom in spir¬ 
itual matters, Matt. 11, 25. 26 ; cheerfully and willingly foregoing 
the peace and quietness of life, Matt. 10, 34; Luke 12, 51; making 
nothing of the esteem of the world. Matt. 5,11; Luke 6, 22; 1 Pet. 
4,14; relinquishing the friendship and the love of even father and 
mother, sister and brother. Matt. 10, 35—37; Luke 12, 52. 53; 
being willing to lose his earthly possessions, 1 Cor. 7, 30; Matt. 
19,21.22; indeed, hating his own life, Luke 14,26. The Chris¬ 
tian cross-bearer must therefore ceaselessly fight the good fight of 
faith against his own flesh, Gal. 5, 24; Col. 3, 5 ; Rom. 6, 6. 

2. The close connection (nexus indivulsus) between Chris¬ 
tianity and the cross. Cross-bearing is so intimately connected 
with the Christian profession that all who refuse to take upon 
themselves and bear their cross cannot be regarded as true Chris¬ 
tians, Matt. 10, 38. 39; Mark 8, 34. 35; Luke 9, 23. 24. 57—62; 



426 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


Rom. 8, 17; Luke 14, 25—35. Luther’s remarks on this matter 
are indeed pertinent. He writes (St. L., II, 467) : “He who is no 
crucianus, if I may so speak, is also no Christianus. That is to say, 
he who does not bear his cross is no Christian, for he does not con¬ 
form to Christ, his Master.” 

In spite of this it remains true that a Christian should not 
impose crosses upon himself (1 Pet. 3, 17: si ftsXoi to &sXr}[xa. 
xov dsov; 1, 6: si dsov ) or upon others, Rom. 13, 10; Matt. 22, 
37—40; for he knows neither whether the chosen cross is salutary 
nor whether God will grant him power to bear it, 1 Cor. 10, 13. 
Luther rightly called those who impose crosses upon themselves 
“work-saints” (Werkheilige) and “the devil’s own martyrs (des 
Teufels Maertyrer), by which he meant to say that, since they 
want to earn heaven by their crosses, they suffer at the instigation 
of the devil (St. L., IX, 1130). 

3. How Christians should regard their crosses. Because cross¬ 
bearing is a most painful burden to the flesh of the regenerate, they 
often labor under the false impression that God is dealing unjustly 
and cruelly with them in making them suffer as He does, indeed, 
that He has forgotten them or has even become their enemy, 
Lam. 5, 20; Ps. 13, 1; Job 30, 21; Is. 49, 14. For this reason 
some “in time of temptation” lose their faith and fall away from 
God, Luke 8,13. Scripture therefore is very explicit in explaining 
the true nature and purpose of Christian cross-bearing, Heb. 12, 
6—11; 1 Cor. 11, 32. Christian cross-bearing is a testimony of 
the Holy Spirit (testimonium Spiritus Sancti externum) that God’s 
saints do not belong to the condemned world, but to Christ and 
that they are joint heirs with Him, if they faithfully suffer with 
Him, Rom. 8, 16. 17; 1 Pet. 4, 14; Matt. 5, 11. 12. Their cross 
therefore always points to the glory which shall be revealed in 
them, Rom. 8,18; 2 Thess. 1, 5—7; 2 Cor. 4, 7. 8. It is the char¬ 
acteristic (Luther: Hoffarbe) of Christ’s pilgrims who are on 
their way to heaven (Luther, St. L., XII, 718ff.), and for this 
reason they should truly rejoice in their sufferings for Christ’s 
sake, Matt. 5,12; Luke 6, 23, knowing that, as they suffered with 
Him, they shall also be glorified with Him, 1 Pet. 4,13; 3,14.15. 
Thus the apostles at Jerusalem rejoiced in their persecutions, Acts 
5,41, and above all St. Paul thus rejoiced in his sufferings, Acts 
16, 25; Rom. 5, 3. 

In their cross-bearing Christians may rejoice all the more, 
since they know that God has not only accommodated their cross 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


427 


to their ability to bear, but also actually aids them in bearing it, 

1 Cor. 10,13; 2 Cor. 12, 9. Hence the cross of the individual 
Christian is never too heavy for him; it is apportioned in mercy 
and proportioned to his measure of faith, 2 Cor. 4,17. 

4. The benefits of Christian cross-bearing . Everything that 
God assigns to His believing saints on earth is of eternal value, 
Rom. 8, 28. So also the cross which believers bear is of incalculable 
benefit to them. It points them to heaven, Acts 14, 22; renders 
them humble before God, 2 Cor. 12, 7; teaches them implicit trust 
in divine grace, 2 Cor. 12, 8. 9; strengthens their faith, 1 Pet. 
1, 6. 7; moves them to prayer, Ps. 18, 6; Is. 26,16; crucifies their 
old man and destroys the body of sin, Rom. 6, 6; 1 Pet. 4,1; and 
turns their view from this present, perishable world to the eternal, 
imperishable life to come, 2 Cor. 4,18. By their patient and faith¬ 
ful cross-bearing believers also encourage others to be steadfast 
in their trials and to continue in the hope of the glorious promises 
of the living God, 2 Cor. 1, 6; 1 Thess. 1, 6. 7. The lesson of 
Christ’s glorious cross is best taught by him who has victoriously 
borne his own cross, 2 Cor. 1, 4; 12, 10. (Cp. Luther, St. L., 
IX, 1131.) 

5. The strength to bear the cross. Even the truest and best 
believer cannot bear the cross laid upon him by his own power, 

2 Cor. 12, 7—9. Patient cross-bearing therefore always presupposes 
and necessitates divine grace, 2 Tim. 1, 8; 2 Cor. 4, 7. In par¬ 
ticular, the Christian cross-bearer receives strength to bear his 
cross from the gracious assurance of the forgiveness of all his sins, 
Rom. 5,1—5; from his sure hope of eternal life, Rom. 8,18; from 
his new, spiritual life with Christ in God, Col. 3, 3. 4; from God’s 
glorious promises of a gracious reward in heaven, Matt. 5,12; in 
short, from his abiding, sanctifying faith in the divine-human 
Christ, who loved him and gave Himself for him, Gal. 2, 20. 

Luther rightly remarks that a person who is not sure of eternal 
life and does not look for that blessed hope (Titus 2,13) can be 
neither submissive nor patient (St. L., IX, 956), while Christians, 
whose conversation is in heaven, have power to rejoice even in 
their greatest tribulations. 

Of St. Paul Luther writes (St. L., XII, 717 ff.): "Behold how 
he [St. Paul] turns his back upon the world and looks forward to 
the coming revelation, just as though he saw no trouble or misery 
whatever upon earth, but only joy. Indeed, if we should suffer 
ever so much, what does all our suffering amount to, he says, when 



428 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


we compare it with the unspeakable joy and glory which shall be 
revealed in us ? . . . Thus St. Paul regards all the suffering of this 
earth as a little drop and a small spark, but of the glory which we 
are looking for he makes an infinite ocean and a great fire. And 
in calling it a ‘glory that shall be revealed in us,’ he indicates 
why it is that we suffer so unwillingly, namely, because our faith 
is yet weak, so that we do not look to the glory, still hidden in 
this life, which shall be revealed in us. For if it were a glory 
that we could see with our eyes, then indeed we should be fine, 
patient martyrs.” 

Luther closes this fine paragraph with the pertinent remark 
that because of the blindness of our miserable, weak flesh we cannot 
comprehend the great, surpassing goodness and grace to which 
God calls us by laying upon us our Christian crosses, “the Holy 
Spirit must be our Teacher in this matter and put such comfort 
into our hearts.” To this every true Christian cross-bearer agrees. 
Unless the Holy Spirit grants us grace to bear our cross, we shall 
never possess enough power to bear it, not even the lightest. 

6. Christian cross-bearing and the Christian's sin. In con¬ 
nection with this subject the question has been raised whether also 
the sin which still cleaves to the Christian believer may be con¬ 
sidered a part of the cross which he must endure. This query must 
be answered in the affirmative; for whenever the believer sins, he 
does something that he abominates, Eom. 7,15. A true Christian 
earnestly deplores the fact that he is so “sold under sin,” Eom. 
7, 14, that he constantly commits the sins that he does not wish 
to do, Eom. 7,15, and so he fervently beseeches God to deliver him 
from “the body of this death,” Eom. 7, 24. For this reason our 
dogmaticians rightly say that also the evil flesh, which is sold under 
sin, Eom. 7,17—19, belongs to the cross which believers must bear 
in this life. (Cp. Luther, St. L., XII, 727. 728. 735.) 

B. THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND PRAYER. 

1. The intimate connection (nexus indivulsus) between the 
Christian life and prayer. As long as a person remains in his 
natural state of sin and wrath, he fears and therefore also flees 
God, Heb. 2,15; Gen. 3, 8. But as soon as he by faith has entered 
into the new, spiritual life, he begins to commune with God, 
Eom. 8,15. This spiritual communion of the believer with God 
we call prayer. 

Christian prayer has rightly been defined as “the communion 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


429 


of a believing heart with God,” Ps. 27,8. While words of the 
mouth are not absolutely necessary to make a “communion with 
God” a prayer, Is. 65, 24; Horn. 8,26. 27, yet they must not be 
regarded as superfluous, Acts 7, 59; 16, 25. 

Since Christian prayer is the fruit of the believer’s faith in 
the gracious forgiveness of his sins for Christ’s sake, it is con¬ 
tinuous, 1 Thess. 5,17, because the regenerated heart, led and moved 
by the Holy Spirit, is habitually turned toward God and there¬ 
fore also in ceaseless communion with Him, Horn. 8,14.15. 

Hence a Christian prays even when he is not aware of it, as 
when he is occupied with his work or when in great tribulation he 
considers himself incapable of praying. (Cp. Luther, St. L., 
IX, 922.) As the natural pulse beats ceaselessly as long as there 
is life in a body, so the pulse of prayer is beating constantly as 
long as a person has spiritual life. 

Luther rightly (St. L., VIII, 363) says: “Wherever there is 
a Christian, there is also the Holy Spirit, who does nothing else 
than pray ceaselessly. For although he [the Christian] does not 
always move his mouth or utter words, nevertheless his heart always 
moves and beats, just as his pulse and his natural heart, with such 
ceaseless sighings as: Dear Father, Thy name be hallowed, Thy 
kingdom come, Thy will be done among us and all men, etc. . . . 
Hence you cannot find a single Christian who does not always 
pray, just as little as you can find a living person without a pulse, 
which never stands still, but always beats, though the person may 
sleep or do something else, so that he does not take notice of it.” 

The simple division of prayer into supplication and thanks¬ 
giving is adequate, since also the intercessions that are to be made 
for governments and for all men (1 Tim. 2,1—3; Jer. 29, 7), for 
believers (Eph. 6, 18), and for unbelievers and enemies (Matt. 
5,44; Luke 23,34; Acts 7,59) come under the head of supplica¬ 
tions. (Cp. Luther, St. L., X, 2204.) 

2. What Christian prayer presupposes. Christian prayer pre¬ 
supposes much more than the “absolute feeling of dependence upon 
God” (Schleiermacher) or “faith in the general providence of 
God” (Ritschl). Even the heathen perceive that they are depen¬ 
dent upon a Supreme Being, and to some extent they, too, have 
faith in a divine providence, Acts 17, 23. 26—28; yet St. Paul 
affirms that what they sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to 
God, 1 Cor. 10, 20. 

As a matter of fact, when a Christian prays, a most intimate 



430 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


communion takes place between a creature who is dust and ashes, 
Gen. 18, 27, and, what is more, a sinner and by nature an enemy 
of God, Rom. 8, 7; 5, 8, and the sovereign, majestic Creator, 
Ps. 5,1—7. In order that a sinner, blind, dead, and unworthy as 
he is by nature, may rightly commune with God as a dear child 
communes with its loving father, he must be regenerated, or born 
again, John 3, 5. 6. 

Christian prayer therefore always presupposes true faith in 
Christ, or faith in the gracious forgiveness of all sins for Christ’s 
sake. Holy Scripture describes as true prayers only those which 
are offered in the name of Christ, John 16, 23; 14, 13. 14. 
If a prayer is to be a true prayer, it must flow from faith in 
Christ, John 6, 29; 14, 6. No other prayer can be addressed to 
God with true confidence, Rom. 5,1—5, which is a basic character¬ 
istic of Christian prayer, Jas. 1, 6. 7; Rom. 14,23. Luther is in¬ 
deed right when he says (St. L., VIII, 362; IX, 922 ff.) that no 
one can offer a prayer outside the name of Jesus (such as are the 
prayers of the Turks, Jews, monks, and hypocrites), while, if 
a prayer is offered in Jesus’ name, even one letter is valid and 
pleasing to God. 

True, also the heathen and all those in the visible Church 
who reject Christ’s vicarious atonement pray with a certain earnest¬ 
ness and devotion; but such religious emotions flow from the flesh 
and not from true faith. Their author (causa efficiens) is not the 
Holy Ghost, who always glorifies Christ in those in whom He 
operates, John 16,14, but the devil, who “worketh in the children 
of disobedience,” Eph. 2, 2. Ritschl condemned his own ration¬ 
alism (denial of Christ’s vicarious atonement) when he said: “The 
prayer to God as our Father in Christ Jesus distinguishes the 
Christian religion from all others.” 

The truth of this statement is borne out by the study of com¬ 
parative religion. Christianity alone teaches its followers to pray 
to the Father in heaven in the name of His divine Son, who by 
His vicarious death secured reconciliation for all sinners. All re¬ 
ligions which have their origin in the depraved flesh of man incul¬ 
cate prayer on the ground of the sinner’s own righteousness, or 
good works. Hence all who do not pray in the name of Jesus 
know neither to whom to pray nor how rightly to pray; their 
prayers are vain repetitions, spoken without faith and confidence, 
and are never heard, Matt. 6, 7. This is true both of the prayers 
of the heathen (prayer-mills of the Buddhists) and of the apostate

Christians (the rosaries of the Romanists). It is only the true 
believer who prays in the name of Christ, that is, with perfect 
trust in the divine grace for the sake of Christ, Dan. 9,16—19, and 
without any confidence in his own merit or worthiness. 

All prayers of unchristian and anti-Christian lodges, which 
deny the Holy Trinity and Christ’s deity and vicarious atonement, 
are pagan and idolatrous and as such an abomination in the sight 
of God. For a Christian to hold membership in such lodges means 
to deny the divine Savior and His vicarious atonement and to give 
great offense to professing Christians. A Christian can therefore 
not hold membership in a lodge without endangering his soul’s 
salvation. 

Luther writes (St. L., VIII, 361 ff.): ‘Wherever there is the 
Spirit of grace, there He brings it to pass that we can and dare, 
aye, indeed, that we must begin, to pray. . .. For before we become 
Christians and believe, we do not know what and how we should 
pray. Although a person prays ever so earnestly [viewed ex¬ 
ternally], yet [before conversion] the Spirit of grace is not 
there. . . . There is [then] no faith in divine grace and mercy 
for Christ’s sake, and the heart always remains uncertain, so that 
it must ever doubt whether it is heard; it deals with God only 
on the ground of its own holiness or that of others, without Christ, 
as if God should humble Himself before it and be prevailed upon 
to bestow His grace or help for our sake and thus become our 
servant or debtor. To do this means not to merit grace, but wrath; 
it is not a prayer, but rather a mockery of God.” 

3. What Christian prayer works and bestows. Since God pre¬ 
serves the world only for the sake of His saints, more especially, 
in order that they may preach the Gospel for a witness unto all 
nations, Matt. 24,14, and since all true Christians pray in perfect 
agreement with God’s good and gracious will, which sustains and 
governs all things, 1 John 5, 14, we may say that their prayers 
sustain and govern (instrumentaliter) the whole universe. That 
is the clear doctrine of Scripture, which assures us that all things 
occurring in the Kingdom of Power and in the Kingdom of Grace 
are mediated through Christian prayer. 

In particular, because of Christian prayer “the Word of the 
Lord has free course,” 2 Thess. 3,1; through it God opens to His 
servants “a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ,” Col. 
4, 2—4; Eph. 6,19. 20; through it all ministers of the Word are 
“delivered from them that do not believe,” Rom. 15, 30—32; 



482 


THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


through it the peace of the world is preserved, Jer. 29, 7; as a re¬ 
sult of it Christians lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness 
and honesty, 1 Tim. 2,1—3; through it the godly are preserved 
from the wicked, Ps. 55, 24; 2 Pet. 2, 7, etc. Whatever Christ 
works as the causa efficiens He works through His Christians as 
through instrumental causes (causae instrumentaXes), as He Him¬ 
self testifies, Acts 1, 8; 1 Cor. 3, 9. 

Luther writes on this point (St. L., VIII, 350 ff.): <c We must 
not separate the Head from its members, that is, Christ from His 
apostles and all Christians. Every single Christian is such a one 
as the Lord Jesus Christ Himself was while He was upon earth, 
and he accomplishes such great things that he can rule the world 
in divine things, help and profit every one, and do the greatest 
works that are done upon earth. For he is regarded higher by 
God than the whole world, so that for his sake God gives and sus¬ 
tains to the world all things that it has; indeed, if no Christians 
would be upon earth, no city and no country would have peace; 
then surely on a single day all things that are upon earth would 
be destroyed by the devil. That grain grows in the field and the 
people prosper, enjoy food, peace, and protection, for all this they 
must thank us Christians. For while it is true that we are poor 
beggars, as St. Paul writes 2 Cor. 6,10, we are nevertheless such as 
make many rich; as possessing nothing and yet possessing all 
things. In short, it is true, what kings, princes, lords, citizens, and 
peasants have in the world they have not because of their golden 
hair, but because of Christ and His disciples. Therefore the 
Christians are truly helpers and saviors, yes, lords and gods of the 
world, as also God said to Moses, Ex. 7,1: ‘I have made thee a god 
to Pharaoh/ ” 

4. What Christian prayer asks for. Since Christians, when 
praying in the name of Jesus, pray according to God’s will, their 
prayers include all things which God Himself wills and has prom¬ 
ised to give them. It is for this reason that Christ has said: "All 
things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall re¬ 
ceive,” Matt. 21, 22; Mark 12, 24; John 14,13.14; 16, 23; Matt. 
7, 7. 8. The words "all things whatsoever” must not be limited, but 
taken in their full force, since the will of the believer always 
coincides with the good and gracious will of God. 

It is true, in so far as believers are still flesh, they often do not 
will what God wills; but because they are new creatures in Christ, 
the will of the flesh is suppressed, and their prayers are offered up 



THE DOCTRINE OP SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 483 

to God according to the rule of Christ: “Not My will, but Thine, 
be done.” As Christians acknowledge the Word of God as the 
only source and rule of their faith, so they also acknowledge solely 
the will of God as the norm of their petitions, 1 John 5,14. 

From this follows the general rule that, whenever believers 
pray for temporal blessings, they pray conditionally. Matt. 26, 39; 
but if they pray for spiritual blessings, they pray unconditionally, 
since God has promised to grant them His grace, forgiveness of 
sins, life, and salvation under all circumstances, 2 Cor. 12, 9. 

Unconditional prayers for earthly blessings belong in the 
domain of heroic faith (fides heroica). But the heroic prayer 
should not be attempted unless the believer is fully assured that he 
has heroic faith (cp. Luther's supplication for the restoration of 
Melanchthon’s health). 

Of all prayers the Lord’s Prayer is the best, since it was given 
to us by our Lord Jesus Christ and embraces all spiritual and 
bodily needs of the believer. Luther says: “There is no nobler 
prayer on earth than the Lord’s Prayer; for it has the glorious 
promise that God gladly hears it; and we should not exchange all 
the blessings of this earth for it.” 

The prayers to the departed saints are foolish, Is. 63, 16; 
1 Kings 8,39; Acts 10,25.26; idolatrous, Matt. 4,10; and blas¬ 
phemous; indeed, an insult to God’s perfect grace secured by the 
merits of Christ, 1 Tim. 2, 5. 6; 1 John 2,1. 2; Bom. 8, 31. 32. 34. 

While no prayers should be offered to angels, Bev. 19, 10; 
22, 8. 9, Christ as the Son of Man, or Christ according to His 
human nature, should be given divine worship because of the unio 
personalis. Matt. 16,16.17. 

Extemporaneous prayers may be abused as much as prayers 
that are read from prayer-books; if the latter are exposed to the 
danger of mechanical recital, the former are liable to that of vain 
repetition, as experience proves. Whenever a Christian prays, he 
should bear in mind that he is in the presence of the holy, sovereign 
God, Dan. 9,18. 

With respect to the forms and ceremonies to be observed when 
a Christian prays, we may quote Luther’s directions as in full 
accord with God’s Word. Luther writes (St. L., VIII, 748): “It 
does not matter whether we stand, kneel, or lie prostrate; for all 
these, being external matters, are unnecessary since they are neither 
commanded nor forbidden, as also others, for instance, lifting up 
the head and eyes to heaven, folding the hands, and smiting upon 

28

one’s breast. Yet they should not be despised, since Scripture, yes, 
Christ Himself, praises them, Eph. 3,14; 1 Tim. 2, 8; John 17,1. 
So also it is not wrong if, for instance, one who is binding sheaves 
in a field or who is lying in bed should pray only with the heart.” 

C. THE CHRISTIAN LITE AND THE HOPE OP ETERNAL LIFE. 

The Christian life is lived in constant joyous expectation of 
Christ’s second and final Advent, Titus 2,13. (Cp. Luther’s great 
sermon on this passage; St. L., IX, 930ff.) As the believers in the 
Old Testament always waited for Christ’s gracious coming in the 
flesh, Luke 1,67—79; 2, 29—32, so the believers in the New Testa¬ 
ment await with true joy and patience His glorious coming to 
judge the quick and the dead, Luke 21, 28. 

This cheerful, hopeful expectation of the day of Judgment is 
a characteristic of the true Christian, 1 Cor. 1, 7; Titus 2, 13; 
Phil. 3, 20. According to Scripture, Christians, on the one hand, 
“call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ” (LuxaXov/ievoi cfr 
to ovofjLa xvgiov *Irjoov Xgimov), Acts 9, 14. 21; 1 Cor. 1, 2; 
2 Tim. 2, 22, and, on the other, they “wait for the revelation of our 
Lord Jesus Christ” (djiexdeyoperoi Ttjv djtoxaXvtpiv tov xvgiov 
’Irjoov Xgioxov), 1 Cor. 1, 7. 

The precious hope of their perfect final salvation through the 
glorious return of their Lord motivates their entire Christian life. 
It makes them diligent in the performance of good works, Matt. 
24, 45 ff.; 25,14ff.; Luke 12,15 ff.; ardent in the preaching of the 
Gospel, Matt. 24, 14; cautious and circumspect in their earthly 
life, Titus 2, 12—14; watchful against carnal security, Matt. 
24, 36ff.; satisfied with their pilgrimage on earth, 1 Pet. 2, 11; 
Heb. 13, 14; careful in the use of earthly things, 1 Cor. 7, 31; 
kind toward all men, Phil. 4, 5; ready at all times to receive the 
Lord at His coming. Matt. 25, Iff.; unmindful of the tribulations 
of their brief earthly life, Rom. 8, 18; joyful in cross-bearing, 
Rom. 8,18; Luke 6, 23; Matt. 5,12; 1 Pet. 2,12.13; and trium¬ 
phant in death, 1 Thess. 4,13—18. 

In short, the inspiring hope of their Lord’s glorious advent 
constantly moves them to walk worthy of their high calling in 
Christ, Eph. 4, Iff.; Col. 1, lOff.; 1 Cor. 16, 22; 1 Pet. 4, 7 ; Jas. 
5, 8; Phil. 4, 5. Christians should lead godly lives also in view of 
death, Phil. 1, 21—23; Ps. 90, 12; but above all the Christian 
life is oriented to the last advent of Christ with its glorious eternal 
salvation (sub specie aeternitatis ). 



THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS. 


485 


It is true, also in hoping, waiting, and living for the glorious 
return of their Lord, believers are not perfect; therefore they must 
strive after perfection from day to day. Luther very fittingly calls 
it a “Christian art and true masterpiece” for a believer “to turn 
his back upon the world, which is made to pass away, and to keep 
his view persistently on the future life, which remains eternally 
and into which he properly belongs.” 

He writes: “This is rightly taught, but not easily learned; 
this is truly proclaimed, but not easily believed; this is correctly 
impressed upon the heart, but not easily followed; this is well 
said, but not easily done. ... It is a part of our weakness [of the 
flesh] that we always fear death, mourn, and doubt if things 
turn out badly. This is a proof that we do not await the blessed 
hope as we should.” 

Again: “If the heart does not direct and prepare itself for 
that imperishable life, but cleaves to this temporal, perishable life, 
it does not understand what Baptism, the Gospel, Christ, and faith 
really mean. We have not been baptized unto this life; we are 
not called Christians because we are citizens, peasants, lords, ser¬ 
vants, maids, rulers, or ruled, laborers, and housekeepers, but we 
are baptized unto this, and for this purpose we hear the Gospel 
and believe in Christ, that we may set aside all these vocations . . . 
and turn from this world to another existence and life, where there 
is neither lord nor servant, maid nor mistress, woman nor man, 
but where we are altogether equal and one in Christ Jesus, Gal. 
3, 28, which equality begins in this life through faith, but is made 
perfect in vision in the life to come. . . . Unto this eternal life 
we are baptized, unto this Christ has purchased us by His death 
and blood, and for this purpose we have received the Gospel.” 



436 


THE DOCTRINE OF PRESERVATION. 


THE DOCTRINE OF PRESERVATION. 

(De Perseverantia.) 

One of the most important questions relating to the Christian 
life is that concerning the believer’s preservation in faith to 
the end. (Cp. Luther, St. L., IX, 1807.) Our Savior Himself 
urges us to consider this question when He reminds us of the great 
truth that only “he that endureth to the end shall be saved,” Matt. 
10, 22 ; 24, 13. The emphasis in these passages rests upon the verb 
endure, so that Christ’s words are a most earnest exhortation ad¬ 
dressed to His followers to endure to the end. 

This earnest admonition implies that many do not endure in 
faith, and that again suggests the weighty query, How can the 
believer endure in faith unto the end? In answer to this question 
Holy Scripture stresses two vital facts: 1) All who endure in 
faith to the end do so alone by divine grace; or we may say, Chris¬ 
tian preservation is solely the work of God’s omnipotent grace. 
2) All who fall from faith do so through their own fault; in other 
words, the only cause of apostasy is man’s wilful rejection of God’s 
Word and his malicious opposition to the operation of the Holy 
Spirit in the divine Word. These truths must be maintained and 
defended against both Calvinism and synergism. 

a. Against Calvinism. Calvinism teaches persistently that it 
is impossible for those who have once been endowed with faith 
to lose it again, even if they should commit enormous crimes 
(peccata enormia). Its claim is that, while the exercise of faith 
(exercitium fidei) may cease, faith itself never ceases. Calvin: 
Tenendum est, quantwmvis exigua sit ac debilis in electis fides, 
quia tamen Spiritus Dei cert a illis arrha est ac sigillum suae adop- 
tionis, nunquam ex eorum cordibus deleri posse eius scvlpturam. 
(Inst., II, 2, 12.) 

The doctrine of the inamissibility of faith is taught by the 
Calvinists to remove the uncertainty which the individual Reformed 
believer must feel with respect to his state of grace in view of the 
fact that he dare not believe in universal grace (gratia universalis). 

Luther, on the other hand, who affirmed the gratia universalis, 
taught also the Scriptural doctrine of the amissibility of faith, 
1 Cor. 10, 12; Luke 8, 13; Is. 1, 2. ■ The Augsburg Confession 
(Art. XII) teaches: “They condemn the Anabaptists, who deny 
that those once justified can lose the Holy Ghost.” Those who 
were troubled about their state of grace, Luther comforted with 



THE DOCTRINE OF PRESERVATION. 


487 


the gracious promises of God in Christ Jesus, revealed and offered 
in the Gospel to all sinners, Titus 2,11, and not with any “past 
or present experience of Christ’s presence and indwelling in the 
heart,” as the Calvinists do. 

Luther’s method alone is Scriptural; for not only does the 
Gospel truly comfort all alarmed sinners, but it is also the divine 
means by which those who have fallen from grace may be restored 
to faith in Christ, Rom. 10,17. 

It goes without saying that all who deny the gratia universalis 
are unable to console despairing sinners with the gracious Gospel 
promises. Since they teach particular grace (gratia particularis), 
it is impossible for them to assure the individual sinner that God’s 
grace is seriously meant for him. By a fortunate inconsistency the 
practise of Calvinistic preachers is often better than is their theory. 

b. Against synergism. As the Calvinistic doctrine of final 
perseverance is unscriptural, so also is that of the synergists. While 
the Calvinists deny the gratia universalis, the synergists deny the 
sola gratia. Hence they are compelled to prompt the sinner to 
rely for salvation, in part at least, on his own worthiness. The 
statement that “good works are necessary to preserve faith,” which 
the Formula of Concord so vigorously rejects, is a real expression 
of synergistic cooperation. It is synergistic doctrine that, as the 
sinner must do his share to become a believer, so he also must do 
his part to persevere in faith. In the final analysis therefore 
synergism teaches, in common with Calvinism, that the Christian 
assurance of the believer depends on something in his own heart, 
be it the experience of Christ’s indwelling (Calvinism) or his good 
conduct, or works (synergism). Both Calvinism and synergism 
therefore ascribe to man the ability to persevere in faith unto 
the end. 

In contradistinction to this error Holy Scripture affirms that 
the believer owes his perseverance alone to the grace and power 
of God. In other words, divine monergism is responsible also for 
the believer’s preservation unto salvation, Phil. 1,6; 1 Pet. 1,5; 
John 10, 28—30. Scripture thus takes the salvation of the believer 
out of his own weak and helpless hands and places it into the 
almighty, faithful hand of God, 1 These. 5,24; 2 Thess. 3, 3. 

Even while Scripture exhorts Christian believers to work out 
their salvation with fear and trembling, it assures them at the 
same time that it is God which “worketh in them both to will and 
to do of His good pleasure,” Phil. 2,12.13. Hence this passage 



438 


THE DOCTRINE OF PRESERVATION. 


cannot be employed in the interest of synergism, since the last 
clause absolutely excludes every synergistic claim. 

The connection between the two verses is quite clear. In the 
first, the apostle addresses the secure and indifferent, who neglect 
sanctification; in the second, he reproves the pharisaic spirits, 
who through their deceitful self-trust make salvation depend on 
their own power to sanctify themselves. In fact, this self-trust, 
or self-righteousness, is the real cause why temporary believers lose 
their faith. In this way Peter fell from faith. His defection 
occurred because he believed himself capable of greater faith and 
constancy than his fellow-disciples, Mark 14, 29; and even the 
earnest admonition of the Lord did not shatter his self-confidence, 
Mark 14, 30. Peter thus fell through his own sinful self-confidence, 
and had it not been for divine grace, he never would have regained 
faith, Luke 22, 32; John 21,15—17. Synergism, which expressly 
teaches such self-confidence, is therefore a most pernicious error; 
it is a doctrine which, consistently followed, must occasion, or lead 
to, apostasy. Against synergism Luther, in his defense of divine 
monergism, rightly said that perseverance depends not upon the 
will of man, but upon the sustaining grace of God (Perseverantia 
est non volentis hominis , sed sustentantis Dei). 

As Calvinism cannot comfort a believer with real assurance 
of salvation, so also synergism fails to supply the believer with 
an adequate foundation on which he may rest his hope of everlast¬ 
ing life with certainty. Its consolation is only the sinking sand 
of the believer’s own worthiness. But woe to the person who trusts 
in that, 1 Cor. 4, 4! In fact, he who trusts in his own works for 
salvation has fallen from grace. Gal. 5, 4, and is under the curse of 
God, Gal. 3,10. On the other hand, the Scriptural truth that we 
are kept by God’s power through faith unto salvation, 1 Pet. 1, 5, 
affords the believer abiding comfort even in the severest trials; 
for he knows that in the hands of almighty God his salvation is 
absolutely secure. The doctrine of the sola gratia not only pro¬ 
duces, but also strengthens and preserves, true Christian faith. 

Some synergistic theologians have claimed that divine grace 
and power indeed preserve the believer’s faith against all external 
foes, but not against his own flesh (Meyer, Philippi). But this 
claim is void of Scriptural foundation. When Christ assured His 
disciples that “no one shall pluck them out of His hands,” John 
10, 28. 29, this promise certainly included the foe within as much 
as that without. So also the other promises of Scripture regarding 



THE DOCTRINE OF PRESERVATION. 


489 


perseverance are universal in their scope, Phil. 1, 6; 1 Pet. 1, 3—5; 
5,10; 2 Thess. 3, 3. Hence the Christian believer should be as¬ 
sured that, as God did not omit anything to prepare salvation for 
him, so also He omits nothing by which this salvation is finaliter 
attained. In other words, divine grace relates not only to justifica¬ 
tion and sanctification, but also to the perseverance of the believer 
unto eternal salvation. 

Doubts regarding salvation arise only when men intermingle 
Law and Gospel, that is to say, when they apply the Scripture- 
passages that are meant as a warning against carnal security, 
1 Cor. 10,12; Eom. 11,20, to penitent sinners, who in the anguish 
of their hearts cry out for the comfort of the Gospel, Rom. 7,24, or 
when they urge despairing souls to assure themselves of salvation 
by their good works. Penitent sinners who long for comfort should 
listen to no other message than that of God’s justifying, sanctify¬ 
ing, and preserving grace, Matt. 11,28; Is. 55,1—3. 

The warnings set forth in Holy Scripture against defection, 
1 Cor. 10,12; Rom. 11,20. 21; Heb. 3,12, etc., enforced by ex¬ 
amples of temporary believers (Saul, Demas) do not militate 
against the blessed assurance of the Gospel that God will graciously 
keep the believer in faith to the end, Phil. 1, 6, but rather sustain it. 
These warnings belong to the Law and must not be misused to 
nullify the Gospel promises. St. Paul, though aware of the possi¬ 
bility of his becoming a castaway, 1 Cor. 9, 27, was nevertheless 
fully persuaded of his perseverance, Rom. 8, 38. 39; 2 Tim. 4, 7. 
God warns us against defection through the Law in order that we 
may beware of carnal security, which destroys the certainty of sal¬ 
vation, and cling to the Gospel, which bestows and nourishes the 
assurance of salvation. 

The precious Gospel truth concerning the certainty of the be¬ 
liever’s salvation does not engender spiritual pride, but fosters true 
humility and suppresses the carnal security of the flesh. Also with 
the growth of the believer’s certainty of salvation his gratitude 
toward God and his zeal in good works increase, and these are 
divine blessings which both despair and carnal security destroy. 

Since it has pleased God to bestow His grace upon men by 
the means of grace, it is self-evident that the believer will per¬ 
severe in faith only if he faithfully uses the divine means of grace 
(the Word and the Sacraments). Christians who desire to remain 
steadfast in their faith and sure of their salvation must therefore 
continually dwell in the sanctuary of sanctuaries, the divine Word, 



440 


THE DOCTRINE OF PRESERVATION. 


where God offers and imparts to them constant grace and strength 
for abiding with Christ in true faith, Rom. 1,16; 10,17; John 8, 
31. 32. 51. To the diligent and conscientious use of the Word of 
God must be joined also ceaseless, ardent prayer, John 16,23.24; 
Matt. 26,41; Eph. 6,17.18; 1 Thess. 5,17, since God has prom¬ 
ised to bestow His blessings only upon those who continue in 
prayer, Luke 11,13; Jas. 1, 5. 6; 4, 2. 

With respect to the question (crux theologorum), “Why do not 
all believers persevere in faith” (Cur alii, alii non)? the Christian 
theologian has no other answer than that given in Hos. 13, 9. 
Those who persevere in faith do so alone by divine grace; those 
who fall from faith must blame themselves for their apostasy 
(unbelief; self-righteousness; malicious neglect or rejection of 
the means of grace). If a comparison is instituted between two 
individual persons, such as Saul and David, Judas and Peter, the 
Christian theologian at this point humbly acknowledges a mystery 
which he is incapable of explaining, since Scripture itself does not 
answer the perplexing question why Saul perished in unbelief and 
David repented or why Judas died in despair and Peter was rescued 
from perdition. 

The advice of the Formula of Concord with regard to this 
matter is Scriptural and sound (Thor. Decl., XI, 57—63): “As 
regards these things in this disputation which would soar too high 
and beyond these limits, we should with Paul place the finger upon 
our lips and remember and say, Rom. 9,20: ‘0 man, who art 
thou that repliest against God V ”

THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 

(De Medlls Qratiae.) 


1. DEFINITION OF THE TERM. 

In order to offer and convey to men the merits which Christ 
has secured for the world by His death on the cross, 2 Cor. 5, 21; 
Rom. 6, 18, God employs certain external, visible means through 
which the Holy Spirit works and preserves faith and thus accom¬ 
plishes the sinner’s salvation. 

That is the clear teaching of our Confessions. The Formula 
of Concord thus writes (XI, 76): “The Father will not do this 
[draw any one to Himself] without means, but has ordained for 
this purpose His Word and Sacraments as ordinary means and 
instruments.” The Smalcald Articles (Part II, Art. VIII, 3) : 
“In those things which concern the spoken, outward Word we must 
firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no one except 
through or with the preceding outward Word.” The Augsburg 
Confession (Art. V, 2): “They [our churches] condemn the Ana¬ 
baptists and others who think that the Holy Ghost comes to men 
without the external Word, through their own preparations and 
works.” 

Our dogmaticians define the means of grace as " media externa 
a Deo ordinata, quibus Deus gratiam a Christo acquisitam homi- 
nibus offert et fidem ad gratiam accipiendam necessariam in homi- 
nibus efficit et conservat.” As divinely ordained means of grace 
they acknowledge, on the basis of Scripture, only the Word (the 
Gospel) and the Sacraments, Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, the 
latter two as the visible Word (Verbum visibile). 

According to Scripture these divinely ordained means have 
a twofold function or power, namely, a) an exhibiting, offering, 
or conferring power (vis exhibitiva, dativa, collativa) and b) an 
effective, or operative, power (vis effectiva sive operativa). The 
first consists in this, that the Holy Spirit through the means of 
grace earnestly offers to those who hear or read the Word the grace 
of God (Dei favor) and the righteousness of Christ (meritum 
Christi); the second, that He through the means of grace actually 
works, strengthens, and preserves in the hearts of men a living 
faith in the gracious forgiveness of their sins, so that they are 
converted, justified, sanctified, and finally glorified. For this

reason we rightly call the means of grace media communicationis 
remissionis peccatorum sive iustificationis ex parte Dei. 

This doctrine of the means of grace the conceited reason of 
man has corrupted in a twofold manner. On the one hand, it has 
declared that means of grace are unnecessary for salvation (Zwing- 
lianism: The Holy Spirit requires no wagon [vehiculum] for His 
divine operations); and, on the other, it has added to the two 
Sacraments ordained by Christ additional sacraments (Romanism: 
penance, confirmation, marriage, the ordination of priests, extreme 
unction). In the final analysis every perversion of the doctrine 
of the means of grace is made in the interest of the doctrine of 
work-righteousness. 

2. THE MEANS OF GRACE IN GENERAL. 

The doctrine of the means of grace is understood properly 
only when it is considered in the light of Christ’s redemptive work 
(satisfactio vicaria) and the objective justification, or reconcilia¬ 
tion, 2 Cor. 5, 19. 20, which He secured by His substitutionary 
obedience (satisfactio vicaria). If these two doctrines are cor¬ 
rupted (Calvinism: denial of gratia universalis; synergism: 
denial of sola gratia), then also the Scripture doctrine of the 
means of grace will become perverted. Calvinism thus regards the 
means of grace as unnecessary; synergistic rationalism (Armini- 
anism), as mere incentives for virtuous efforts to obtain salvation. 
Hence, if the doctrine of the means of grace is to remain intact, 
the entire doctrine of the vicarious redemption of Christ must be 
taught in its Scriptural truth and purity. This becomes evident 
as we study the doctrine of the means of grace in detail. 

According to Holy Scripture the preeminent means of grace 
is the Word of Reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5,19, or the Gospel of Christ, 
Rom. 1,16. The divine Law, or the immutable will of God, though 
in itself it is the inspired Word of God no less than the Gospel, 
nevertheless is not a means of grace, since it offers to the sinner 
only wrath and condemnation, Gal. 3,10, not grace and the forgive¬ 
ness of sins. In contradistinction to the Gospel, which is properly 
“the ministration of righteousness,” 2 Cor. 3, 9, the Law is the 
“ministration of condemnation” (ibid.). For this reason the divine 
Law is rightly excluded from the means of grace. 

The Gospel is a means of grace, not only inasmuch as it offers 
grace to the sinner, but also because it actually absolves him from 
all sins. Luther very correctly says: “The Gospel is a general 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


443 


absolution; for it is a promise which, according to God’s will and 
■command, all in general and every one in particular should accept.” 
(St. L., XXIb, 1849.) 

Moreover, the Gospel is a true means of grace in every form 
in which it is presented to the sinner, no matter whether it is 
preached publicly (Mark 16,15.16; Luke 24,47), or whether it 
is read (John 20, 31; 1 John 1, 3. 4); whether it is directly pro¬ 
nounced as an absolution, either in public or in private (John 
HO, 23; 2 Cor. 2,10: “To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive 
also”) or expressed by a symbol (John 3, 14. 15; crucifix), or 
whether it is considered in the heart (Luke 2, 51; Korn. 10, 8), etc. 
In short, no matter how the Gospel is brought before the minds 
of men, it is always a true means of grace, offering to them, 
and conferring upon them, the grace of God through faith in 
Christ Jesus. 

Some modern theologians have argued that the Gospel is 
offective only when it is proclaimed or preached (the Dorpat school; 
Volck, etc.); but the passage on which they base their contention 
(Korn. 10, 17) does not support their claim, since the words “by 
hearing” (<•!£ dxoijg) do not exclude other modes of receiving the 
■divine Word, John 20, 31; 1 John 1, 4. The Word of God is 
always efficacions when it is applied, because it is spirit and life, 
John 6, 63. Our old dogmaticians rightly say that the Word is 
supernaturally endowed with efficacy, that is to say, it has an active, 
supernatural, and truly divine force or power of producing super¬ 
natural effects, t. e., of converting, regenerating, and renewing the 
minds of men. ( Doctr . Theol., p. 501.) 

This supernatural power, which must not be compared with 
the natural force which inheres in every human word and especially 
in every eloquent human discourse, is always inherent in the divine 
Word, because the Holy Spirit is indissolubly connected with it, 
so that we must never regard the divine Word as being without 
divine efficacy or as being in itself a “lifeless instrument” which 
the Holy Spirit employs efficaciously only under certain conditions, 
whenever it pleases Him. 

On the contrary, wherever the divine Word is, there also is 
the divine Spirit; and whenever a person uses the Word of God 
in any form, God is divinely operative in it, 1 Cor. 2, 4. God’s 
operation upon a person who reads the written Word is therefore 
not an “operation from a distance” (actio in distantia), but an 
operation which is directly mediated through the divine Word 



444 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


(Rom. 10,17: mans dxorjs). Christ Himself commands us not 
only to hear the Gospel, but also to “search the Scriptures,” John 
5, 39. 46, thus asserting efficacy of the Word also when it is 
being read. 

With regard to the efficacy of the divine Word and the power 
of the Holy Spirit, who works through the Word, Quenstedt writes 
(1,183): “The Holy Ghost does not by Himself do something and 
the Word of God by itself something else, hut they produce the 
one effect by one and the same action.” That is Scripture doctrine, 
Rom. 1,16; 1 Cor. 2,4. 

Since God has connected His most gracious promise of for¬ 
giveness with Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, these also are true 
and efficacious means of grace, namely, by virtue of the divine 
promises that are attached to them. 

Of Baptism, Scripture teaches expressly that it is “for the 
remission of sins,” els fi<peoiv afiagucov, Acts 2, 38, and “for the 
washing away of sins,” dnokovaai apagnas, Acts 22, 16; Eph. 
5,26; 1 Cor. 6,11. 

In the Lord’s Supper Christ offers to the communicant the 
body and blood shed for the remission of sins, Luke 22, 19. 20; 
Matt. 26, 26—28, so that also in this Sacrament we have God’s 
gracious offer of pardon for the sake of Him who died and shed 
His blood as a ransom for sinners. 

Since the sacred actions of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, 
to which the divine promises are attached, can be perceived by 
the eye, they are called the “visible Word” (Verbum visitile), or 
“Sacraments.” 

The Apology explains this expression correctly when it says 
(Art. XIII [VII], 5): “These rites have God’s command and the 
promise of grace, which is peculiar to the New Testament. For 
when we are baptized, when we eat the Lord’s body, when we are 
absolved, our hearts must be firmly assured that God truly forgives 
us for Christ’s sake. . . . But just as the Word enters the ear 
in order to strike our heart, so the rite itself strikes the eye in 
order to move the heart. The effect of the Word and of the rite 
is the same, as it has been well said by Augustine that a Sacrament 
is a visible word, because the rite is perceived by the eyes and is, 
as it were, a picture of the Word, signifying the same thing as 
the Word.” 

In order that we may rightly understand the doctrine of the 
Sacraments, we must bear in mind that all means of grace have 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


445 


the same purpose and effect; that is to say, on the one hand, they 
offer to men God’s gracious forgiveness of sins (vis collativa); 
on the other, they engender and strengthen faith (vis effectiva). 

The divine pardon proclaimed in the Gospel is therefore the 
same as that ofEered and conveyed by Baptism or the Lord’s Supper, 
so that we do not obtain one-third of God’s forgiveness through 
the Gospel, another third through Baptism, and a last third 
through Holy Communion. Scripture expressly describes the 
whole forgiveness of sins which God purposes to give to sinners 
for Christ’s sake as mediated through the Gospel, Rom. 1,16, or 
through Baptism, Acts 2, 38; 22,16, or, again, through the Lord’s 
Supper, Matt. 26, 28. 

In short, by whatever means God offers grace to men, He 
always offers His entire grace and not merely a part of it, so that 
every means of grace instituted by God conveys to the believer 
His full forgiveness with life and salvation. The Augsburg Con¬ 
fession (Art. V) says: “For through the Word and Sacraments, as 
through instruments, the Holy Ghost is given, who works faith 
when and where it pleases God.” For this reason it is unscrip- 
tural to attribute to the various means of grace specific functions 
in an exclusive sense, as, for example, to Baptism the working of 
regeneration, to Holy Communion the implanting of the resur¬ 
rection body, and even physical benefits. 

It is true. Holy Scripture indeed ascribes to Baptism the 
power of regeneration, for it calls this Sacrament “a washing of 
regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost,” Titus 3, 5; but it 
ascribes the same regeneration also to the Gospel, 1 Pet. 1, 23: 
“Being born again by the Word of God,” and no less to Holy 
Communion, Matt. 26, 28: “This is My blood, shed for the remis¬ 
sion of sins,” since it is the gracious assurance of the forgiveness 
of sins that works regeneration. The Augsburg Confession 
(Art. XIII) therefore teaches that “the Sacraments were ordained 
to be signs and testimonies to awaken and confirm faith in those 
who use them,” the same as the Gospel itself. (Cp. Apology, 
Art. XIII [VII], 3—5. 

All who deny that the Sacraments offer to the sinner the same 
grace and pardon that are proffered to him in the Gospel pervert 
the Scriptural doctrine of the means of grace and, in particular, 
that of the Sacraments. Those who ascribe to the Sacraments 
a lesser or partial grace do so in the Calvinistic interest of reducing 
the value of the Sacraments (“Sacraments are mere signs or memo- 



446 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


rials”), while those who ascribe to them “a physical operation” do- 
this in the interest of the Romanistic error of an operation with¬ 
out faith, or ex opere operato, sine bono motu utentis. 

According to the Calvinistic conception the means of grace are 
not necessary for salvation; according to the papistic view tho 
Sacraments require no receiving means ( medium Xymixov) on the 
part of the sinner, since grace is infused by mere physical contact 
with the Sacrament. Both errors equally corrupt the comforting 
doctrine of Scripture regarding the divine way of applying to the 
sinner the forgiveness of sins which Christ has secured for him 
by His perfect obedience. Calvinism substitutes for the Scriptural 
way (through means, by faith) the man-made way of faith without 
means (faith through immediate divine operation), while Ro- 
manism substitutes the man-made way of means without faith 
(operation by physical contact, ex opere operato). 

In both cases God’s application of forgiveness to the sinner 
(through the means of grace, by faith) is obstructed by man-made 
impediments; for in the first instance God’s conferring means 
(media douxa) are removed, and in the second, faith, or man’s 
receiving means ( medium Xrjnuxov), is taken away, so that in 
neither case God’s forgiveness is received by the sinner. 

If, despite their errors, Reformed and papistic believers do 
receive forgiveness of sins, it is only because they, by the grace of 
God, correct their unscriptural theory by a Scriptural practise. 
In other words, the Reformed believer, in spite of the false Calvin¬ 
istic teaching, faithfully clings to, and uses, the means of grace, 
while the papistic believer, in spite of the pernicious ex-opere- 
operato doctrine, confides in the gracious promises which are con¬ 
veyed to him in the means of grace. (Cp. Apology, Art. XIII 
[VII], 18—23.) 

When we consider the relation of faith to the means of grace, 
we must bear in mind that faith is not an essential part of the 
means of grace, nor does their efficacy depend on faith. The blessed 
promise of the means of grace always stands, and their power 
remains unimpaired, despite the unbelief of man. Yet the means 
of grace and faith are correlatives. The Apology says (Art. XIII 
[VII], 20) : “The promise is useless unless it is received by faith.” 
This truth we must hold against the Reformed. (Cp. Hodge: “The 
efficacy of the Sacraments is not due to their inherent virtue, but 
is conditioned on the presence of faith in the recipient.” Syst. 
Theol.j III, 501.) Hodge should have said: “The Sacraments do 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


447 


not profit without faith, since faith is the receiving means of their 
promises and blessings.” 

If the question is put, “Why did God ordain so many means 
of grace when one suffices to confer upon the sinner His grace and 
forgiveness?” we quote the reply of Luther who writes (Smalccdd 
Articles, IV): “The Gospel not merely in one way gives us counsel 
and aid against sin; for God is superabundantly rich in His grace. 
First through the spoken Word, by which the forgiveness of sins 
is preached in the whole world, which is the peculiar office of the 
Gospel. Secondly through Baptism. Thirdly through the holy 
Sacrament of the Altar. Fourthly through the power of the keys 
and also through the mutual conversation and consolation of 
brethren. Matt. 18, 20.” 

The Scriptural explanation that “God is superabundantly rich 
in His grace” should induce us gratefully to consider and use all 
the means of grace with equal esteem and keep us from perverting 
the doctrine of the means of grace by setting one against the other 
or by denying the necessity of any or all of them. Also in the 
corruption of the doctrine of the means of grace the conceited 
reason of man reveals its ingrained blindness and perversity. 

With respect to the number of the Sacraments there can be 
no controversy among theologians as long as they adhere to Scrip¬ 
ture as the only rule of faith. If by the term sacrament we mean 
a sacred act in which the divine command and promise are attached 
to visible signs, or elements, prescribed by God Himself, there are 
only two Sacraments, namely, Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. 
To these two sacred acts the term sacrament ought to be confined, 
since otherwise confusion is bound to follow. 

The additional “sacraments” of the Roman and Eastern Cath¬ 
olic churches (confirmation, penance, ordination of priests, mar¬ 
riage, extreme unction) are not commanded in Scripture; in their 
perverted forms (Catholic penance, for example, is not Scriptural 
repentance) they are “commandments of men,” Matt. 15, 9, and 
therefore “vain worship.” Marriage, which likewise is a “Catholic 
sacrament,” is indeed instituted by God, but to it is attached 
only the promise of propagation, Gen. 1, 28, not that of forgiveness 
of sins. 

In conclusion, we may say that, since the term sacrament is 
a vox dygacpog, or only an ecclesiastical term (vox ecclesiastica), 
it must not be taken amiss if orthodox teachers who adhere to the 
principle of Scripture (principium cognoscendi) occasionally em- 



448 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


ploy the expression in a wider sense, as, for example, the Apology 
does (Art. XIII [VII], 4ff.) : “Therefore Baptism, the Lord’s 
Supper, and Absolution, which is the Sacrament of Repentance, are 
truly Sacraments.” 

In this wider use the term sacrament comprises all “rites which 
have the command of God and to which the promise of grace has 
been added.” {Ibid., 3.) In other words, the visible, divinely pre¬ 
scribed earthly elements (water, bread, and wine) are in that case 
not regarded as essential parts of a sacrament. Since absolution has 
both a divine command and a promise, it may be called a sacrament 
in a wider sense. 

However, to avoid confusion, our dogmaticians discourage the 
use of the term sacrament in this case, and they consistently speak 
only of two Sacraments, namely, Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. 
So also our Confessions speak whenever they employ the term in 
its strict, or real, meaning. 

3. ERRONEOUS DOCTRINES REGARDING THE MEANS 

OF GRACE. 

The Scriptural doctrine of the means of grace has been grossly 
perverted by Romanists, Calvinists, and synergistic (Arminian- 
istic) rationalists. On account of the importance of the matter we 
shall consider their outstanding errors in detail. 

a. The error of Romanism. Romanism indeed teaches that 
Christ by His death has secured grace for sinners. Hence it 
emphatically rejects the doctrine that a sinner may be justified and 
saved “without divine grace through Christ” (Council of Trent, 
Sess. VI, Cans. 1. 2. 3.10. 22). According to papistic doctrine this 
divine grace, secured by Christ, is designed for all men, so that 
the Council of Trent repudiates without reserve the particular grace 
(gratia particularis) of Calvinism (Sess. VI, Can. 17). 

In view of these facts the Roman Catholic Church ought to 
espouse the Lutheran doctrine of justification by grace through 
faith in Christ’s vicarious atonement; yet Rome has expressly 
anathematized this cardinal doctrine of the Christian Church. 

To understand this attitude, we must remember what Roman 
Catholic theologians understand by the terms “divine grace,” “justi- 
fying grace,” etc. According to papistic doctrine, Christ died for 
the sins of the world in order that God can infuse into the sinner 
(with his own constant cooperation) so much grace (gratia infusa) 
that he is enabled truly to merit justification and salvation 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


449 


(Council of Trent, Sess. VI, Cans. 4. 32) either de contfruo (by 
desiring, or striving after, the good) or de condigno (by actually 
accomplishing meritorious works). In other words, according to 
Roman Catholic doctrine, Christ has secured for sinners so much 
grace that they by divine gracious assistance (infusion of divine 
powers) can earn salvation themselves. 

From this it follows that according to Roman Catholic doc¬ 
trine the media gratiae are not divinely appointed means by which 
God offers and conveys to the sinner by faith the entire obedience 
of Christ, but rather means by which the sinner through infused 
grace is put into a position to earn salvation by his own efEorts. 
The entire doctrine of the means of grace is thus perverted in the 
interest of work-righteousness. 

However, since reliance on works always leaves a sinner un¬ 
certain with regard to his state of grace and salvation (and such 
uncertainty Rome declares to be a particular Christian virtue; 
Council of Trent, Sess. VI, Cap. 9, Can. 13), the number of 
"sacraments” has been multiplied (confirmation, penance, ordina¬ 
tion, marriage, extreme unction), so that the sinner through 
many "sacraments” may receive the maximum of gratia infusa 
and so multiply works for salvation (Council of Trent, Sess. VII, 
Cans. 3. 4). 

Especially the "sacrament of penance” is designed for the pro¬ 
duction of good works on a large scale (crusades, pilgrimages, 
indulgences, monkery, etc.). In fact, there is no limit to the 
good works which a Catholic may do by diligently using the 
"sacrament of penance.” Yet despite all these works he may never 
be sure of salvation, in consequence of which his Christian life 
remains a perpetual striving after salvation by means of good 
works. Even the Sacraments cannot give him comfort in his 
trouble of sin; for though they are said to "infuse grace,” and this 
ex opere operato, sine bono motu utentis (of themselves, without 
any good intention on the part of the recipient), they do not im¬ 
part forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation. The Romanistic doc¬ 
trine of the Sacraments is therefore a radical perversion of the 
Scriptural doctrine of the means of grace. 

b. The error of Calvinism. Since Calvinism denies the gratia 
universalis and insists that the grace of God in Christ Jesus is 
particular (gratia particularis), that is, designed for, and confined 
to, a limited number of men (the elect), it is obliged to teach 
that there are no real means of grace for the non-elect. On the 

29 


CHRISTIAN DOCMATICS. 



450 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


contrary, for all those whom God has predestinated to eternal con¬ 
demnation the means of grace become “means of damnation,” as 
Calvin asserts. “Est universalis vocatio, qua per externam Verbi 
praedicationem omnes pariter ad se invitat Devs, etiam qvibus 
earn in mortis odorem et gravioris condemnationis materiam pro- 
ponit.” (Inst., Ill, 24, 8.) 

It is true, Calvin ascribes the damnation of the non-elect also 
to their own rejection of divine grace, which is offered to them in 
the “universal call” of God through the preaching of the external 
Word; but this is one of the many inconsistencies of Calvinistic 
soteriology. In reality, according to the Calvinistic view, there 
is no divine grace for the non-elect, and hence there is no occasion 
for them to despise or reject it. He writes: “Only the elect expe¬ 
rience the inward power of the Spirit and receive, in addition to 
the outward signs, also the res or virtvs sacramenti.” (Inst., Ill, 
24,15; Consens. Tigur., c. 16.) 

In short, according to Calvin there is no saving grace for the 
non-elect, even though at times he charges the reprobi and impii 
with rejection of divine grace. In Calvin’s case this mode of speech 
is only a meaningless repetition of the language of orthodox Chris¬ 
tianity, which rightly speaks of a rejection of divine grace on the 
part of the improbi and impii, since on the basis of Scripture it 
teaches that divine grace is universal and the divine call to salva¬ 
tion therefore serious. Grace can be rejected by men only in case 
it is seriously offered to all (vocatio seria), as our dogmaticians 
have always pointed out. 

However, in the final analysis, Calvinism acknowledges no 
means of grace even for the elect. Calvin distinctly advises the 
believer not to judge his election and salvation according to the 
universal Gospel call (vocatio universalis), which is extended 
through the external Word (per externam praedicationem), but 
only according to the special call (vocatio specialis), which con¬ 
sists in inward illumination by the Holy Ghost. From the strict 
Calvinistic point of view this direction is quite consistent, since 
even true believers dare not build their hope of salvation on the 
call and promise of the Word; for this is extended also to the 
non-elect as “a savor of death unto death” and might therefore 
deceive them. Consequently the Reformed pii and electi have no 
other way of judging their election and salvation than that of 
the inward illumination of the Holy Ghost (interior Spiritus 
illuminatio), or of infused grace. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


451 


However, even this inward illumination of the believer occurs, 
according to the Calvinistic view, not through the preaching of 
the Gospel, but immediately. (“In the working of regeneration 
all second causes are excluded.” — “The infusion of a new life into 
the soul is the immediate work of the Spirit.” — “The truth [the 
Gospel] attends the work of regeneration, but is not the means by 
which it is effected.” Hodge, Syst. Theol., II, 684sq.) 

From this it follows that Calvinism can recognize no means 
of grace by which God offers and seals salvation to men and en¬ 
genders faith or works regeneration. In other words, Calvinism 
must reject the means of grace as “second causes,” or means by 
which regeneration is effected. Its denial of the gratia universalis 
consistently destroys the Scriptural doctrine of the means of grace, 
leaving no signs and testimonies whatever (signa et testimonia) of 
God’s gracious will toward the sinner by which faith is created or 
strengthened. 

It is true, Calvinism speaks of the Word and the Sacraments 
also as “signs,” “symbols,” etc., of divine grace (signa, symbola, 
tesserae, sigilla ; Conf. Helv., II, c. 19; Conf. Belgica, Art. 33). 
But as long as it holds that divine grace is particular and that 
the same signs may be “signs of salvation” and “signs of con¬ 
demnation,” the believer must forever remain in doubt regarding 
his state of grace, since he cannot determine whether the signum 
or sigillum in his case means salvation or damnation. Hence he 
is obliged to put his hope for salvation in the interior illuminatio, 
or in the inward illumination of his heart; and that, after all, 
is nothing else than the gratia infusa. 

However, the case is still more serious. The Calvinistic denial 
of universal grace and of the Scriptural doctrine of the means of 
grace destroys also the Scriptural doctrine of saving faith and 
saving grace. A faith that does not rely solely on the gracious 
promises of the Gospel is not true faith in the sense of Scripture, 
but only a mere fancy (Einbildung). According to the express 
teaching of the Bible saving faith is engendered through the preach¬ 
ing of the Gospel and consists essentially in reliance upon the 
Gospel promises, Bom. 10, 17; Mark 1, 15; 16, 15. 16. Every 
other kind of trust is confidence in a man-made foundation and 
therefore a fictitious faith. 

But right here Calvinism and Komanism meet to disavow 
the Scripture doctrine of saving faith. Bomanism, on account of 
its rejection of the sola gratia, is forced to trust in infused grace 



452 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


(gratia infusa, i. e., sanctification, good works) for salvation; 
Calvinism, on account of its rejection of the gratia universalis, is 
likewise compelled to trust in sanctification for assurance of sal¬ 
vation (interior illuminatio). Romanism makes the mistake of 
claiming that divine grace is infused into the sinner ex opere ope- 
rato, or without faith on the part of man; Calvinism makes the 
equally great mistake of teaching that the Holy Spirit works regen¬ 
eration or faith immediately, or without the means of grace. The 
departure from Scripture in either case is evident and, consistently 
maintained, makes saving faith impossible, since it assigns to it 
a false foundation, sc. gratia Dei in nobis, or the sanctified heart. 

However, saving faith and saving grace are correlatives, and 
he who perverts the one is bound to pervert also the other. As 
Romanism and Calvinism pervert the doctrine of saving faith by 
resting faith upon a good quality in man, so they also pervert the 
doctrine of saving grace (gratia salvifica). Both regard saving 
grace not as God’s gracious disposition toward the sinner for 
Christ’s sake (Dei favor gratuitus), but rather as God’s gracious 
sanctifying operation in the heart, known in the one case as 
gratia infusa (Romanism) and in the other as interior illuminatio 
(Calvinism). 

This is true despite the fact that many Reformed theologians 
expressly state that the object of the sinner’s trust is the Dei favor 
gratuitus. What they teach in theory they retract in practise, 
especially whenever they are obliged to comfort a sinner who is 
alarmed about his state of grace. Since they deny universal grace 
and the objective reconciliation of the whole world through the 
death of Christ, they must point the sinner who is looking for 
assurance of salvation to divine grace as this is active in his heart, 
or to “the present experience of Christ’s presence and indwelling, 
corroborated by active service and purity of life” (Strong). For 
additional assurance they point, moreover, to the supposed fact 
that the Holy Ghost, once granted to the believer, can never be lost. 
But both these doctrines are man-made, and so the assurance of 
salvation derived from them is likewise man-made and therefore 
nugatory and vain. 

c. The error of synergism. What has been'said of Roman- 
istic Semi-Pelagianism may be said also of synergism (Armini- 
anism). Romanism denies the sola gratia; synergism does the 
same. Both ascribe salvation in part to the virtuous efforts of 
man to apply himself to, or to decide for, grace. And though 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


453 


neither synergism nor Arminianism regards the means of grace 
as working ex opere operato, yet they both consider them, not 
simply as God’s conferring means (media donxa), by which He 
graciously offers salvation and engenders and strengthens faith, 
but rather as incentives by which the sinner is induced to convert 
himself through the divine powers communicated to him. 

But here again it must be said that a faith which does not 
trust exclusively in the grace of God for Christ’s sake is not true 
faith in the sense of Scripture, Gal. 5,4; 3,10, but the very oppo¬ 
site of faith, namely, wilful repudiation of the Gospel, Horn. 4, 4. 5. 
In its final result therefore also synergism perverts the doctrine of 
the means of grace and renders saving faith impossible. 

d. It is almost superfluous to mention the fact that all errorists 
who deny the vicarious satisfaction of Christ (satisfactio vicaria) 
cannot teach the Scriptural doctrine of the means of grace. Since 
they refuse to accept the reconciliation secured by Christ’s substi¬ 
tutionary death, they are obliged to reconcile God by “trying to 
keep the commandments of God,” and this leaves no room for 
any divine means of grace as media remissions peccatorum sive 
iustificationis , Eph. 1, 7; Gal. 5, 4. Modernism is paganism, 
veiled by, and decked with, Christian terminology, which destroys 
the very heart of the Christian religion, namely, justification by 
grace through faith in the atoning blood of Christ, Horn. 3,23—28. 

e. What is true of Modernism is true to a great extent also 
of enthusiasm, or the belief that the Holy Spirit works outside of, 
and apart from, the divinely ordained means of grace (extra illud 
enthusiasticum ). 

This error presents itself in many different forms. One form 
is that of Zwinglianism: “The Holy Spirit requires no wagon 
(vehiculum) to enter, and work in, the hearts of men; hence faith 
is not the fruit of the Gospel, but of the immediately working 
Spirit” (immediate operantis Spiritus). Quakerism is another and 
more extreme form of enthusiasm: “God gives His Spirit without 
the means of His Word, so that even those may be saved who have 
never heard of the historic Christ.” But the error of enthusiasm 
is advocated also by those modern theologians who teach that faith 
may be awakened through “the person of Christ” or His “histor¬ 
ical manifestation” ("die geschichtliche Erscheinung”), apart from 
the Gospel-message of His vicarious death. Saving faith certainly 
trusts in the historic Christ, but the historic Christ is the Christ 
of the gospels, who shed His blood on the cross for the sins of the

world, 1 John 1,7; Gal. 3,13; 2,20. And this Christ, the only 
Savior of sinners, whose merits are earnestly offered to all men in 
the means of grace, modern rationalistic theology rejects. 

That modern experimentalism (experience-theology; Erlebnis- 
theologie) is enthusiasm pure and simple requires no further proof. 
A faith that is not engendered by the Holy Ghost through the 
means of grace is not true faith, but self-delusion, 1 Tim. 6, 3. 4. 
The different forms of enthusiasm (Muenzer, Zwingli, Hodge, the 
Pietists, modern experimentalists) differ not in kind, but only in 
degree. When modern experimentalists say: “The Christian lives 
not by the means of grace, but through the personal fellowship with 
God which he experiences in Christ” (A. Harnack); or: “The 
man who is inwardly overcome by the power of the person of Jesus 
experiences in this same inner transaction God’s forgiveness of his 
sins” (W. Hermann), they prove by these clear statements that 
they reject the means of grace just as all other enthusiasts reject 
them. Faith is indeed an experience; but it is the Gospel that 
must produce this faith, or this experience, John 8, 31. 32; 17, 20. 
Whenever men look for the grace of God outside the Gospel, they 
overthrow the very foundation of faith. 

Among the arguments by which enthusiasts of all types have 
attempted to justify their disavowal of the means of grace, we 
may note the following: — 

a. The means of grace are superfluous, since the Holy Spirit 
requires no means (Zwingli: dux vel vehiculum) to enter and 
work in man’s heart. Answer: Holy Scripture clearly teaches that 
the Holy Spirit will ordinarily not deal with men without means, 
John 17,20; Rom. 10,17; Eph. 2, 20; etc. 

b. Since regeneration is the work of God’s almighty power, 
it cannot be effected through means. Answer: Holy Scripture 
teaches that regeneration is the work of God’s almighty power 
working through means, Eph. 1,19; Rom. 10,17; Titus 3, 5. For 
this reason Hodge should not write: “If the Gospel and the Sacra¬ 
ments save, it is no longer God who saves.” ( Syst . Theol., II, 
683. 685. Cp. the following reductio ad absurdum: “If bread 
sustains life, it is no longer God who sustains life.”) 

c. It is an unworthy conception of God to regard Him as 
bound to means when dealing with men. Answer: Since it has 
pleased God to employ means both in the realm of nature and that 
of grace, it is unbecoming to us to judge Him. 

d. If God actually operated through means of grace, then all 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


455 


to whom the means are applied would have to be saved. Answer: 
This argument does not hold since grace, operating through means, 
can be resisted, Matt. 23, 37; Acts 7, 51. 

e. The means of grace are superfluous since saving faith rests 
on Christ. Answer: We admit that saving faith rests on Christ; 
but unless faith rests on the means of grace, it does not rest on 
Christ, John 8,31.32; 17,20; 1 Tim. 6, 3ff. 

f. Many rely upon the fact that they are baptized and thus 
sink into carnal security. Answer: In spite of this fact Scrip¬ 
ture teaches the efficacy of Baptism, Acts 2, 38; 1 Pet. 3, 21. 

g. Holy Scripture teaches that we are saved alone by faith in 
Christ; therefore Baptism does not regenerate. (Cp. Hodge, Syst. 
Theol., Ill, 1600.) Answer: Scripture teaches both: Faith saves, 
and Baptism saves. The two statements do not exclude, but in¬ 
clude each other. 

h. The passage John 3,8 is opposed to the doctrine of the 
means of grace. Answer: This passage describes the mysterious 
character of the work of the Holy Spirit, but it does not say that 
the Holy Spirit works without means; cp. v. 5; John 6, 45; Eph. 
3, 6; 1 Pet. 1, 23; John 17, 20. 

Enthusiasts thus pit their rationalist conceptions of what is 
possible and proper for God to do against the clear Scripture- 
passages which assert that God has appointed and uses the means 
of grace for the powerful operation of His grace. Is. 55,11; Jer. 
23, 29; Acts 2, 38; 20, 32; Korn. 10,17; 1 Pet. 1, 23; 3, 21, etc. 
(Cp. Dr. Engelder, Dogmatical Notes.) 

The Scriptural doctrine of the means of grace is of such 
weighty importance that all Christians have reason to examine 
themselves whether on this point “they are in the faith,” 
2 Cor. 13, 5. If Christians neglect the means of grace (the hear¬ 
ing of the Word and the use of the Sacraments), they are in danger 
of falling from faith and losing their salvation, John 8, 43—47. 
All Christians, too, are constantly threatened by self-righteousness, 
since the opinio legis by nature inheres in their flesh, Gal. 3,1—3. 
Also with respect to the doctrine of the means of grace Christ’s 
earnest admonition “Watch and pray that ye enter not into temp¬ 
tation,” Matt. 26, 41, must be constantly heeded. 

In the Lutheran Church the Pietists directed the alarmed 
sinner not to the Word and the Sacraments, but to their own prayers 
and wrestlings with God in order that he might win his way into 
a state of grace. They also instructed the believer to base his as- 



456 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


surance of grace not on the objective promise of the Gospel, but 
on the right quality of his contrition and faith and on his feeling 
of grace. In both cases they taught Reformed (enthusiastic) 
doctrine. Moreover, because they based salvation on what is really 
a gratia inftisa, they championed papistic doctrine. (Cp. Luther, 
St. L., XI, 453 ff.; XIX, 943 ff.) 

As we warn our hearers against the subjectivism of the sects, 
which makes the validity of the divine pardon offered in the means 
of grace and their efficacy dependent on the hearer’s subjective 
attitude, we must strenuously uphold the objective nature of sal¬ 
vation, that is to say, the objectivity and reality of the vicarious 
atonement, as not being conditioned on any act of man and the 
objective nature of the means of grace as offering forgiveness of 
sins outright to men and exercising their power in every case where 
they are applied. What Dr. Walther writes on this point deserves 
our constant, diligent attention. He says: “The characteristic 
feature of our dear Evangelical Lutheran Church is her objectivity, 
which means that all her doctrines by their very nature keep man 
from seeking salvation in himself, in his own powers, aspiration, 
performance, and condition and lead him to seek his salvation 
outside of himself, while the characteristic feature of all other 
churches is their subjectivity, they all leading man to ground his 
salvation upon himself.” (Cp. Lehre und Wehre, 36, 19.) By 
nature all men are enthusiasts, and it is only through the diligent 
use of the means of grace that the believer obtains strength to 
overcome the temptation to renounce the means of grace. (Cp. Lu¬ 
ther, St. L., XI, 455ff.; also Dr. Engelder, Dogmatical Notes.) 

In this connection we must warn our hearers also against the 
error of making faith its own object; that is to say, believers must 
never base their faith upon their faith. Faith must be based alone 
on the Gospel, never on anything within man (aliquid in nobis), 
Luther writes very aptly: “Es ist gar viel ein ander Ding den 
Glauben haben und sich auf den Glauben verlassen.” We are 
certainly required to believe, but only because by faith the promise 
of the Gospel is accepted, never because faith in itself, as a good 
quality, could reconcile God. To ask a person first to establish 
the fact that he has faith and then to permit him to trust in divine 
grace is a Calvinistic error, not Lutheran practise. Passages such 
as Mark 16,15.16; Acts 16, 31; Rom. 10, 9, etc., which have been 
quoted to support the Reformed error, in reality command us to 
look away from ourselves and to cling to the objective Gospel 
promises of grace and salvation.

4. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS 

OF GRACE. 

In Reformed, as in rationalistic circles in general, the doctrine 
of the means of grace is commonly regarded as of no importance 
whatever. American Fundamentalism, for instance, stresses the 
doctrines: a) that the Bible is the Word of God; b) that Christ 
is the God-man, who died for the sins of the world; c) that the 
sinner is saved through faith in Christ’s blood; d) that Christ 
will gloriously return in His own appointed time; e) that Christ 
rose from the dead, and f) that there will be a final resurrection 
of all the dead. But Fundamentalism has no room at all in its 
system of theology for the Scriptural doctrine of the means 
of grace. 

On the other hand, Luther is being charged by modern theo¬ 
logians with having attached undue importance to this doctrine, 
following in this matter too closely the pattern of the Church of 
Rome. As a matter of fact, the great Reformer’s emphasis on the 
true doctrine of the means of grace was a real departure from, 
and a most decisive repudiation of, Romanism. He did not teach 
the doctrine of the means of grace because “he was still bound by 
the fetters of scholastic traditionalism,” but because Scripture 
itself attaches supreme significance to this doctrine. In the final 
analysis it was Luther’s loyalty to the Scriptural doctrine of sola 
gratia and sola fide that moved him to espouse and maintain the 
Biblical teaching of the means of grace. Without it he could not 
have taught the central article of the Christian faith, the so-called 
material principle of the Reformation, namely, justification by 
grace through faith in the satisfactio vicaria of Christ. 

That the doctrine of sola fide stands and falls with that of 
the means of grace we have already pointed out. Romanism has 
rejected the Scriptural doctrine of the means of grace, and it hae 
also rejected the sola fide. Calvinism, though avowing the sola fide 
in theory, denies it in practise; for on account of its denial ol 
universal grace it is obliged to comfort the alarmed and doubting 
believer with the experience of his “inward illumination,” or sanc¬ 
tification. Hence also in this case the perversion of the doctrine 
of the means of grace leads practically to the denial of the sola fide. 
The same may be said of enthusiasm and of rationalism in general. 
In every case the one error goes hand in hand with the other. 
The perversion of the doctrine of the means of grace always leads 
to the perversion of the central article of the Christian faith. 



458 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


namely, the doctrine of justification by faith without works. From 
this it is clear that the doctrine of the means of grace is indeed 
of the greatest importance for the preservation of the true Chris¬ 
tian faith. Those who consistently disavow this doctrine must dis¬ 
avow also the very heart of the Christian religion. 

Scripture itself stresses the doctrine of the means of grace as 
one of fundamental importance. In the first place, it teaches ex¬ 
pressly that regeneration, or conversion, occurs solely through the 
means of grace, that is, through the Word (1 Cor. 2,4. 5; 1 Pet. 
1, 23; Rom. 10, 17) and the Sacraments (Acts 2, 38; Matt. 28, 
19.20; 1 Pet. 3, 21; etc.). In the second place, it affirms most 
definitely that all who reject the means of grace forfeit salvation, 
Luke 7, 30; John 8,47; 1 Cor. 10, 21. 22; 11,26—29. In the 
third place, it shows clearly and emphatically that contempt for 
the means of grace is not a little sin, which God readily condones, 
but rebellion against the Lord of mercy and grace, 1 Cor. 1, 22. 23, 
which He punishes with eternal damnation, 1 Cor. 1, 18—21. 
26—29; Mark 16,15.16. 

It is a plain doctrine of Scripture that all who will not receive 
God’s grace as it is proffered to sinners in the means of grace shall 
not receive it at all, Matt. 10,14.15; Acts 13,46. 51. Hence the 
statements of the Reformed: “There is no place for the use of 
means”; “Nothing intervenes between the volition of the Spirit 
and the regeneration of the soul” (Hodge, Syst. Theol., II, 417. 
684. 685, etc.); “Tractatus internus est immediate operantis 
Spiritus” (Zwingli, De Providentia, opp. IV, 125); “Dux vel 
vehiculum Spiritui non est necessarium” (Zwingli, Fidei Ratio, 
p. 24), must be condemned as a virtual rejection of God’s grace 
in Christ Jesus as this is freely offered to sinners in the means of 
grace. As long as Calvinists maintain that “the influence of the 
Holy Spirit is directly upon the human spirit and is independent 
of the Word” (Shedd, Dog. Theol., II, 501), confessional Luther¬ 
anism must refuse them the hand of Christian fellowship and 
regard them as perverters of God’s way of salvation. (Cp. Pieper, 
Christl. Dogmatik, III, 156—223.) 

5. THE MEANS OF GRACE IN THE FORM OF ABSOLUTION. 

On the basis of clear Scripture-passages, Luther taught that 
the whole Gospel is nothing else than God’s free absolution of all 
sinners for Christ’s sake, 2 Cor. 5,19—21; Rom. 4, 25. On this 
fundamental truth the great Reformer based his entire doctrine 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


459 


regarding absolution, or the application of the general Gospel 
promises of forgiveness to individual persons, either in private 
confession (Privatbeichte) or in the general confession (allgemeine 
Beichte). 

As Luther, so also the Lutheran Confessions inculcate the 
doctrine of absolution with great emphasis. The Smalcald Articles 
(Art. VI) declare: "The keys are an office and power given by 
Christ to the Church for binding and loosing sin.” And the 
Apology (Art. XII) says: "The power of the keys administers and 
presents the Gospel through absolution, which proclaims peace to 
men and is the true voice of the Gospel”; Art. XI: "We should 
believe the absolution and regard it as certain that the remission 
of sins is freely granted us for Christ’s sake”; Art. VI: "We also 
retain confession, especially on account of the absolution, as being 
the word of God which by divine authority the power of the keys 
pronounces upon individuals.” Similarly the Small Catechism: 
"Confession embraces two parts. The one is that we confess our 
sins; the other, that we receive absolution, or forgiveness, from the 
confessor as from God Himself and in no wise doubt, but firmly 
believe, that our sins are thereby forgiven before God in heaven.” 

Absolution has been well defined as “that special form of ad¬ 
ministering the Gospel according to which a minister of the Church 
or any other Christian forgives one or more persons, upon their 
confession, their sins.” (Cp. Luther, St. L., XVI, 1795; X, 1235.) 
Luther: "Was ist die Absolution anders derm das Evmgelium 
einem einzelnen Menschen gesagt, der ueber seine bekannte Suende 
Trost dadurch empfahet” Hence absolution is nothing else than 
the Gospel individualized, or applied to individuals, Matt. 9, 2; 
Luke 7, 48, just as it is done in the Sacraments. What the Gospel 
offers to all men, absolution offers to the individual. 

The Scriptural doctrine of absolution has always been 
a stumbling-block to those who rejected the true doctrine of the 
means of grace. Zwingli said: "The assurance of our spirit that 
we are sons of God comes from the Spirit, not from the speaking 
confessor.” The Pietists even averred: "The confessional chair is 
a devil’s chair, a Satansstuhl." Because the Scriptural doctrine 
of absolution was not distinguished by them from that of Ro¬ 
manism, which indeed is a perversion of the Scriptural truth, it 
was branded as a "commandment of Antichrist,” etc. 

The true doctrine of absolution, however, is firmly founded 
upon Scripture. Christ’s words are clear and unmistakable: 



460 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


“Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall 
be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall 
be loosed in heaven,” Matt. 18,18. Again: “Whosesoever sins ye 
remit, they are remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, 
they are retained,” John 20, 23. (Cp. also Matt. 9, 8; 2 Cor. 2,10.) 

From these passages it is evident: a) that all who have 
received the Holy Ghost, that is to say, all true believers, are to 
remit or forgive sins; b) that this forgiveness relates to distinct 
persons (“whosesoever sins”); c) that all sins so forgiven by 
men are forgiven also before God in heaven (“they are remitted 
unto them”). 

It must be well understood that in absolution the forgiveness 
of sins is not merely announced to, or invoked upon, men, but 
actually conferred and conveyed, John 20, 23, just as this is done 
in the Gospel in general, Luke 24,47. Moreover, it is God who 
absolves from sin in absolution. There is not a twofold absolution, 
one pronounced by God and the other by man; but the absolution 
spoken by men is God’s absolution, pronounced by men in His 
stead. (Cp. Luther, St. L., XIX, 945.) The Augsburg Confession 
therefore rightly says (XXV): “Our people are being taught that 
they should highly prize the absolution as being the voice of God 
and pronounced by God’s command.” While the confession to the 
minister is an institution of the Church, the pronouncing of abso¬ 
lution to all who desire it is an institution of God. — Auricular 
confession is an antichristian abomination. (Cp. Luther, St. L., 
XI, 582 ff.) 

The absolution practised in the Roman Catholic Church is 
a caricature of the absolution instituted by Christ. Luther there¬ 
fore rightly denounced it as “altogether Pelagianistic, enthusiastic, 
and antichristian” (St. L., XIX, 943), because it is conditioned on 
the contrition, plenary confession, and satisfactions made by the 
applicant. Besides, absolution in the Roman Catholic Church is 
made dependent on the “intention” of the priest. — Another in¬ 
famous feature of papistic absolution is the “erring key,” which 
means that the absolution of the priest gives no assurance whatever 
that the sins are forgiven before God in heaven. Thus papistic 
absolution is utterly without consolation and assurance of salva¬ 
tion. But just that is what Roman Catholic theology desires: 
the sinner should not be sure of the forgiveness of his sins and of 
his salvation. 

In opposing the Lutheran and Scriptural doctrine of absolu- 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


461 


tion, Zwingli applied his supposed figure of speech, the so-called 
alloeosis, also to these words of the Savior, substituting for the 
personal pronoun "ye” the "Holy Ghost” so that they really mean: 
“Whosesoever sins the Holy Ghost remits, they are remitted.” 
Zwingli’s contention was that, when the Savior said: “Whosesoever 
sins ye remit” this was done out of pure divine friendship ("aus 
lauter goettlicher Freundschaft”). “Though Christ ascribes the 
binding and remitting to the disciples, yet this is solely the work 
of the operating Spirit; . . . hence there is attributed to the names 
of the apostles out of pure divine friendship what is solely the 
work of the Spirit.” (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, p. 225 ff.) 

The followers of Zwingli unanimously agreed to his doctrine 
and likewise denied the Biblical doctrine of absolution. The reason 
for this is not hard to find. Zwinglianism (Calvinism) teaches the 
errors of particular grace (“saving grace only for the elect”) and 
of the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit (immediata Spiritus 
Sancti operatio); but these two errors render absolution in the 
sense of Scripture impossible. According to Calvinism, no man 
can forgive the sins of any individual sinner, since, on the one 
hand, he cannot know whether the sinner is an elect or not, 
and because, on the other, this is the exclusive business of the 
Holy Spirit. 

In Lutheran circles the doctrine of absolution was disavowed 
by both the Pietists and the synergists. Pietism misunderstood 
the real meaning of the divine Gospel promises (denial of objec¬ 
tive reconciliation), while synergism, with its insistence on human 
cooperation in conversion, bases the remission of sins partly on 
man’s own good conduct, so that neither he who absolves nor he 
who is absolved can know in any given case whether the absolution 
is effective. In both cases these Lutheran teachers erred because 
they departed from the doctrine of Scripture and the Lutheran 
Confessions (rejection of the objective justification and of the 
sola gratia). 

Those who claim that the Lutheran doctrine of absolution is 
a “Romanistic leaven” ("roemischer Sauerteig”) fail to perceive 
the radical difference between the Biblical doctrine of absolution 
which the Lutheran Church advocates and the unbiblical doctrine 
of the Church of Antichrist. According to the papistic conception, 
absolution can be granted only by the priests (in severe cases only 
by the bishop or the Pope) upon adequate satisfaction rendered 
by the penitent individual (contritio cordis, confessio oris, satis- 



462 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


factio), the priest acting as judge to decide whether the satis¬ 
faction is sufficient. Absolution in that case depends on the sin¬ 
ner’s own worthiness, obtained by performing humanly prescribed 
penances, which are adjudged by human standards or values. The 
Boman Catholic doctrine of absolution is therefore in the fullest 
sense of the term a “commandment of men” (Matt. 15, 9) and as 
such cannot mediate forgiveness, but rather leaves the sinner under 
the curse, Gal. 3,10; 5, 4. 

Scripture, on the other hand, teaches: a) that the Office of 
the Keys (potestas clavium), that is, the peculiar power to forgive 
or retain sins, belongs to all Christians, John 20, 23; Matt. 18,18; 
16,19, so that every believer may absolve from sin as effectually 
as does a priest or bishop; and h) that absolution is based neither 
upon contrition (either fictitious or genuine) nor upon any satis¬ 
faction which the sinner renders for his sins (Boman Catholic 
doctrine), but alone upon the perfect reconciliation which Christ 
has made for all men by His vicarious obedience and upon God’s 
command (John 20,21; Luke 24,47) to preach remission of sins 
in His name among all nations. Absolution is therefore nothing 
else than the individual application of divine pardon for Jesus’ sake. 
Hence it should not be doubted or rejected, but rather be received 
in true faith, just as the divine promises of God must be believed 
which the Gospel proclaims in general to all sinners. 

From this it is also clear why, as Luther so emphatically says, 
every Christian may absolve. His right to absolve is as certain as 
that of preaching the Gospel, 1 Pet. 2, 9; in fact, absolution is only 
a special form of preaching the Gospel of grace and reconciliation. 

If Bomanists and Bomanizing Protestants aver that the power 
of remitting and retaining sins was granted by Christ only to the 
clergy, John 20, 22. 23, they fail to observe that our Lord on that 
occasion addressed not only the Twelve, but also other disciples; 
cp. John 20, 19. 24; Luke 24, 33. Dr. A. Spaeth, e. g., writes: 
“When this power was conveyed by the Lord, the apostles were not 
all present; nor were those present on this occasion all apostles. 
John clearly distinguishes between the Twelve (v. 24) and the dis¬ 
ciples (v. 19). And Luke tells us distinctly that others were gath¬ 
ered with the disciples on that evening, Luke 24, 33. Luther there¬ 
fore is right in saying: ‘This power is given to all Christians. 
Whosoever hath the Holy Spirit, to him this power is given, that is, 
to him who is a Christian.’ ” (Annotations to the Oospel according 
to St.John; cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 227 ff.) 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


463 


While some object to the doctrine of absolution on the ground 
of its being a “Romanistic leaven,” others do so because they say 
it is God’s exclusive prerogative to forgive sins. For this reason 
they regard it as blasphemous to ascribe to any man the power 
to forgive or retain sins. To this stricture we reply that it is 
indeed God’s prerogative to forgive sins; however, He does not 
exercise this prerogative immediately (by direct announcement), 
but mediately, through the Gospel, which He commands His be¬ 
lieving disciples to proclaim to every creature, Mark 16, 15. 16; 
Matt. 28, 19. 20. Hence God forgives sins through the very Word 
w r hich believers preach in His name, 2 Sam. 12,13; Luke 24, 47. 
Even when a person reads the divine Gospel promises and thus 
applies the absolution of the Gospel to himself, he receives for¬ 
giveness of sins not immediately (interior Spiritus illuminatio), 
but mediately, through the Word of the prophets and apostles, 
Eph. 2, 20. 

To the objection that the doctrine of absolution may mislead 
men both to carnal security and carnal pride (Priesterstolz) we 
reply that the abuse of a thing does not annul its right use. If the 
doctrine of absolution is not to be taught because it is subject to 
abuse, then we must neither preach the Gospel in general nor ad¬ 
minister the Sacraments in particular, since these are likewise sub¬ 
ject to abuse. In passing, we may remark that the doctrine of 
absolution can produce carnal security or spiritual pride only if 
it is proclaimed in a perverted form (Romanism). Absolution in 
the sense of Scripture always presupposes contrition and faith. 

To the objection that a minister cannot forgive sins because 
he does not know if the recipient is “worthy” or not we reply: 
Absolution does not depend on any worthiness in man, but on 
God’s grace in Christ Jesus, which has appeared to all men and 
should therefore also be proclaimed and offered to all. This is 
done both by the preaching of the Gospel in general and by the 
special promulgation of the Gospel in the form of absolution. 
Those who announce the grace of God in Christ Jesus to men 
never make a mistake; for there is no clavis errans, or Fehl- 
schluessel. The words of absolution are always as true as is the 
Gospel itself, of which absolution is only a special application. 
If any one fails to receive the forgiveness announced and proffered 
in absolution, the fault is his alone and not that of the absolution. 
For Christ’s sake God has graciously remitted the sins of the whole 
world, 2 Cor. 5, 19. 20, and absolution is nothing else than the 



464 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


proclamation of this gracious forgiveness to the individual. Every 
one who believes this glorious fact is in actual possession of com¬ 
plete pardon. 

Every objection to the Biblical doctrine of absolution is there¬ 
fore based upon a misunderstanding of what absolution really is; 
and absolution is misunderstood because men fail to comprehend 
the objective reconciliation which Christ made by His vicarious 
atonement. And this, again, they fail to comprehend because 
they base a sinner’s salvation, in part at least, on his own worthi¬ 
ness and not exclusively on God’s grace and Christ’s vicarious obe¬ 
dience (sola gratia, sola fide), offered to all men as a free gift in 
the means of grace. 

As soon as a believer understands that absolution is only the 
application of the general pardon offered and conveyed by the 
Gospel, he readily understands also why Baptism and the Lord’s 
Supper must be regarded as forms of private absolution. In both 
Sacraments God offers individually that grace which Christ has 
secured for the whole world by His death, Acts 2, 38; Matt. 26, 
26—28, and which is received by faith in His gracious Gospel 
promises. No matter in what manner the Gospel is applied to men, 
whether by general proclamation, or through Baptism, or the 
Lord’s Supper, or the act of absolution, the sinner is always ab¬ 
solved, that is, his sin is forgiven; for the same joyous, comforting 
message is heard alike in them all: “Be of good cheer; thy sins 
be forgiven thee,” Matt. 9, 2. 

From this it is evident that absolution should not be pro¬ 
nounced conditionally (“If you truly repent and truly believe, 
your sins are forgiven”), but always unconditionally (“Thy sins be 
forgiven thee”). It is true, forgiveness is received only by faith, 
and true faith dwells only in a contrite heart. From this point 
of view Luther correctly says that “every absolution has the condi¬ 
tion of faith”; but he adds: “yet only in so far as it receives the 
absolution and says yes to it” (St. L., XXIb, 1847fL). On the 
other hand, Luther most emphatically repudiates the doctrine that 
the forgiveness is based upon a person’s contrition and faith inas¬ 
much as these are good or meritorious works. 

If contrition and faith were meritorious acts, then indeed 
absolution would have to be pronounced conditionally. Since for¬ 
giveness, however, does not rest on any good work in man, but 
only on God’s gracious disposition toward the sinner in Christ 
Jesus, no condition whatever attaches to it. God actually forgives 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


465 


every sinner his transgressions for Christ’s sake, and this glorious 
truth should be announced to every sinner, and every sinner should 
believingly trust in it. Hence, as neither Baptism nor the Lord’s 
Supper is conditional (“I baptize you in case you truly believe”; 
“‘Take, eat; this is My body,’ if you truly believe”), so neither 
absolution is conditional. God’s forgiveness is truly offered to every 
sinner in every form of Gospel-preaching; for man’s unbelief never 
makes the faith of God without effect, Rom. 3, 3. In all cases 
therefore absolution is to be pronounced unconditionally. 

If, according to the custom of the Lutheran Church, the pro¬ 
nouncement of absolution is preceded by the questions: “Do you 
heartily repent of your sins, believe on Jesus Christ, and sincerely 
and earnestly purpose by the assistance of God the Holy Ghost 
henceforth to amend your sinful lives?” this is not to render 
absolution conditional, but merely to warn the secure and to com¬ 
fort the penitent. 

It is clear that the Scriptural doctrine of absolution can be 
maintained only by those who adhere to the Biblical doctrine of 
justification by grace, through faith in Christ Jesus. Romanism, 
synergism, and Calvinism err with regard to the doctrine of abso¬ 
lution just because they deny either the sola gratia or the gratia 
universalis. Where these two doctrines are denied, God’s amnesty 
must be based upon a condition in man; but where God’s amnesty 
is made to rest llpon “certain conditions” on the part of the sinner, 
absolution in the Scriptural sense becomes impossible. (Cp. Christl. 
Dogmatik, III, 223—248.) 

6. THE MEANS OF GRACE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ, that is, the gracious message of 
the forgiveness of sins through faith in the promised Savior, was 
the divine means of grace also during the whole time of the Old 
Testament, Acts 15,11. This is the clear testimony of Scripture, 
which tells us: “To Him give all the prophets witness that through 
His name whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of 
sins,” Acts 10, 43. In the promised Christ, Abraham believed, 
John 8, 56, and of Him Moses wrote, John 5, 46. St. Paul ex¬ 
pressly assures us that all New Testament believers are “Abraham’s 
children,” Gal. 3, 7, and “Abraham’s seed,” Gal. 3, 29, because they 
believe as Abraham did. 

In particular, the New Testament Scriptures declare that the 
Christian doctrine of justification by grace, through faith, without 

30 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



466 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


the deeds of the Law, is “witnessed by the Law and the prophets,” 
Bom. 3, 21. The entire fourth chapter of the Epistle to the 
Komans is designed to prove that the doctrine of justification by 
faith is a doctrine of the Old Testament. ■ Even after the Mosaic 
covenant was established, the Gospel of Christ as a means of grace 
was still in force, Gal. 3,17. 

It is true, when the promised Messiah appeared in the fulness 
of time, the Jews did not believe in Him; but this was not due 
to lack of adequate testimony concerning Him, but to their con¬ 
tempt for the clear witness of Moses, John 5, 45—47. So also the 
weak faith of the disciples in the crucified and risen Savior was 
owing to their disregard of the clear prophecies of the Old Testa¬ 
ment, Luke 24, 25. For the same reason also modern rationalistic 
theology denies the incontestable fact that ever since the Fall the 
Gospel of Christ has been the true means of grace by which sinners 
have become children of God through faith in the divine promise. 
It repudiates the Messianic character of clear Messianic prophecies, 
Gen. 3,15; 4,1; etc., just because it refuses to believe the witness 
of the prophets and, what is worse, that of Christ Himself and 
of His holy apostles, Luke 24, 25. In short, rationalism cannot 
find Christ and His vicarious atonement in the Old Testament 
because it does not believe the Gospel so clearly set forth in the 
New Testament. 

As the Gospel of Christ, so also the Circumcision and the 
Passover were means of grace, offering and conveying forgive¬ 
ness of sins. To the act of circumcision was attached the divine 
promise of grace: “I will be their God,” Gen. 17, 8, that is, their 
gracious God, who out of pure love freely forgives sin. This is 
evident from the fact that in the New Testament St. Paul calls 
the sign of circumcision “a seal of the righteousness of faith,” 
Bom. 4, 11. Of the Passover, Scripture distinctly says that it 
mediated grace to the Israelites; for they were spared in the 
plague, not as Jews, but because the passover lamb was killed and 
its blood was sprinkled on the lintel and the two side-posts. Ex. 12, 
21—27. For this reason God commanded: “And ye shall observe 
this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever,” 
Ex. 12, 24. Hence both to Circumcision and to the Passover was 
attached the divine promise of grace, and we therefore rightly speak 
of them as the Sacraments of the Old Testament. 

Luther writes: “It is a mistake [to believe] that the Sacra¬ 
ments of the New Testament differed from the Sacraments of the 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


467 


Old Testament according to their force and meaning [namely, 
as divinely appointed means of grace]. . . . Both our and the 
fathers’ signs, or Sacraments, have attached to them a word of 
promise, which demands faith and cannot be fulfilled by any other 
work. Therefore they are signs, or Sacraments, of justification.” 
(St. L., XIX, 62 ff.) Thus also in the Old Testament the Gospel 
and the Sacraments (Circumcision and the Passover) offered and 
conveyed to the believers divine grace and forgiveness. In other 
words, their function was precisely the same as is that of the means 
of grace instituted by Christ in the New Testament. 

7. THE MEANS OF GRACE AND PRAYER. 

In connection with the doctrine of the means of grace the 
question has been discussed whether also prayer may be classified 
among the means of grace. The query has been affirmed by the 
Calvinists. Hodge thus writes: “The means of grace, according 
to the standards of our Church, are the Word, Sacraments, and 
prayer " (Syst. Theol., Ill, 466; cp. p. 708.) However, while the 
term means of grace is a vox ftygatpoe and as such its meaning is 
not fixed by Scripture, so that we may employ it in various mean¬ 
ings, it is confusing to apply it to prayer in the same sense as it 
is applied to the Gospel and the Sacraments. 

The Word and the Sacraments are, as Luther expresses him¬ 
self, “God’s work upon us,” that is, means by which God deals 
with us; while prayer is the means by which the believer deals 
with God. Prayer, properly speaking, is a fruit of Christian faith 
and not the means by which faith is engendered. Through the 
Word and the Sacraments, God offers and conveys to us His grace 
and pardon. Through prayer we sue for temporal and spiritual 
blessings or render thanks to God for gifts received. 

Hence, when without further qualification prayer is called 
a means of grace, the distinctive difference between it and the 
Word and the Sacraments is ignored, just as also their various 
purposes are confused. Moreover, if prayer is regarded as a means 
of grace, then the error must follow that through prayer, or through 
a work of man, forgiveness of sins and salvation can be merited. 

As a matter of fact, those who regard prayer as a means of 
grace actually declare that God is thereby reconciled. They there¬ 
fore urge sinners who seek assurance of salvation to pray, whereas 
they ought to point out to them the grace of God in Christ Jesus, 
which is offered to all men in the Gospel and the Sacraments, and 



468 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


exhort them to put their trust wholly in the divine promises of 
pardon and peace. 

If the objection is raised that Christ Himself practically makes 
prayer a means of grace by teaching us to pray: “Forgive us our 
sins,” Luke 11, 4, we reply that believers indeed receive forgiveness 
of sins as also all other blessings of God by way of prayer, yet 
not because prayer is properly a means of grace, but simply because 
a true Christian prayer is an expression of faith in the divine 
promises. Properly speaking, it is not the prayer itself, that is, 
the speaking of words, but the Christian faith, of which the prayer 
is a manifestation, which secures forgiveness. Hence, whenever 
a true believer prays, he does not regard his prayer as another 
means of grace, in addition to the Word and the Sacraments, but 
his prayer rests upon the divine promises that are offered to him 
in the means of grace. What he really prays for is that God would 
be gracious to him and forgive his sins for Christ’s sake as He has 
promised to do in His blessed Gospel. 

Whenever a person prays on the supposition that his prayer 
is a meritorious work, on account of which God forgives sins, his 
prayer is not offered in the name of Jesus, but contrary to the 
direction of Jesus. It is not a manifestation of faith, but a mani¬ 
festation of unbelief; it is not a good work at all, but an abomina¬ 
tion in the sight of God, Gal. 3,10. To such a prayer the words 
of Christ apply: “When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the 
heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much 
speaking,” Matt. 6, 7. 

That the Calvinists regard prayer as a means of grace is quite 
intelligible from their point of view. Because they deny universal 
grace, they are unable to comfort an alarmed sinner with the gen¬ 
eral promises of grace offered in the Gospel; for these, according 
to Calvinistic doctrine, pertain only to the elect. Hence they must 
look for other means than the Gospel and the Sacraments by which 
to assure the terrified sinner of salvation, namely, acts of devotion 
(among which are prayers) that produce a sense or feeling of 
grace (sensus gratiae). Such assurance, however, since it rests 
upon human endeavors, is only imagination and not true Christian 
assurance, as has already been pointed out. 

However, not only Calvinists, but also synergists and Ar- 
minians regard prayer as a means of grace and also urge the 
alarmed sinner who desires assurance of salvation to seek this 
through prayer (Reformed revivalists, Lutheran Pietists). What 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEANS OF GRACE. 


469 


underlies this unscriptural advice is the denial of the sola gratia 
and, along with this, the repudiation of the objective reconciliation 
secured by Christ’s vicarious atonement and of the means of grace 
as the true conferring means (media doxixa), by which God freely 
offers Christ’s perfect righteousness to all men. From all this it is 
clear what a fatal mistake it is to regard prayer as a means of 
grace. Those who pray with the understanding that their suppli¬ 
cations are meritorious means, which secure grace and salvation, 
have practically rejected the Gospel of Christ and lapsed into 
paganism. 



470 


THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 

(De Discrimine Legis et Evangelii.) 

While the doctrines so far treated necessitated a constant 
reference to, and discussion of, the Law and the Gospel, so that 
practically everything has been said on this subject that need be 
said, nevertheless it is not superfluous to set forth the Scriptural 
teachings concerning the Law and the Gospel under a special head. 
Modern rationalism, just as Romanism and Zwinglianism (Zwingli: 
“In itself the Law is nothing else than a Gospel”; cp. Concordia 
Triglotta, p. 161ff.), has practically abolished the distinction 
between the Law and the Gospel, so that the two teachings are 
continually mingled into each other and the Biblical way of sal¬ 
vation is completely obscured (denial of the sola fide; salvation 
by work-righteousness). 

Confessional Lutheranism, on the other hand, regards the 
“distinction between the Law and the Gospel as a special brilliant 
light (clarissimum quoddam lumen), which serves to the end that 
God’s Word may be rightly divided and the Scripture of the holy 
prophets and apostles may be properly explained and understood” 
(j Formula of Concord, Thor. Decl., V, 1), and therefore assigns to 
the subject a prominent place in every orthodox dogmatic treatise. 
Despite this fact, however, Antinomianism, which is a perversion 
of the Scriptural doctrine of the Law and the Gospel, has caused 
confusion also within Lutheran circles (John Agricola, the Philip- 
pists. Poach, Otto, etc.), so that it is indeed necessary to give the 
matter adequate consideration. For these reasons we here treat 
the subject more fully under a special head. 

1. DEFINITION OF LAW AND GOSPEL. 

Scripture itself distinguishes very clearly between the Law and 
the Gospel and likewise our Lutheran Confessions. According to 
the Formula of Concord (Thor. Deck, V, 17) the Law, in its strict 
or proper sense (lex proprie accepta), is “a divine doctrine in 
which the righteous, immutable will of God is revealed, what is to 
be the quality of man in his nature, thoughts, words, and works, 
in order that he may be pleasing and acceptable to God; and it 
threatens its transgressors with God’s wrath and temporal and 
eternal punishments.” More briefly the Epitome of the Formula 
of Concord (Y, 3. 4) defines the divine Law in its proper sense as 
“a divine doctrine which teaches what is right and pleasing to God 
and reproves everything that is sin and contrary to God’s will,” so 



THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


471 


that “everything that reproves sin is, and belongs to, the preaching 
of the Law.” 

On the other hand, the Gospel, in its strict or proper sense 
(evangelium proprie acceptum), is defined by the same Confession 
as “such a doctrine as teaches what man who has not observed the 
Law and therefore is condemned by it is to believe, namely, that 
Christ has expiated, and made satisfaction for, all sins and has 
obtained and acquired for him, without any merit of his, . . . for¬ 
giveness of sins, righteousness that avails before God, and eternal 
life.” (Epitome, Y, 5.) 

This distinction between the Law and the Gospel is clear and 
Scriptural, so that we may describe as divine Law everything in 
Scripture that demands of man perfect obedience to God, Gal. 
3,12, pronounces His curse upon all transgressors, Gal. 3,10, ren¬ 
ders all the world guilty before God, Rom. 3, 19, and mediates 
knowledge of sin, Rom. 3, 20; and as Gospel everything that offers 
grace, peace, and salvation to the sinner, Rom. 1,16.17; 10,15; 
Acts 20, 24; Eph. 6,15; 1,13. 

It is true, both terms (Law and Gospel) are used in Scripture 
also in a wider sense, so that the term Law denotes the entire reve¬ 
lation of God as this is set forth in His Word, Ps. 1,2; Is. 2, 3, and 
the term Oospel the entire divine doctrine, Mark 1,1. This is done 
by way of synecdoche, so that the whole is named after a part 
(Gerhard: “ut ex parte digniori et potiori totum intelligatur”). 

This peculiar use of the term Gospel is recognized also by 
our Lutheran Confessions; for we read in the Formula of Concord 
(Thor. Decl., V, 3ff.) : “The term Gospel is not always employed 
and understood in one and the same sense, but in two ways in 
the Holy Scriptures. . . . For sometimes it is employed so that 
there is understood by it the entire doctrine of Christ, our Lord. . . . 
Furthermore the term Gospel is employed in another, namely, in 
its proper sense, by which it comprises . . . only the preaching of 
the grace of God.” 

2. FEATURES THAT ARE COMMON TO BOTH THE LAW 

AND THE GOSPEL. 

If we compare the two doctrines with each other, we find 
that they have several important elements in common. In the 
first place, both the Law and the Gospel are the divinely inspired 
Word of God. This point is essential. While the function of the 
Law is entirely different from that of the Gospel, it is nevertheless 
just as much God’s holy and inspired Word as is the Gospel, Matt. 



472 


THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


22, 37—40; Eom. 3, 21. In the second place, both doctrines, the 
Law as well as the Gospel, pertain to all men, so that they must 
always be taught side by side till the end of the world. So the 
Formula of Concord teaches: “From the beginning of the world 
these two proclamations . . . have been ever and ever inculcated 
alongside of each other in the Church of God, with a proper dis¬ 
tinction. . . . These two doctrines, we believe, . . . should ever and 
ever be diligently inculcated in the Church of God even to the 
end of the world.” (Thor. Decl., V, 23. 24.) 

The fact “that the Law and the Gospel must ever and ever 
be inculcated alongside of each other” must be maintained against 
Antinomianism, which, claiming that repentance (contrition) must 
be preached from the Gospel, denied that the Law should be in¬ 
culcated in the New Testament. John Agricola taught: “The 
Decalog belongs in the court-house, not in the pulpit”; that is to 
say, the Law is a matter of the State, not of the Church. Modified 
forms of Antinomianism were advocated and defended by Poach, 
Otto, etc., who said: “The Law must not be inculcated upon the 
regenerate.” The Philippists, on the other hand, claimed: “Unbe¬ 
lief must be reproved from the Gospel.” (Cp. Triglot, Hist. Intr., 
p. 161 fF.) The errors of Antinomianism are adequately refuted in 
Articles Y and VI of the Formula of Concord, which show clearly 
and convincingly that Antinomianism is neither Scriptural nor 
reasonable. 

Luther rightly characterizes the ingrained folly of Antinomi¬ 
anism when he writes: “They want to do away with the Law, and 
yet they teach [divine] wrath, something the Law alone must do. 
Hence they do nothing but cast aside the poor word Law, but con¬ 
firm the wrath of God, which is indicated and understood by this 
term, not to speak of the fact that they wring Paul’s neck and 
place the last first.” (St. L., XX, 161811.) 

Again: ‘Us it not blindness, yea, worse than blindness that he 
[Agricola] does not want to teach the Law without and before 
the Gospel? He is trying something that is impossible. How can 
one preach forgiveness of sins before sins are there [i. e., known] ? 
How can one announce life before death is there [t. e., known] ? . . . 
For grace must wage war, and be victorious in us, against the Law 
and sin, lest we despair.” (St. L., XX, 1659. 1656.) 

Dr. Bente ( Triglot, Hist. Intr., p. 161) says of Antinomianism 
that it “was a veiled effort to open once more the doors of the 
Lutheran Church to the Roman work-righteousness which Luther 



THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


473 


had expelled.” He writes: "When Luther opposed Agricola, the 
father of the Antinomians in the days of the Reformation, he did so 
with the clear knowledge that the Gospel of Jesus Christ with its 
doctrine of justification by grace and faith alone was at stake and 
in need of defense. ‘By these spirits,’ said he, ‘the devil does not 
intend to rob us of the Law, but of Christ, who fulfilled the Law’ 
(St. L., XX, 1614).” 

As a matter of fact, the Antinomians, in the final analysis, 
based their faith in the gracious forgiveness of sins on their renewal, 
or sanctification, particularly on the repentance that results from 
true love produced by the preaching of the Gospel. In this manner 
they intermingled justification and sanctification and restored the 
Romanistic doctrine of work-righteousness (justification by means 
of sanctification; gratia infusa). 

3. THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL CONSIDERED 
AS OPPOSITES. 

It was Luther who again proclaimed to the world that the 
Law and the Gospel are as widely distinct as they possibly can be, 
separated from each other more than opposites ("inter se longissime 
distincta et plus quam contradictoria separata sunt"). (St. L., 
IX, 447.) This must not be regarded as an extreme and “mis- 
understandable” statement (Thomasius, Dogmengeschichte, II, 
425); for it is a reaffirmation of the truth which Scripture itself 
teaches. 

When we compare the two doctrines according to their con¬ 
tents, we find that they absolutely contradict each other. The Law 
demands perfect obedience of man in every way and condemns all 
who are disobedient, while the Gospel demands nothing, but freely 
offers to all sinners grace, life, and salvation for Christ’s sake. 
The same sinners whom the Law consigns to everlasting damnation 
the Gospel, for Jesus’ sake, assigns to everlasting glory in heaven, 
Rom. 5,18—21. The Law requires works, Luke 10, 28; the Gospel 
declares that the sinner “is justified by faith, without the deeds 
of the Law,” Rom. 3, 28. 

St. Paul strikingly contrasts the Law and the Gospel when he 
writes: “There is no difference; for all have sinned and come 
short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace, 
through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,” Rom. 3, 22—24. 
According to these words the Law condemns, while the Gospel 
justifies. (Cp. also Gal. 3,10—14.) 



474 


THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


The same difference between the Law and the Gospel becomes 
evident when we consider their promises, which, too, are absolutely 
contradictory. The promises of the Law are conditional (promis- 
siones conditionales) ; those of the Gospel are promises of pure 
grace (promissiones gratuitae). That is to say, the Law promises 
life to the sinner provided he obeys it perfectly, Gal. 3,12; Luke 
10, 28; but the Gospel promises him life and salvation “without 
the deeds of the Law,” “without works,” “freely,” “by grace” 
(particular exclusivae), so that indeed “the ungodly are justified,” 
Rom. 4, 5. In other words, the Law justifies persons who are in 
themselves just. Gal. 3,21, while the Gospel justifies persons who 
in themselves are unjust, Rom. 4, 5. 

The so-called Gospel imperative (imperativus evangelicus. 
Acts 16, 31) is “concentrated Gospel.” When St. Paul commanded 
the keeper of the prison at Philippi: “Believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and thou shalt be saved,” he preached faith into his heart. 
So also the “command” of 1 John 3,23 is not a legal command, but 
a most gracious invitation, expressed in the strongest manner, to 
accept the Gospel offer of forgiveness. The faith demanded by the 
Gospel is described in Scripture as the very opposite of any human 
achievement, Eph. 2,8. 9. 

Prom this it is evident that the conditions of the Law, Luke 
10, 28, are real conditions, demanding absolute fulfilment of the 
imposed obligations. Gal. 3,12, while those of the Gospel (Rom. 
10, 9: “If thou shalt believe, thou shalt be saved”) merely indicate 
the means by which God applies to the sinner life and salvation 
(modus application^). The statement “If thou shalt believe, thou 
shalt be saved” means only this: Without any works or worthiness 
on thy part thou art saved alone by faith in the Lord Jesus, 
whom God has raised from the dead. Rom. 3,23—28. 

Since, then, the Law and the Gospel, considered according to 
their contents and promises, are absolute contradictions (plus quam 
contradictoria), we must clearly distinguish between the two 
spheres to which each belongs in the economy of salvation. That 
is the only correct way of removing the “insuperable difficulty” 
which confronts us as we view these two contradictoria according 
to their Scriptural presentation. 

The Law must indeed be preached in its full rigor and severity, 
and nothing dare be taken away from it, Matt. 5,17.18; Gal. 3,10; 
Rom. 1,18; 3, 9—19; but it must be proclaimed for no other pur¬ 
pose than to bring the sinner to a clear knowledge of his sin and 



THE LAW A>'D THE GOSPEL. 


475 


condemnation, Rom. 3, 20. That is the proper sphere of the Law, 
as Scripture plainly shows, 2 Cor. 3, 9: “the ministration of con¬ 
demnation.” It is a message of wrath and as such “our school¬ 
master unto Christ that we might be justified by faith,” Gal. 3, 24. 

However, when the Law has accomplished its purpose and 
the contrite sinner cries out in fear: “What must I do to be saved ?” 
Acts 16, 30, then the proclamation of the Law must cease and that 
of the Gospel must set in, Acts 16, 31; for, while it is the function 
of the Law to terrify the secure sinner, it is the function of the 
Gospel to comfort the contrite sinner with the grace of God in 
Christ Jesus, John 3, 16; Rom. 10, 4. This sharp distinction 
between the two spheres of the Law and the Gospel is always ob¬ 
served in Scripture, 2 Sam. 12,13; Acts 2, 37—39; 1 Cor. 5,1—5; 
2 Cor. 2, 6—8. 

Luther writes: “The Law has its goal, just how far it must 
go and how much it must accomplish, namely, ‘unto Christ/ to 
terrify the impenitent with God’s wrath and disfavor. In the same 
manner also the Gospel has its work and function, namely, to 
preach forgiveness of sins to the troubled conscience. . . . Now, 
where conscience is rightly awakened, duly feels its sins, and is in 
agony of death, . . . there it is high time to know how to separate 
the Law from the Gospel and to put each in its place.” (St. L., 
IX, 798 ff.) 

Generally speaking, then, the Law belongs to the sphere of 
sin and the Gospel to that of grace; the first is the message of 
repentance (contrition), the second that of remission of sins, 
Luke 24, 47. Both must be taught in their Scriptural purity and 
truth; the rigor and severity of the Law must not be diminished, 
nor must the sweetness and winsomeness of the Gospel be modified, 
for only in that way can the divine message of sin and grace enter 
the sinner’s heart and transform it. 

The Law and the Gospel differ from each other also with 
respect to their principia cognoscendi. While the Law is written 
in the hearts of men, Rom. 2,14.15, and may thus, in part at least, 
be known even without the revealed knowledge of Scripture, the 
Gospel is the “hidden wisdom of God,” made known to man by 
special revelation, 1 Cor. 2, 7—12; Rom. 16, 25, so that not a single 
person can know it unless it is revealed to him, Mark 16, 15; 
Rom. 10,14.15.17. This is demonstrated and proved by the fact 
that all man-made religions are “religions of the Law,” or of good 
works, while the Christian religion, which is taken from the Bible 



476 


THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


as its only source, is a “religion of faith.” Moreover, all men who 
are addicted to the natural religion of good works reject the re¬ 
ligion of faith as foolishness, 1 Cor. 1, 23; 2,14, until through the 
Gospel the Holy Spirit has removed from them the opinio legis, 
2 Cor. 3,15.16. 

In the course of the Antinomian controversy the question was 
debated whether the sin of unbelief must be reproved from the 
Law (Gnesio-Lutherans) or from the Gospel (Philippists). The 
answer of the Gnesio-Lutherans was adopted and embodied in the 
Formula of Concord (cp. Arts. Y and VI). The Philippists were 
perhaps misled by the consideration that, since the divine Law is 
ignorant of Christ and of faith in Him, it cannot reprove the sin 
of unbelief. But the question is readily settled if we bear in mind 
the specific spheres and functions of the Law and the Gospel; for 
while the Law always judges, condemns, and reproves, the Gospel, 
in its proper sense, never judges, condemns, and reproves. It is 
therefore against the very nature of the Gospel to reprove. 

The statement “The Gospel reproves sin” (Melanchthon) can 
be defended only if the term Gospel is used in its wider sense, as 
denoting the entire doctrine of Christ. However, that the Gospel 
in its strict sense does not reprove either the sin of unbelief or any 
other sin is obvious from the fact that, if the Gospel would be 
properly a message of reproof and condemnation, salvation would 
be absolutely impossible; for in that case there would be no mes¬ 
sage of salvation in which sinners, who by nature are all unbe¬ 
lievers, might trust. The Gospel saves. Bom. 1,16, just because it 
has only a saving and not a reproving or condemning function. 
Unintentionally, yet actually, the Philippists changed the Gospel 
into Law by ascribing to it in its proper sense a reproving office. 

The Formula of Concord concedes that the Gospel (or rather 
the Gospel facts, namely, Christ’s suffering and death) may indeed 
be used to depict the great wrath of God on account of man’s sin, 
just as Christ Himself so used it, Luke 23, 31. Yet when the 
Gospel is employed in this manner, it performs not its own and 
proper office (proprium suum officium), but a foreign office (alie- 
num opus). Our Confession (Thor. Decl., V, 12) says: “Yea, 
what more forcible, more terrible declaration and preaching of 
God’s wrath against sin is there than just the suffering and death 
of Christ, His Son ? But as long as all this preaches God’s wrath 
and terrifies men, it is not yet the preaching of the Gospel nor 
Christ’s own preaching, but that of Moses and the Law against the 



THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


477 


impenitent. For the Gospel and Christ were never ordained and 
given for the purpose of terrifying and condemning, but of com¬ 
forting and cheering those who are terrified and timid.” The last 
truth here stressed must never be left out of mind; for the Gospel 
in its proper sense never reveals sin or terrifies the sinner, but 
always shows divine grace and consoles the alarmed sinner. 

In concluding this chapter, we may call attention to the fact 
that the Law and the Gospel are only different aspects of God 
Himself in His relation to the sinner. The Law shows God as 
He condemns the sinner on account of his sin (Deus propter pec- 
cata dammns), while the Gospel describes Him as freely forgiving 
and justifying the sinner for Christ’s sake (Deus propter Christum 
absolvens et iustificans). This fact the Christian theologian must 
always bear in mind when he determines the spheres and functions 
of the Law and the Gospel. 

4. THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE LAW 
AND THE GOSPEL. 

While the Law and the Gospel are radically distinct from each 
other so far as their content is concerned, they nevertheless must 
be closely conjoined in their practical application. Luther writes 
of this (St. L., IX, 454) : “Although these two [doctrines] are 
most remote so far as their content (re ipsa) is concerned, yet at 
the same time they are most intimately linked together in one and 
the same heart. Nothing is more fastly bound together than are 
fear and faith, Law and Gospel, sin and grace. They are indeed 
so united that one is swallowed up by the other (absorbeatur). 
Therefore there can be no mathematical conjunction which is like 
to this.” 

This close connection of the Law and the Gospel becomes 
apparent when we consider the sinner’s conversion. As we have 
shown in a previous chapter, conversion takes place in the very 
moment when a penitent sinner personally trusts in the gracious 
promises of the Gospel; or we may briefly say, his conversion is 
effected through the Gospel. However, in order that the Gospel 
may accomplish its comforting and saving function, the Law must 
first convict the sinner of his sin and guilt, terrify and humble him, 
and cause him to despair of his own efforts to save himself, Eom. 
3,19. 20. 23. 24. Thus the conversion of a sinner requires and pre¬ 
supposes the preaching of both the Law and the Gospel. The Law 
must first point out to the sinner his spiritual death in order that 



478 


THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


he may rejoice in the spiritual life which the Gospel gives. The 
Law must convince him of God’s righteous demand in order that 
he may be willing to accept by faith the free gifts of the Gospel. 
The Law must proclaim sin in order that the Gospel can pro¬ 
claim grace. 

When speaking of the second use of the divine Law, our 
dogmaticians rightly distinguish between its usus elenchticus (the 
revealing and convicting of sin, Rom. 3, 20) and its usus paedar 
gogicus (“our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,” Gal. 3, 24). 
However, it must be borne in mind that the Law itself does not lead 
to Christ, but only to despair. But it serves the coming to Christ 
(compulsus indirectus) by pointing out to the sinner his need. 
When the Law has terrified the sinner, Christ is at hand to pro¬ 
claim to him the comfort of the Gospel. That the Law by itself 
does not produce any moral change and improvement in the sin¬ 
ner’s heart, predisposing it for the reception of the Gospel, is 
taught in such passages as 2 Cor. 3, 6b; Rom. 7, 5. 8. The Gospel 
must therefore go hand in hand with the Law if the sinner is to 
be converted and saved. 

This intimate connection between the Law and the Gospel the 
Antinomians denied when they tried to relegate the Law out of 
the Church. But in the final analysis their opposition to the Law 
was opposition to the Gospel; for as Luther rightly says (St. L., 
XX, 1646) : “If the Law is removed, no one can know what Christ 
is or what He has done when He fulfilled the Law for us.” The 
great Reformer clearly perceived that “the devil through this en¬ 
thusiasm (Antinomianism) meant to remove not the Law, but 
Christ, the Fulfiller of the Law” (XX, 1614). 

Again, the close connection of the Law and the Gospel be¬ 
comes apparent also when we consider the sanctification of the 
believer. It is true, according to the inward, or new, man the 
believer does not require the Law, 1 Tim. 1, 9, since, as a new crea¬ 
ture in Christ, he has the divine Law written in his heart, Jer. 
31, 33; Ezek. 36, 26, and obeys it as cheerfully and willingly as 
Adam did before the Fall, Ps. 110, 3. The Formula of Concord 
rightly declares (Thor. Decl., VI, 17): “But when a man is born 
anew by the Spirit of God and liberated from the Law, that is, 
freed from this driver, and is led by the Spirit of Christ, he lives 
according to the immutable will of God comprised in the Law and, 
so far as he is born anew, does everything from a free, cheerful 
spirit.” 



THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


479 


However, the situation becomes quite different when we view 
the believer according to the flesh, which still cleaves to him, 
Rom. 7,14—24. According to the old man the believer neither 
knows the Law thoroughly nor does he fulfil it willingly, Rom. 
7,15, but he constantly opposes and transgresses it, Rom. 7,18. 

Luther says (St. L., IX, 881) : “According to the spirit the 
believer is righteous, without any sin whatsoever, and does not 
require the Law; but according to the flesh he still has sin. . . . 
Since, then, sin still exists [in us]. Scripture judges us to be equal 
to the unrighteous and sinners, so that according to the flesh we 
must have the Law just as much as they.” 

So also the Formula of Concord remarks (Thor. Decl., 
VI, 18 ff.) : “Since believers are not completely renewed in this 
world, but the Old Adam clings to them even to the grave, there 
also remains in them the struggle between the spirit and the flesh. 
Therefore they delight indeed in God’s Law according to the inner 
man, but the law in their members struggles against the Law in 
their mind; hence they are never without the Law and neverthe¬ 
less are not under, but in the Law and live and walk in the Law of 
the Lord and yet do nothing from constraint of the Law.” 

Together with the Gospel the believer must therefore also use 
the divine Law, namely, a) as a curb, to crucify his evil flesh, 
Rom. 8, 7; 1 Cor. 9, 27; b) as a mirror, which constantly reveals 
his sins, Rom. 7, 7.13; Gal. 5,19—21; and c) as a rule, according 
to which he must regulate and direct his whole life, Gal. 5, 22—25. 
Hence even the regenerate must continually employ the Law in 
close connection with the Gospel: the Law to curb his flesh out¬ 
wardly, the Gospel to destroy it inwardly; the Law to point out 
good works, the Gospel to give him power to do good works; the 
Law to show him his sins, the Gospel to teach him how he may 
be cleansed from sin. 

There is, of course, no contradiction between such passages as 
1 Tim. 1, 9 : “The Law is not made for a righteous man” and those 
which apply the Law in all its uses to the Christian, e. g., Rom. 7, 
23.24; 1 Cor. 9, 27; etc. In the former passage the Christian is 
described according to the new man; in the latter, according to 
his old, corrupt nature. Luther rightly says: “Ein Christ ist 
zwischen zwei Zeiten geteilt. Sofern er Fleisch ist, ist er unter 
dem Gesetz; sofern er Geist ist, ist er unter der Gnade.” 
(Cp. St. L., IX, 452. 880.) 

Conversion and sanctification are therefore the result of the 



480 


THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


cooperation, of the Law and Gospel. The preaching of the Law 
alone results in hypocrisy or despair; the preaching of the Gospel 
alone results in indifference and security. (Cp. Luther, St. L., 
V, 988; also Dr. Bngelder, Dogmatical Notes.) 

For the sake of completeness we may here add that our dog- 
maticians speak of a fourfold use of the divine Law, each of which 
applies also to the believer. The Law holds in check the flesh of 
the Christian and coerces it to external discipline (usus politicos); 
it reveals to him, and convinces him of, his sin (usus elenchticus) ; 
it is his schoolmaster to bring him unto Christ (usus paedago- 
gicus) ; it furnishes him with a safe rule of life (perpetua vivendi 
regula. Matt. 5,17; usus didacticus). 

5. THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE LAW 
AND THE GOSPEL. 

While it is comparatively easy to distinguish between the Law 
and the Gospel in theory, it is extremely difficult to apply the dis¬ 
tinction in practise. Luther very correctly remarks that the true 
j distinction between the Law and the Gospel in practise lies beyond 
1 the natural powers of man and can be accomplished only through 
1 the operation of the Holy Ghost. The reason for this is to be 
' found in the natural disposition of man, who persistently clings 
to the opinio legis, that is to say, to the desire to save himself by 
work-righteousness. To this basic error also the believer is subject, 
namely, in so far as he is flesh. Hence he is constantly tempted to 
misapply the Law and the Gospel, so that he must ceaselessly pray 
God for illumination by His Holy Spirit, Ps. 143,10. 

However, still more difficult is the task of the Christian pastor, 
who must rightly divide the Word of Truth in his official capacity 
as a minister of Jesus Christ, 2 Tim. 2, 15. Here the words of 
Luther hold: “Whoever knows well this art of dividing the Law 
from the Gospel, him put in the first place and call him a doctor 
of Holy Scripture.” The Christian minister must constantly teach 
the Law and the Gospel side by side, with proper regard for both 
their distinction and their connection, so that the secure are terri¬ 
fied and the terrified are comforted. He must never commingle 
the two doctrines, but teach the Law in all its severity and the 
Gospel in its full sweetness. 

Those who earnestly apply themselves to this task will readily 
agree with Luther, who says (St. L., IX, 798ff.) : “Without the 
Holy Ghost it is impossible to make this distinction [sc., between 



THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


481 


the Law and the Gospel]. I know it from my own experience and 
also daily perceive it in others how hard it is to separate the doc¬ 
trine of the Law from that of the Gospel. Here the Holy Ghost 
must be the Master and Teacher, otherwise no man on earth will 
be able to understand or teach it. The art is easily taught; it can 
be quickly said that the Law is a word and doctrine different from 
the Gospel; but to distinguish them practically and to apply the 
art is labor and sorrow.” 

But while it is very difficult to distinguish the Law from the 
Gospel, it is absolutely necessary to do so, since without a proper 
distinction of the two doctrines there can be no saving faith and 
therefore also no true Christianity. Luther draws attention to this 
fact when he writes (St. L., IX, 798 ff.): “If a mistake occurs at 
this point, it is impossible to tell a Christian from a heathen or 
a Jew; so important is the distinction.” 

Luther’s reason for this verdict is not hard to understand. 
The cardinal doctrine of the Christian faith is that of justification 
by grace, through faith (sola gratia; sola fide). In order to teach 
this doctrine in its Scriptural purity, it is necessary to exclude 
from it every demand of the Law, or every good work. As Luther 
says, justification must not be made to depend even on a pious 
Lord’s Prayer if the full truth of the Christian doctrine is to be pre¬ 
served. If at this point the severity of the divine Law is modified 
and the Gospel of divine grace in Christ is not presented in all its 
Scriptural sweetness, the sinner will never be truly contrite, nor 
will he cast himself entirely upon the mercy of God in Christ Jesus 
for his salvation. In short, unless the Gospel is strictly distin¬ 
guished from the Law, it is impossible to teach justification 
by faith. 

From this it furthermore follows that it is also impossible to 
comfort a sinner with the assurance of salvation if Law and Gospel 
are commingled. In other words, if in the article of justification 
the Law is mingled into the Gospel, so that man’s salvation is 
made to depend on his fulfilment of God’s righteous demands, he 
must forever doubt his state of grace; for it is then taken out of 
the almighty hand of God and placed into his own impotent hands. 
The mingling of the Law and the Gospel at this point therefore 
deprives a person of the greatest blessing which Christianity offers 
to the world, namely, the certitudo gratiae et salutis by faith in 
Christ Jesus, for whose sake God freely justifies the sinner who 
comes short of the glory of God, Rom. 3, 23. 24. 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 


31 



482 


THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


Luther says of this (St. L., IX, 619): “It is impossible that 
Christ and the Law should be able to dwell together in the heart; 
for either Christ or the Law must depart.” What Luther means 
is this: Man trusts for salvation either in works or in Christ; or, 
what is the same, he desires to be saved either by the Law or by 
the Gospel. Between the two there is no middle ground. But woe 
to the sinner who trusts for salvation in the Law, Gal. 3,10; 5, 4! 
Since he is unable to keep it, he is forever under its curse. Thus 
the mingling of the Law and the Gospel deprives the sinner of that 
true comfort which alone can sustain him in life and console him 
in death — the sure hope of salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 

Lastly, without the proper distinction between the Law and 
the Gospel it is also impossible to understand the Scriptures. The 
Formula of Concord directs attention to this point by calling the 
distinction between the Law and the Gospel “a special brilliant 
light, which serves to the end that God’s Word may be rightly 
divided and the Scriptures of the holy prophets and apostles may 
be properly explained and understood” (Thor. Decl., Y, 1). This 
statement of our Confession is no exaggeration; for, on the one 
hand, Scripture clearly says: “This do, and thou shalt live,” Luke 
10,28, and, on the other: “A man is justified by faith, without 
the deeds of the Law,” Horn. 3, 28. These statements are in them¬ 
selves contradictory, just as contradictory as are yes and no. To 
remove the difficulty, the Antinomians endeavored to banish the 
Law from the Church to the court-house, so that within the Church 
nothing should be taught but the Gospel alone. But this pro¬ 
cedure is unscriptural; for it is God’s express will, set forth in 
His Word, that the Law (Moral Law) should be proclaimed with¬ 
out any qualification or abridgment to the end of time, Matt. 5,18. 

Modern rationalistic theologians try to do away with the 
contradiction by changing the Gospel into a law; but upon all who 
in this way empty the Gospel of its glorious content, God’s Word 
pronounces the divine curse, Gal. 1,8; 6,14. In short, the contra¬ 
diction must not be removed by discarding either of the two doc¬ 
trines, but by properly distinguishing between the two and assign¬ 
ing each to its proper sphere. If that is done, we can readily 
understand why, on the one hand. Scripture says: “The man that 
doeth them (sc. the works of the Law) shall live in them,” Gal. 
3,12, and, on the other: “A man is not justified by the works of 
the Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ,” Gal. 2,16; for in that 
case we remember that the Law has been given us that we might 



THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


483 


come to the knowledge of our sins, Rom, 3, 20, and the Gospel, 
that we might obtain forgiveness of sins. In short, if we properly 
distinguish between the Law and the Gospel, the Bible will be to 
us a clear book; if we do not, it will forever remain dark and 
incomprehensible. 

The truth of this statement is proved by the false attitude of 
the Romanists and of Protestant synergists toward the vital ques¬ 
tion of certainty of salvation (certitudo saiutis). These errorists 
commingle the Law and the Gospel by denying the sola gratia and 
teaching, either directly or indirectly, salvation by works. In con¬ 
sequence they maintain that a believer cannot be sure of his sal¬ 
vation (monstrum incertitudinis). This means wilful rejection of 
a clear Scripture doctrine, Rom. 8, 38. 39; yet they attempt to base 
their false claim on Scripture, 1 Cor. 10,12. They fail, however, to 
distinguish between the Law and the Gospel. Misled by their basic 
error, they forget that passages such as 1 Cor. 10, 12; Heb. 
12,14, etc., are Law, designed to warn and terrify the secure and 
indifferent, while passages such as Rom. 8, 38. 39; John 10,27—29; 
3,16—18, etc., are Gospel, intended for the comfort of the contrite 
and penitent. According to the old man, believers always need the 
warnings of the Law, while according to the new man they rejoice 
in the sure hope of salvation held out to them in the precious 
Gospel, Rom. 6,1—5. It is therefore absolutely necessary that the 
believer in general, as he privately judges his own state of grace, 
but especially the Christian minister, as he officially proclaims the 
divine way of salvation, clearly and sharply distinguish between 
Law and Gospel, 2 Tim. 2,16. 

But this can be done only when God bestows Bis grace upon 
us and keeps us in His grace. His Holy Spirit must teach and 
lead us to distinguish between the Law and the Gospel and to apply 
both in the right order. Without the illumination and guidance 
of the Holy Ghost no one can appeal from the condemnation of 
the Law to the blessed Gospel promises of forgiveness of sins, life, 
and salvation and trust in them. That is the Spirit’s gracious 
work in us, Eph. 1,19. 20; Phil. 1,29; Col. 2,12, just as perse¬ 
verance in faith, by constant trust in the Gospel promises, is God’s 
work in us, 1 Pet. 1, 5. Again, though the Law accuses and con¬ 
demns man, nomism, which makes the Law the means of salvation 
by way of sanctification, is so deeply rooted in his flesh that as 
a born legalist he trusts in the works of the Law for salvation and 
refuses to appeal from the Law to the Gospel, which to the flesh 



484 


THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


is both a stumbling-block and foolishness, 1 Cor. 1, 23. Hence God 
must help and save us, working in us both to will and to do, 
Phil. 2,13. Without His grace we can do nothing also in the matter 
of making the proper distinction between the Law and the Gospel. 
(Cp. Luther, St. L., IV, 2077 f.; IX, 446 ff.; XXII, 760 f.; 
V, 1171.) 

6. BY WHOM THE PROPER DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE 
LAW AND THE GOSPEL IS SET ASIDE. 

The proper distinction between the Law and the Gospel is 
set aside and hence Law and Gospel are commingled by — 

a. The Romanists, who mingle the Law and the Gospel in the 
interest of their pernicious teaching of work-righteousness and of 
the uncertainty of salvation. The Council of Trent expressly 
anathematizes the doctrine that the “Gospel is the absolute and 
unconditional promise of eternal life, without the condition that 
he [man] must first keep the Law” (Sess. VI, Can. 20). 

b. The Calvinists, who deny the gratia universalis and the 
operation of the Holy Ghost through the divinely appointed means 
of grace. In consequence of these errors they do not proclaim the 
universal Gospel promises of grace to all sinners, but condition 
the sinner’s salvation on his compliance with the prescribed 
conditions on which God will accept the sinner. According to 
Charles Hodge the “external call” is “a promise of acceptance in 
the case of all those who comply with the conditions,” while the 
Gospel is “a proclamation of the terms on which Ood is willing 
to save sinne. s and an exhibition of the duty of fallen men in 
relation to thtt plan” ( Syst. Theol., II, 642). Thus, in the final 
analysis, the Calvinists commit the same fatal mistake as the 
Romanists. 

c. The synergists, who deny the sola gratia and make salvation 
depend on the sinner’s own decision for grace. According to 
synergism the Gospel is a message of God promising grace to all 
who will apply themselves to grace. Synergism is therefore a re¬ 
turn to the Pelagianistic camp of Romanism. 

d. All Modernists, who deny the satisfactio vicaria; for, since 
they deny the vicarious atonement of Christ, they must teach salva¬ 
tion by works or the sinner’s own atonement for his sins. 

e. Certain modern theologians, who affirm a “higher unity” 
("hoehere Einheit”) between the Law and the Gospel. According 
to their opinion the difference between the Law and the Gospel is 



THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL. 


485 


one only of degree, not one of kind; for both, as it is falsely 
claimed, demand of the sinner moral works. In that case the 
Gospel, in the final analysis, is only a modified Law. This erroneous 
view, of course, completely annuls the distinction between the two 
doctrines. It converts the Gospel into Law and makes the sinner’s 
salvation depend on his own obedience. 

Luther, who is represented by these errorists as favoring this 
pernicious opinion, in reality distinguished between the Law and 
the Gospel as plus quam contradictoria. 

In closing this chapter, we may call attention to the fact that 
in all cases where the Law and the Gospel are mingled into each 
other the purpose is always the same, namely, to eliminate the 
"foolish preaching” of the crucified and risen Savior as man’s only 
hope of salvation and to confirm the pagan doctrine of salvation 
by works (opinio legis). 

The result of all error in theology is, in the final analysis, 
the elimination of "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin 
of the world,” John 1, 29. Luther says very correctly (St. L., 
XX, 873): “Whoever denies, blasphemes, or dishonors Christ in 
one point or article can teach or honor Him rightly in no 
other place.” 

In a more subtle way the Law and the Gospel are commingled 
by all who weaken the rigor of the Law, teaching that God is 
satisfied if men obey it as much as they can; by all who inject 
legal elements into the Gospel, depriving it of its sweetness; and 
by all who proclaim the Law to terrified sinners and the Gospel to 
such as are secure and carnally indifferent. The Law and the 
Gospel may thus be commingled with respect to their nature and 
contents, with respect to their functions, and with respect to the 
persons dealt with. But whenever the Law and the Gospel are 
commingled, the doctrine of justification by grace and the cer¬ 
tainty of salvation are destroyed. In fact, where the distinction 
between the Law and the Gospel is not known and practised, there 
no man can become or remain a Christian. Luther’s words there¬ 
fore deserve careful consideration: “This distinction between Law 
and Gospel is the supreme art in Christianity, which all who glory 
in, and bear, the Christian name may and should understand.” 
(St. L., IX, 798.) 



486 


THE DOCTRINE Or HOLT BAPTISM. 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM. 

(De Baptismo.) 


1. THE DIVINE INSTITUTION OF BAPTISM. 

Baptism is not a mere church rite, but a divine ordinance (in- 
stitutio divina), which is to be in force till the end of time and must 
be observed by all Christians, Mark 16, 15. 16; Matt. 28, 19. 20. 
The command to baptize was given by Christ as emphatically as 
was that of preaching the Gospel, a fact which the apostles duly 
recognized, Acts 2, 38; 10,48. This must be maintained despite the 
fact that it was St. Paul’s special mission to evangelize rather than 
to baptize, 1 Cor. 1,14.15; for throughout his epistles he teaches 
both the necessity and the efficacy of Baptism, Rom. 6, 3. 4; Gal. 
3, 27; Titus 3,4—7; etc. Hence, if Quakers, the Salvation Army, 
and other enthusiasts reject Baptism as a mere “ceremony, which 
is not binding on the conscience,” they reject God’s own institution 
and ordinance. However, their rejection of Holy Baptism is only 
a corollary to their repudiation of the doctrine of the means of 
grace in general. 

Modern rationalistic theologians (Holtzmann) deny the divine 
institution of Holy Baptism, though they admit that Baptism was 
a common practise in the early Christian Church. But all their 
arguments (Paul baptized only in exceptional cases, 1 Cor. 1,14; 
Peter himself did not baptize, Acts 10, 48; Jesus did not baptize, 
but only taught, John 3, 22; 4, 2) cannot overthrow the clear words 
of Matt. 28,19. 20 and Mark 16,15.16, where the divine institu¬ 
tion of Holy Baptism is unmistakably taught. 

Modern rationalizing theologians of a more conservative ten¬ 
dency indeed admit the divine institution of Baptism, but object 
to the so-called ‘legalistic character” of this ordinance. In reply 
to this rather vague argument we say that the Church’s obliga¬ 
tion to baptize is no more “legalistic” than is its duty to proclaim 
the Gospel. If men can be saved without Baptism, the reason is 
not that Baptism is “more legalistic” than is the proclamation of 
the Gospel, but that God in His infinite grace offers to the 
sinner already through the Word of the Gospel His entire grace 
with complete pardon. However, this fact does not make Baptism 
superfluous; for God, who is “superabundantly rich in His grace,” 
wishes to give us “counsel and aid against sin not merely in one 
way” (Smalcald Art., Part III, Art. IV). Assuredly, our blessed 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM.

Lord, who has instituted Baptism, does not want us to despise this 
holy and salutary Sacrament, Luke 7,30. 

The divine command to baptize always calls for water as the 
visible element that should be used in this Sacrament, John 3, 23; 
Acts 8, 36, so that the employment of any substitute renders 
Baptism invalid. All those of whose baptism we can obtain 
no reliable proof must be regarded as not having been baptized. 
(Cf. Luther, St. L., X, 2128ff.) 

While the use of water in Baptism is necessary, the manner 
in which it is applied (modus applicandi) is optional, since the 
Greek verb ftamiCeiv means not only to immerse, but also to wash 
(cf. Luke 11, 38; Mark 7,3, where pamiteo&ai means as much as 
vimeo&ai, or wash). Therefore our Lutheran Catechism rightly 
holds that to baptize means to “apply water by washing, pouring, 
sprinkling, or immersing.” To those who insist that Baptism must 
be by immersion because it symbolizes burial into death, Rom. 
6, 3. 4, our dogmaticians reply that Baptism signifies not only 
burial, but also the washing away of sins, Acts 22, 16, the out¬ 
pouring of the Holy Ghost, Titus 3, 5. 6, and the sprinkling with 
the blood of Christ, Heb. 10, 22, cp. with Ex. 24, 8; Heb. 9,19; 
1 Cor. 10, 2, so that any one of the different modes of applying the 
water symbolizes its meaning. 

If the objection is made that immersion is necessary because 
the entire person must be cleansed by Baptism, we answer that the 
cleansing power of Baptism does not lie in the amount of water 
used, but in the Sacrament itself, so that whoever receives it in 
any form is completely cleansed, John 13, 9.10. 

In passing, we may remind the reader that usually those who 
insist upon immersion because “Baptism must symbolize the burial 
into death” deny the very efficacy of the Sacrament to bury the 
baptized into Christ’s death, that is, to secure for him the benefits 
of Christ’s vicarious death. While they insist upon the form, they 
reject the essential part of Baptism; they retain the shell, but 
discard the kernel. 

All objections to the divine institution of Holy Baptism have 
their source in man’s conceited, unbelieving reason, which wilfully 
sets aside Holy Scripture as the only source and rule of faith. 
When men declare that Baptism is superfluous — just as are all 
the means of grace — because only the “baptism of the Spirit and 
fire” is required (Quakers); or because it is a “Jewish ceremony” 
(Salvation Army); or because Baptism is a mere church rite

(Modernists; rationalistic theologians); or because it was meant 
only for the primitive Church (Socinians); or because the Trini¬ 
tarian formula of Matt. 28,19 is an interpolation, since the concept 
of the Trinity, as expressed in this passage, was foreign to the mind 
of the primitive Church (modernistic theologians; cp. 2 Cor. 
13,14; Titus 3,4—7; 1 Pet. 1,10—12); or because the account 
of St. Matthew is unhistorical, since Christ did not rise from the 
dead; or because, in view of 1 Cor. 1,14; John 3,22; 4,2, the 
passage Matt. 28,19 cannot be regarded as a baptismal command 
issued by Christ, they prove that they wilfully set themselves against 
Holy Scripture and exalt their blind reason above the Word of God. 

2. WHAT MAKES BAPTISM A SACRAMENT. 

(De Forma Baptism!) 

In order that there may be a valid baptism, there must be 
application of water to an individual; for water and its application 
are essential elements of this sacred ordinance. But water alone 
does not make Baptism a Sacrament. As Luther rightly says in 
his Catechism: “Baptism is not simple water only, but it is the 
water comprehended in God’s command and connected with God’s 
word.” St. Augustine expresses the same truth in the words: 
“When the Word is connected with the element, then the act be¬ 
comes a Sacrament” (Accedit Verbum ad elementum et fit sacrar 
mentum); that is to say, the act becomes a Sacrament when it is 
performed according to Christ’s institution. While the applica¬ 
tion of water is important, it is really the word of Christ connected 
with the application that makes Baptism “a washing of regenera¬ 
tion and renewing of the Holy Ghost.” 

The nature of this word of Christ is twofold. In the first 
place, it is a command (Matt. 28,19 [lit.] : “Going therefore, dis¬ 
ciple all the nations [make disciples of all the nations], baptizing 
them”). As the apostles were to go, so they were to make disciples 
by baptizing. The command to baptize is therefore very clear. 

In the second place, the divine word connected with Baptism 
is a promise (Matt. 28,19: “into the name felg to dvofia] of the 
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost”). What these words 
express is that Baptism is not an empty ceremony, but an efficacious 
means of grace, by which the baptized enters (through faith, of 
course, and not merely ex opere operato ) into communion with 
the Triune God. The words therefore are a most gracious promise 
and as such explain why the apostles could “make disciples by 
baptizing.” 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTI8M. 


489 


The baptismal promise is stated more clearly in Mark 16,16 
as follows: “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." 
In Rom. 6, 4 the promise is put still more definitely: “We are 
buried with Christ by Baptism into death” (sc. Christ’s death). In 
Gal. 3, 27 St. Paul declares that they who have been baptized into 
Christ have put on Christ, namely. His righteousness and merits 
(justification). 

Baptism is therefore correctly defined as water comprehended 
in God’s command and connected with God’s promise of forgive¬ 
ness of sins, life, and salvation. 

It has been pointed out (Tertullian, De Bapt., c. 6) that some 
heathen religions had their own established baptisms (Sacris 
quibusdam [nationes exterae ] per lavacrum initiantur Isidis ali- 
cuius out Mithrae). These baptisms were man-made and therefore 


' inefficacious; but Christ, the omnipotent, omniscient Lord, estab- 


^ lished by His divine command that true Baptism (a divine means 
" • ^ of grace) through which the baptized enters into communion with 
the true God and all His spiritual blessings of grace and forgiveness 
^Jixa&agiopd f, loxngov nahyyeveotae xal dvaxaivtooetos nvevpaxot 
^dylov, Titus 3, 5f.). 

Since Christ commanded His holy apostles and thus the entire $ 
^Christian Church to baptize “in jhe^name of the Father and of ^ ^ 
u, the Son and of the Holy Ghost,” this form of Baptism (Tauf- J 
formel) must be employed by the Christian believers whenever « ; 




they administer the holy Sacrament. This is not disproved by the 
r ^ fact that Scripture sometimes speaks of Baptism as performed “in” % 


3 


or “into the name of Christ” (Acts 2, 38: ini xq> ovopaxi ’Iyoov 
Xgioxov; 8,16 : ek to Svo/xa xvgiov ’Irjoov', 10, 48 : iv iw ovopaxi^ 


^ , - 7 - -- , - t --/-' “-7-- -T- - -fr— 

’Iqoov Xgioxov; Gal. 3, 27 : ek Xgiozdv; Kom. 6, 3: ek xov Xgioxov). * 


The baptism “by authority of,” or “into the name of,” Christ 
does not stand in opposition to the baptism into the name of the 


Triune God, since, on the one hand, Christ instituted the Sacra- 
^ ment, and, on the other, those who are baptized enter into com- 
5^ munion with the Triune God only through faith in Christ. The 
^ two series of passages are therefore not exclusive, but inclusive; 
that is to say, he who is baptized is baptized by Christ’s command 
into the Triune God through Christ Himself. In other words, we 
must never separate Baptism from Christ; it exists only because 
Christ commanded it, and it is efficacious only because it rests on 
His vicarious atonement, by which He secured all the spiritual 
blessings that are offered in Baptism.

THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM. 


This is the clear doctrine of St. Paul, who writes: "Christ also 
loved the Church and gave Himself for it that He might sanctify 
and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,” Eph. 5, 
25. 26. Baptism is therefore a sanctifying and cleansing water by 
[ 7 virtue of the word (Gospel) connected with it, in which Christ 
freely offers to all men the merits which He secured when "He gave 
<5 Himself” into death for the sins of the whole world. Every true 
o t baptism consequently is always in relation to Christ and because 
<^of this also in relation to the Holy Trinity. 

Zoeckler, in his commentary on Acts 2, 38, rightly remarks 
that the apostles, when baptizing "in the name of Jesus,” no 
doubt used the form prescribed in Matt. 28,19, quoting in this con- 
C''nection the Aidaxg (7, 2. 3). This was in full accord with their 
^ constant insistence on the Triune God as the only true and living 
God and the Source and Author of all spiritual blessings, 2 Cor. 
» 13,14; Eph. 1,2—14; 1 Pet. 1, 2-^4. 

n It is immaterial whether the minister uses the formula “I bap- 
i tize thee in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost” (Lu- 
J^.therans, Roman Catholics) or the one employed by the Greek Cath- 
olic Church: "This servant is baptized in the name of the Father, 
^4 Son, and Holy Ghost.” Even such a formula as “I baptize thee 
1 1 in the name of the Holy Trinity” is valid. But it must be borne 
in mind that the most fitting formula is that which comes closest 
\ to the words o f institution. No minister should change the for¬ 
mula established in the Church, since deviations are bound to cause 
doubt and arouse disputation. 


The question as to how we must regard baptismal acts per¬ 
formed by anti-Trinitarian heretics "in the name of the Father and 
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost” has been clearly and unani¬ 
mously answered by all Christian teachers. Already St. Augustine 
reports that at his time heretics frequently baptized in the name 
of the Triune God, but that such a baptism was not recognized 
as valid by the Church. 


Rejecting such a baptism is done on Scriptural grounds; for 
while it is true that in this case the name of the Holy Trinity is 
used, it is also true that such a use of God’s name is only mockery 
and blasphemy, since these heretics do not believe in the God whose 
name they employ. Our dogmaticians therefore rightly contend 
that in all these cases God’s Word is lacking, so that there is 
a “baptism” without the Word of God, and consequently no true 
baptism. 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM. 


491 


This case, of course, differs from one where an unbelieving 
minister (a hypocrite) serves a Christian congregation; in that 
case his personal unbelief does not invalidate Baptism, since he, 
when administering Baptism, serves as the representative of the 
Christian Church. 

It goes without saying that every baptism should be absolutely 
certain, so that the baptized may truly comfort himself with the 
covenant of grace established in Holy Baptism. In all cases of 
uncertainty the person in question must therefore be baptized. But 
this is not to be regarded as a second baptism or as a repetition of 
baptism, since an uncertain baptism is really no baptism. In con¬ 
clusion we may say that we accept as valid all acts of baptism 
performed within and by professed Christian congregations. 

3. BAPTISM A TRUE MEANS OF GRACE. 

Baptism, according to Scripture, is not a mere ceremony or 
church rite, but a true means of grace (aqua divino mandato com- 
prehensa et Verbo Dei obsignata), by which God offers and conveys 
to men the merits which Christ secured for the world by His 
vicarious satisfaction, Acts 2, 38. Luther in his Catechism there¬ 
fore says: “Baptism works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death 
and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, 
as the words and promises of God declare.” (Mark 16, 15. 16.) 
Very aptly our dogmaticians have called Baptism “a means of 
justification” (medium iustificationis sive remissionis peccatorum), 
which belongs into the Gospel, not into the Law. That is to say, 
Baptism does not save as a work which we perform unto God 
(not as the fulfilment of an obligation), but rather as a work of 
God in which He deals with and blesses us. “There is here no 
work done by us, but a treasure which He gives us." (Luther, 
Triglot, p. 741.) 

Baptism bestows nothing else than what also the Gospel offers 
and imparts; it works forgiveness of sins, Acts 2, 38, washes away 
sin, Acts 22,16, sanctifies and cleanses, Eph. 5, 26, regenerates and 
saves, Titus 3, 5; 1 Pet. 3, 21, etc. Moreover, what the Holy 
Spirit does through the Gospel, working and strengthening faith, 
Rom. 1, 16; 1 Cor. 2, 4, He does also through Baptism, 1 Pet. 
1, 23; Titus 3, 5. In fact, Baptism confers all divine spiritual 
blessings just because it is water connected with the Gospel 
promises of grace and salvation. As these divine promises are 
efficacious whenever they are heard or read, so they are efficacious 



492 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM. 


also when they are applied in Baptism. “By the Word such power 
is imparted to Baptism that it is a layer of regeneration.” (Luther, 
Triglot, p. 739.) 

The distinctive difference between Baptism and the Gospel in 
general is this, that God’s individual offer of grace in Holy Bap¬ 
tism through its application by water to the individual person be¬ 
comes the visible Word (Verbum visibUe). The Apology (Art. 
XIII [VII], 6) rightly remarks: “Just as the Word enters the 
ear in order to strike our heart, so the rite itself strikes the eye 
in order to move the heart. The effect of the Word and of the 
rite is the same, as it has been well said by Augustine that a Sacra¬ 
ment is a visible word, because the rite is received by the eyes and 
is, as it were, a picture of the Word, signifying the same thing as 
the Word. Therefore the effect is the same.” 

The truth just stated must be maintained against both Ro¬ 
manists and Calvinists. The papists indeed teach that through 
Baptism grace is bestowed upon the baptized (gratia infusa), but 
they err in claiming that this occurs ex opere operato, that is, 
without faith on the part of the person who is baptized. Against 
this error the Apology testifies (XIII [VII], 18 ff.): “This is 
absolutely a Jewish opinion, to hold that we are justified by a cere¬ 
mony, without a good disposition of the heart, t. e., without 
faith. . . . We teach that in the use of the Sacraments faith ought 
to be added, which should believe these promises and receive the 
promised things there offered in the Sacrament. The promise is 
useless unless it is received by faith.” 

The Council of Trent (Sess. VII, Can. 8) expressly anathema¬ 
tizes the Scriptural doctrine (Rom. 4,11) that divine grace offered 
in the Sacraments is received only by faith. The Church of Anti¬ 
christ therefore makes it impossible for its followers to obtain grace, 
since Holy Scripture teaches that faith is the only effectual means 
by which forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation can be secured, 
Mark 16,15.16; Rom. 4, 20—25. Its doctrine of Baptism is de¬ 
signed not to confer grace, but to deprive the sinner of grace; not 
to comfort him, but to impress upon him the monstrum incerti- 
tudinis gratiae. 

The Church of Rome pretends to be the true defender of 
Christian Baptism, but in reality it despises and invalidates it. 
According to Roman Catholic doctrine, Baptism completely destroys 
original sin, so that the remaining evil lust in the flesh (concur 
piscentia vel fomes) is no longer sin, a doctrine which is entirely 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM. 


493 


opposed to Scripture, Eom. 7,17—30. But to this error Romanism 
adds another, namely, that those who through mortal sins have 
fallen from grace may return to it, not indeed by faith in the 
baptismal promises, but by means of the “second board,” namely, 
through penance, or the performance of contritio cordis, confessio 
oris, satisfactio operis. The Roman Catholic doctrine of Baptism 
is therefore designed from beginning to end to support the papistic 
doctrine of salvation by works. 

In agreement with the Romanists are all Romanizing Protes¬ 
tants who claim that Baptism indeed works regeneration, but with¬ 
out actually kindling faith. They thus regard baptismal grace as 
conferred without a receiving means on the part of man, whereas 
Scripture teaches very clearly that there can be no regeneration 
without faith in the forgiveness of sins secured by Christ, John 
1,13.13; 3,5.14.15; 1 John 5,1, and offered and conveyed to 
men by the means of grace. The Lutheran Church, on the other 
hand, teaches correctly that Baptism is a means of regeneration 
for the reason that it offers and conveys forgiveness of sins and 
works and strengthens faith through its gracious Gospel offer. All 
(Romanists and Romanizing Protestants) who deny that Baptism 
is primo loco a means of justification by faith in the proffered 
grace intermingle Law and Gospel by making Baptism a means 
of sanctification, not by faith, but by works. 

The Scriptural doctrine concerning the efficacy (efficacia, 
virtus) of Baptism is rejected in toto by the Reformed. According 
to the Zwinglian view, Baptism is not a means (vehiculum), but 
only a symbol of forgiveness and regeneration (factae gratiae 
signum), the Holy Ghost working regeneration in man by imme¬ 
diate operation. (“Efficacious grace acts immediately.”) " Non 
affert gratiam baptismus (Zwingli, Fidei Ratio, Niemeyer, 
p. 35.) 

Water, according to the Calvinistic doctrine, simply cannot 
do such great things. (Boehl: “Das Wasser harm solche hohe 
Dinge nicht tun.” Dogmatik, p. 560.) This Luther admits to be 
true when he writes: “It is not the water indeed that does them.” 
But then follows his classic explanation: “[It is not the water 
indeed that does them,] but the word of God [the conferring 
means] which is in and with the water, and faith [the receiving 
means], which trusts such word of God in the water. For without 
the word of God the water is simple water and no Baptism. But 
■with the word of God it is a Baptism, that is, a gracious water 



494 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM. 


of life and a washing of regeneration in the Holy Ghost, as 
St. Paul says, Titus, chapter third.” 

According to Luther, Baptism therefore “works forgiveness 
of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salva¬ 
tion to all who believes this,” just because the words and promises 
of God in Baptism so declare or because Baptism is not simple 
water only, but water comprehended in God’s command and con¬ 
nected with God’s word (promise). 

Luther thus makes the efficacy of Baptism depend entirely on 
the Gospel promises which are connected with the water, Matt. 
28,19; Mark 16,15.16; Acts 2,38; for on these promises the 
faith of the baptized rests. “Faith must have something upon 
which it stands and rests.” (Luther, Triglot, p. 739.) 

Zwingli’s denial of the efficacy of Baptism was the result of 
his refusal to believe the promises which God has joined to the 
Sacrament. While Luther said that he would with joy and thanks¬ 
giving pick up a blade of straw if God had connected with this 
act such promises as are given in Baptism (St. L., XVI, 2296), 
Zwingli persistently repeated his rationalistic argument that “water 
cannot do such great things” and that he “never read in Scripture 
that the Sacraments offer and distribute grace” (Fidei Ratio, 
Niemeyer, pp. 24. 25), though he certainly knew such clear 
passages as Acts 2, 38; 22, 16; Eph. 5, 26; Titus 3, 5; etc. 
Luther was a true theologian, loyal to Scripture (Schrifttheolog), 
while Zwingli, just like his followers (Boehl, etc.), argued away 
the efficacy of Baptism on rationalistic grounds. 

As the Reformed deny that Baptism is a means of regeneration 
(initiationis et regenerations sacramentum), so they also deny that 
it is a means by which a person is joined to the spiritual body of 
Christ, namely, the Church, 1 Cor. 12,13, and by which the sanc¬ 
tification of the regenerate, namely, the crucifying of the old man 
and the raising up of the new man, is effected, Rom. 6, 1—11. 
According to the Reformed view these things are only symbolized 
by Baptism. Zwinglianism (Calvinism), as said before, is there¬ 
fore a denial of the efficacy of Baptism in toto. Every blessing 
which Scripture ascribes to this Sacrament is consistently denied 
on the strength of the rationalistic axiom: “Water cannot do such 
great things; it is the Spirit who must accomplish them.” 

From the rationalistic viewpoint this rejection of the efficacy 
of Baptism by the Reformed is quite intelligible. As Calvinism 
acknowledges no means of grace whatever in the Scriptural sense 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM. 


495 


(“Efficacious grace acts immediately”; “Nothing intervenes be¬ 
tween the volition of the Spirit and the regeneration of the soul”), 
so it also rejects the special means of grace known as the Sacrament 
of Baptism. 

Baptism is a medium remissions peccatorum et regenerations 
also in the case of adults who have already been regenerated through 
the Gospel. Our dogmaticians declare that such “adults receive 
an increase of those gifts by Baptism” (Gerhard), since they are 
confirmed and kept in their faith through the baptismal confirma¬ 
tion of the Gospel-promise. Baptism, like the Gospel itself, the 
seed of regeneration, 1 Pet. 1, 23, engenders faith not only at con¬ 
version, but continuously, Eom. 10,17. 

All other blessings of Holy Baptism, such as sanctification, or 
the continued renewing begun in Baptism, Titus 3, 5, the cruci¬ 
fying of the old man, the revival of the new man, Eom. 6, 
3—6, etc., result from the justification and regeneration which it 
works. So also the implanting into the body of Christ, which is 
effected by Baptism, 1 Cor. 12,13, is the necessary concomitant of 
its imparting of faith and the working of forgiveness of sins. 
Luther writes: “Therefore, if you live in repentance, you walk in 
Baptism, which not only signifies such a new life, but also produces, 
begins, and exercises it. For therein are given grace, the Spirit, 
and the power to suppress the old man, so that the new man may 
come forth and become strong.” ( Large Catechism, De Bap- 
tismo, 75.) It is Baptism therefore that enables us to keep our 
baptismal vow. 

In connection with Baptism, Lutheran dogmaticians have dis¬ 
cussed also the question whether a materia coelestis (a heavenly 
element) may be said to exist in this Sacrament, just as in the 
Lord’s Supper the materia coelestis is the body and blood of Christ. 
While some (Gerhard, Calov, Quenstedt) affirmed the question 
(“The materia coelestis in Baptism is the word of God, the Holy 
Spirit, Christ’s blood, the Holy Trinity,” etc.), others (Baier, etc.) 
suggested that it is better not to speak of a materia coelestis in 
Baptism, especially since the Holy Ghost, the word, the Holy 
Trinity, etc., may be called a materia coelestis not in a strict 
(stride loquendo), but only in a wider sense (Hollaz). The point 
is well taken; for in Baptism there is, properly speaking, no 
celestial element that corresponds to the body and blood of our 
Lord in the Holy Supper. 

Between the word and the water in Baptism there exists so

intimate a union that we must not distinguish between a baptismus 
intemus et externus. “There is but one Baptism and one washing.” 
{Saxon Visitation Articles; Triglot, p. 1153.) Cp. also [We reject 
the false and erroneous doctrine of the Calvinists] “that Baptism 
is an outward washing of water, whereby an inner washing [ablu¬ 
tion] from sins is only signified.” {Triglot, p. 1155.) 

4. THE USE OF BAPTISM. 

While the Lord’s Supper should be used frequently by the 
believer, 1 Cor. 11, 26, Scripture nowhere commands that Baptism 
should be applied to one and the same person oftener than once. 
On the contrary, Baptism, once applied, should comfort and exhort 
the believer throughout his life, 1 Pet. 3, 21; Gal. 3,26. 27; Bom. 
6, 3ff. For this reason the apostles in the New Testament again 
and again remind Christians of their Baptism, 1 Cor. 1,13; 6,11; 
12, 13; Bom. 6, 3ff.; Eph. 4, 5; Col. 2, 11. 12; Titus 3, 5. 6; 
1 Pet. 3, 21; etc., and urge them to heed not only its sweet comfort, 
but also its great significance for sanctification. Baptismus semper 
exercendus est. {Large Catechism, De Baptismo, 65.) 

The daily repentance of the Christian believer (poenitentia 
stantium) is nothing else than a constant penitent return to the 
covenant of grace which God has established with him in Baptism, 
or the continuous apprehension by faith of the gracious promises 
of forgiveness, life, and salvation offered and conveyed to him in 
this precious Sacrament. So also the repentance of the apostates 
from the Christian faith (poenitentia lapsorum) is only a return 
to their baptism (reditus ad baptismum), not their laying hold of 
the “second board” (secunda tabula) of the papistic penance (satis- 
factio operis). This truth the Christian minister must always in¬ 
culcate upon his hearers, especially when he is called upon to in¬ 
struct and confirm catechumens. 

Confirmation is not “a confirmation of Baptism” nor “a Sacra¬ 
ment which supplements and perfects Baptism,” but only a public 
profession of loyalty to the true God, who in Baptism establishes 
His covenant of grace with men. It is the believer’s public reply 
to his baptism, or his public confession of Christ, who has cleansed 
him in Baptism, Eph. 5, 26; Matt. 10, 32. Confirmation, of course, 
was not instituted by Christ; yet we retain it as a laudable, useful 
Christian custom (though not as a Sacrament), because it so vividly 
reminds the believer of His baptism and the exceeding grace which 
God conferred on him in that priceless Sacrament.

5. WHOM THE CHURCH SHOULD BAPTIZE. 

(Obiectum Baptismi.) 

Holy Scripture teaches that both adults and children should 
be baptized. With respect to adults, Scripture expressly points out 
that only such should be baptized as believe in, and confess, Christ, 
Acts 2,41; 8, 36—38. Children are to be baptized if they are 
brought to us for baptism either by their parents or by such as 
have parental authority over them, Mark 10, 13—16. The Lu¬ 
theran Church has always condemned the unscriptural papistic 
practise of baptizing children without the knowledge or against 
the will of the parents (baptism in secret). We therefore baptize 
only such children as are offered for baptism by those who have 
parental authority over them. 

That infants should be baptized is a clear doctrine of Scrip- 
ture (cp. Mark 10,13—16 with Col. 2,11.12). We may outline 
■ the Scripture evidence for infant baptism as follows: a) Infants 
^ are flesh born of flesh and as such are lost in sin, Ps. 51, 5; John 
3, 5. 6. b) It is God’s will that also infants should be regenerated 
^Sand saved, Mark 10,13—16, by their being brought to Christ, Luke 
z,'- 18,15—17. c) The means by which infants are brought to Christ 
is Baptism, Titus 3, 5. 6; 1 Pet. 3, 21; Col. 2, 11. 12. Hence 
infants are to be baptized. cr *7 

Scripture expressly records that in the primitive Christian 
Church believers were baptized “with their whole house,” 1 Cor. 
1, 16; Acts 11, 14; 16, 15. 33. All those who deny that this 
included infants must furnish the evidence for their contention. 

To the objection that infant baptism is not mentioned in the 
Bible and that hence it was not practised in apostolic times we 
rejoin that this argument does not apply, since infant baptism may 
r not have been mentioned just because it was so self-evident. 

From Col. 2,11.12 we know that Baptism in the New Testa¬ 
ment took the place of Circumcision, a Sacrament which was ad- 
^ ministered to male infants on the eighth day. This fact alone 
^ argues for pedobaptism, especially since our Lord commanded His 
$ apostles to baptize, and thus make disciples of, all nations (navxa 
xa Effor}), an expression which ordinarily includes children. 

In short, both directly and indirectly Scripture inculcates 
infant baptism, so that the Christian Church need not be troubled 
^-.on this point by the groundless objections of enthusiasts and 
fanatics, who base their opposition to pedobaptism chiefly on the 
supposition that infants cannot believe.

THE DOCTRINE OF HQLY BAPTISM.

Scripture declares expressly that little children Jean believe. 
Matt. 18, 2—6; Mark 10,13—16; Luke 18,15—17; 1 John 2,13. 
Nor is their faith a mere “potential faith” (potentia credendi), but 
actual faith (fides aciualis), or direct faith, which truly apprehends 
the promises offered in Baptism. 

If the objection is raised that it is impossible for us to conceive 
of direct faith in infants, we reply that it is also impossible for us 
to conceive of a direct faith in adults while they are asleep or in 
a coma. The question, however, is not whether we can comprehend 
the mysteries of faith by reason, but whether they are actually 
taught in Scripture. 

With respect to infant baptism it is proved by history that 
its practise was general in the second century. Origen (in Epist. 
ad Rom. V: “Ecclesia ab apostolis traditionem accepit etiam par- 
vulis baptismum dare ") quotes it as a general custom, while Ter- 
tullian, though disapproving of it himself on heretical grounds, 
testifies to its universal prevalence. 

With regard to infants of Christian believers who die without 
Baptism, it is best to commend them to God’s infinite mercy, who 
has power to work faith also without the ordained means of grace 
(Luke 1,44, cp. with Luke 1,15; cp. also the female infants in the 
Old Testament, who were not circumcised). With respect to the 
infants of unbelievers and heathen we dare not affirm that they are 
saved, Eph. 2,12. Here rather we confront the unsearchable judg¬ 
ments of God, Rom. 11, 33, concerning which the Formula of Con¬ 
cord warns us “that we should not reason in our thoughts, draw 
conclusions, nor inquire curiously into these matters.” ( Trigl 

p. 1081.) 

The christening of all res inanimatae (bells, ships) is a 
mockery of Holy Baptism and ought to receive the emphatic dis¬ 
approval of all earnest Christians. 

From 1 Cor. 15, 29 it cannot be argued that Baptism may take 
place for the benefit of such as have died without this Sacrament 
(Mormons). The Greek preposition vneg in this passage has no 
doubt a local, not a vicarious, signification. While “baptism for 
the dead” was practised by some heretics, church history records 
no instance where this was in use within the ancient Christian 
Church. We therefore reject the practise as unchristian. That 
the just shall live by his faith and not by that of another is a clear 
doctrine of Scripture, Mark 16,16; John 3,15—18, and in itself 
a conclusive argument against this heretical practise.

6. THE ADMINISTRANTS OF BAPTISM. 

(Causa Ministerialls Baptism!.) 

As all spiritual blessings which Christ has secured by His 
vicarious death belong to all believers, 1 Cor. 3, 21. 22, directly and 
immediately (that is, without the mediation of a clerical estate), 
so also Baptism. For this reason the question as to who should 
administer the Sacrament of Baptism (administrants of Baptism) 
becomes very simple. In the absence of called and ordained pastors 
every Christian believer has not only the privilege, but also the 
duty to baptize (emergency baptism; lay baptism). In organized 
Christian congregations the called and ordained pastors administer 
the Sacrament by virtue of their office in the name of the believers 
who called them. 

The Calvinists, who discountenance baptism by laymen, espe¬ 
cially by women, claiming that only ordained ministers can rightly 
administer the Sacrament, go beyond, indeed against, Scripture, 
1 Cor. 3, 21. The real reason why they take this stand is that 
they erroneously believe Baptism is not necessary, since salvation 
does not depend upon “water baptism,” but upon the grace of elec¬ 
tion and of the divine covenant. (Cf. Alting, Syllabus Controver- 
siarum etc., p. 263; cp. Pieper, Christl. Dogmatik, III, p. 328.) 
Their argument that laymen, by baptizing, presume to exercise the 
functions of the public ministry is only a pretext; what motivates 
their objection to lay baptisms is really their repudiation of the 
means of grace. Their claim is that baptismal acts performed by 
laymen have no efficacy (Baptismi nullam vim esse). But actually, 
according to their principle, by which they reject the means of 
grace. Baptism is not efficacious under any circumstances, since it 
does not effect regeneration, but only symbolizes it. 

7. THE NECESSITY OF BAPTISM. 

While Baptism is no adiaphoron, but a divine institution and 
ordinance, we must not regard it as absolutely necessary in the 
sense that no one can obtain forgiveness of sins and be saved who 
has not received this Sacrament. “Necessitas baptismi non est 
absoluta.” The reason for this is that already the preaching of 
the Gospel offers divine grace with forgiveness of sins, life, and 
salvation so completely and perfectly that any one who believes 
its promises is in possession of all spiritual blessings. 

This truth Luther and all Lutheran dogmaticians consistently 
maintained against the papistic theologians, who endeavored to 



600 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT BAPTISM. 


prove the absolute necessity of baptism, though they modified their 
doctrine somewhat by teaching that all infants that die without 
baptism suffer only negatively ( poena damni, i. e., they do not 
behold God), not positively ( poena sensus, i. e., they do not expe¬ 
rience the torments of the damned). Hodge’s claim that also the 
Lutheran theologians teach the absolute necessity of baptism (Out¬ 
lines, p. 502) ignores the fact that it is true Lutheran doctrine that 
"not the lack, but only the contempt of Baptism damns” (Con- 
iemptus sacramenti damnat, non privatio). 

While the confessional Lutheran Church has always empha¬ 
sized the absolute necessity of faith in the forgiveness of sins for 
Christ’s sake (sola fide), it has never taught the absolute necessity 
of baptism. To those who try to prove the absolute necessity of 
baptism from John 3, 5 we reply that Christ here rebuked the 
pharisaic contempt for Baptism; for of the Pharisees and lawyers 
we are told expressly that they "rejected the counsel of God against 
themselves, being not baptized of him,” John the Baptist, while 
of "all the people and the publicans” the holy writers declare that 
they “justified God” (i. e., acknowledged God’s counsel of salva¬ 
tion), "being baptized with the baptism of John,” Luke 7,29. 30. 
As Christ, so also we must insist upon the necessity of baptism 
(necessitas praecepti; necessitas medii) over against all who despise 
this holy Sacrament, repeating the words of our Lord: "Except ye 
be born again of water and of the Spirit, ye cannot enter into 
the kingdom of God.” This emphatic preaching of the divine Law 
must not be weakened under any circumstances where the pastor 
deals with such as show contempt for Baptism. 

8. REGARDING BAPTISMAL CUSTOMS. 

Every baptismal act is valid in which water is applied to 
a person in the name of the Triune God. However, in the course 
of time many customs and ceremonies have attached themselves 
to this important Sacrament. These Gerhard ( Locus de Baptismo, 
§§ 258—269) divides into three classes, namely, a) such as are 
based upon the divine command; b) such as were established by 
the apostles; and c) such as were added later. 

However, when we speak of baptismal customs and ceremonies, 
we ought to exclude all acts commanded by God (the application 
of water in the name of the Triune God) and consider only the 
usages which were developed in the course of time within the 
Church. What God has established by divine command does not 
lie on the same level as that which has been added by men. 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT BAPTISM. 


501 


According to Dr. C. F. W. Walther ( Pastorale, p. 130ff.), the 
recognized customs and ceremonies of Baptism are the following: 
a) the reference to original sin; b) the giving of the name; c) the 
so-called "small exorcism”; d) the sign of the cross; e) a prayer 
and the benediction; f) the ‘large exorcism”; g) the reading of 
Mark 10,13—16; h) the laying on of hands; i) the Lord’s Prayer; 
j) the renunciation and the Apostles’ Creed; k) the use of spon¬ 
sors; 1) the covering of the child with the baptismal garment; 
m) the final blessing. All these usages are in themselves only res 
indifferentes (adiaphora), which may be employed or omitted 
without injury to the sacramental action; nevertheless, as the 
Formula of Concord aptly remarks (Epit., X, 5), “herein all 
frivolity and offense should be avoided, and especial care should 
be taken to exercise forbearance towards the weak in faith, 1 Cor. 
8, 9; Bom. 14,13.” 

The reference to original sin is important; for by directing 
attention to this sin, the necessity of Holy Baptism is pointed out. 
The giving of the name is both comforting and hortat ve; for, on 
the one hand, it reminds the baptized that, since God has estab¬ 
lished His covenant with him who is thus personally named, he 
may at the remembrance of his sins always comfort himself with 
the assurance of baptismal grace; and, on the other, that he must 
continually walk in the newness of life, which the washing of 
water by the word signifies, Bom. 6, 4. The exorcism has been 
quite generally discarded; wherever it is retained, care must be 
taken to show that it does not refer to any bodily obsession, but 
to the spiritual thraldom which Satan exercises over all men by 
nature, Eph. 2,2. 3. 

Since the use of sponsors often causes difficulties to the Chris¬ 
tian minister, it is well for him to give adequate instruction on 
this point in due time. It goes without saying that only fellow- 
believers can be asked to fulfil the sacred obligations of godparents 
( e. g., the Christian training of the child in case of the parents’ 
death), so that in Lutheran churches only fellow-Lutherans may 
serve as sponsors. Heterodox friends of the baptized may serve 
only as witnesses to the holy act of baptism. If such heterodox 
persons are professed enemies of the true faith, they ought not to 
be admitted even as witnesses; for they may afterwards hinder the 
baptized in his Christian faith, 1 Cor. 15, 33. If among those who 
have been asked to serve as sponsors there are none who may be 
admitted as godparents, the pastor, treating them all as mere 



502 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM. 


witnesses, must not obligate them to fulfil the duties of true Chris¬ 
tian sponsors. The Roman Catholic doctrine that the sponsors 
enter into a spiritual relationship with the baptized is not based 
upon Scripture, but upon anti-Scriptural tradition. 

The renunciation (abrenuntiatio Satanae) in connection with 
the Apostles’ Creed points out the effect of Holy Baptism; for 
through this means of grace the baptized is transplanted from the 
kingdom of Satan into that of Jesus Christ, our Lord, John 3, 5. 
The questions which are asked at this point are directed to the 
baptized, not to the sponsors, though these answer them in the 
name of the child; for whoever is baptized (including also infants) 
is baptized upon his own faith and not upon that of his sponsors 
or upon a potential future faith. 

This faith Baptism itself works as a means of regeneration, 
Titus 3, 5, through the Gospel, Rom. 1,16. 17, with which it is con¬ 
nected, Mark 16,15.16; for wherever the Gospel is proclaimed, 
there the Holy Spirit is present to work faith and regeneration, 
1 Cor. 2, 4. 5; Rom. 10,17; Jas. 1,18; 1 Pet. 1, 2—5. 

Scripture teaches very plainly that God’s grace, offered in the 
conferring means (media doxixd), is apprehended only through 
faith as the receiving means (medium Irjnxixdv), so that we must 
reject as a pernicious error any doctrine claiming that Baptism 
works ex opere operato. Acts 16, 31; Rom. 1, 16. 17, or with¬ 
out faith. 

That also infants (ra ftgiqpr]) can believe is clear from Jesus’ 
own words, Matt. 18, 6; Luke 18,15 ff.; 2 Tim. 3,15. 

Speaking of infant baptism in general, Luther rightly says 
(St. L., XI, 497) : “The baptism of infants, and the comfort we 
derive from it, rest upon the word: ‘Suffer little children to come 
unto Me and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.’ 
He has spoken this, and He does not lie. Hence it must be right 
and a Christian act to bring little children unto Him, which can 
be done in no other way than through Baptism. For this reason 
it must also be certain that He blesses them and that He gives the 
kingdom of heaven to all who come to Him in this way; for He 
adds: ‘Of such is the kingdom of God.’ ” 

Speaking more specifically of the faith of infants, Luther 
rightly argues that we can be more certain of the faith of infants 
than of that of adults because the latter may wilfully resist, which 
wilful resistance is not found in little children. (St. L., XI, 496f.) 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT BAPTISM. 


503 


If the objection is raised that it is rather strange to ask for 
a profession of the infant's faith and then to demand the answer 
from the sponsors, we reply that this is a public confession of our 
sincere belief that the child indeed has faith, though it is unable 
to make public profession of it. The confession is the more neces¬ 
sary since there are so many who deny that infants can have true 
faith, Matt. 18,6, though they claim to be believing Christians 
(Calvinists). 

To the suggestion that the questions “Do you believe in God 
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?” etc., should indeed be put to 
adults, but not to infants, we reply that the Church has not two 
kinds of Baptism (some sects: Children are “sprinkled,” while 
adults are “baptized,” i.e., immersed), but, as St. Paul declares, 
only one (Eph. 4, 5: “one Lord, one faith, one Baptism”). 
(Cp. St. L., XI, 490.) 

The question “At what time during the baptismal act is faith 
engendered in the child ?” need not give us much concern. So Lu¬ 
ther treats this query. His contention is that we bring little 
children to Baptism upon the command of our Lord, no matter 
whether they believe “either before or in baptism” (St. L., 
XI, 489). Since the divine command has been given, Mark 10, 
13—16; Luke 18, 15—17, we must bring our little children to 
Jesus and trust Him to bless them when and how He wills. 
(St. L., XI, 495.) 

However, since no human ceremony is properly a part of Bap¬ 
tism and therefore has no divine promise attached to it, it is cor¬ 
rect to say that faith is engendered in that moment when the 
water is applied to the infant in the name of the Triune God. 
If before this solemn act the question is put to the child, “Do 
you believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost ?” this is done 
by way of anticipation to emphasize the Scriptural truth and 
Christian confession that Baptism is indeed a medium iustifica- 
tionis , or the means of regeneration, by which faith is engendered. 

In conclusion we may remark that the Scriptural doctrine of 
infant faith is a test of a person’s faith in God’s Word. If at this 
point we consult reason, we shall deny that little children can 
believe and like the erring disciples rebuke those who bring infants 
to Jesus to have them baptized, Luke 18, 15. However, in that 
case Jesus “is much displeased” also with us and reprovingly com¬ 
mands us: “Suffer the little children to come unto Me and forbid 
them not; for of such is the kingdom of God,” Mark 10, 14. 



504 


THE DOCTRINE OF HOLT BAPTISM. 


Indeed, then He warns us, too, that we shall not enter the kingdom 
of God unless we receive it “as a little child/’ Mark 10,15. AIbo 
with respect to the faith of regenerate infants, Christ exhorts us: 
“Be not faithless, but believing. . . . Blessed are they that have 
not seen and yet have believed,” John 20,27—29. 

9. THE BAPTISM OF JOHN THE BAPTIST. 

Our Lutheran dogmaticians (Chemnitz, Gerhard, Aegidius 
Hunnius, etc.) have always identified the baptism of John with 
that of the Christian Church so far as its purpose and efficacy are 
concerned. Modern theologians have censured this “essential and 
complete identification” of the two (Thomasius, Dogmatik, IY, 10). 
However, our older dogmaticians based their teaching on firm 
Scriptural ground; for according to Scripture John’s Baptism was 
a true means of grace, possessing both the vis dativa and vis effec- 
iiva of Christian baptism. 

The holy evangelists tell us expressly that John preached the 
“Baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,” Mark 1, 4; 
Luke 3, 3, just as St. Peter on Pentecost, following the instruc¬ 
tions of our Lord, preached Baptism “for the remission of sins,” 
Acts 2, 38. For this reason John’s baptism must be regarded as 
identical with that which Christ instituted at a later time, as our 
older dogmaticians rightly affirmed. 

Since John the Baptist was the way-preparer for Christ and 
appeared in the name of the Lord, Luke 1, 76—79, his baptism was 
no less by divine command than was his preaching, John 1, 32—36; 
5, 33—35. Hence also John’s baptism was “water comprehended 
in God’s command and connected with God’s word” and as such 
a true means of grace. 

To-day the question is, of course, of no practical importance, 
since the baptism of John is no longer in use. But the early Chris¬ 
tian Church had to reckon with it, and Scripture records an in¬ 
stance where “certain disciples” who had been baptized “unto 
John’s baptism” were at St. Paul’s instigation ‘^baptized in the 
name of the Lord Jesus,” Acts 19,1—6. The reason why this was 
done is quite evident. While the baptism of John was a true 
Sacrament, it was valid only during the time of preparation, until 
Christ should appear and finish His work. After Pentecost there¬ 
fore the baptism of John no longer had any value, just as the Old 
Testament Sacrament of Circumcision, though still practised by 
the Jewish Christians, became a mere ceremony. (Kretzmann, 
Popular Commentary, Vol. 1, 630.) 



THE DOCTRINE OF HOLY BAPTISM. 


505 


Moreover, we may not be wrong in assuming that the "certain 
disciples” at Ephesus had not been baptized by John himself, but 
by some of his followers, who discarded their master’s command to 
join Jesus as "the Lamb of God,” John 1, 35—37; Matt. 9,14.15; 
Luke 5,33. The "disciples of John,” refusing to accept Jesus as 
the promised Savior, had therefore degenerated to a Judaistic sect, 
so that their baptism, properly speaking, was no longer "the bap¬ 
tism of John,” but a godless "opposition baptism.” (Acts 19,2: 
"We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost”; 
cp. with John 1,33: "The same is He which baptizeth with the 
Holy Ghost.”) John’s witness of Christ evidently was no longer 
known to them. 

There is yet another way of interpreting this passage, according 
to which Paul did not baptize these "certain disciples” at all, but 
merely laid his hands on them, whereupon they received the Holy 
Ghost. According to this interpretation, v. 5 gives the words of 
Paul, and not those of Luke, so that Paul here relates what the 
people did when they heard John the Baptist urging them to believe 
on Christ Jesus. In other words, when the people heard the preach¬ 
ing of John the Baptist concerning Christ, they were baptized in 
the name of the Lord Jesus, a fact which Paul here quotes to con¬ 
firm the baptism of John. This simple interpretation has much 
in its favor, though it is quite commonly rejected by modern 
exegetes. 

For the sake of completeness we may add that our older 
dogmaticians carefully distinguish the baptismus fiuminis, or the 
"water baptism,” which Christ instituted for the remission of sins. 
Matt. 28,19; Mark 16,15.16, from the baptismus flaminis, or the 
outpouring of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, Acts 1, 5, and from the 
baptismus sanguinis , or martyrdom. Matt. 20, 22. It is understood, 
of course, that only the first is a true Sacrament and that in all 
other cases the term baptism is employed in a wider, or figura¬ 
tive, sense.

THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 

(De Coena Sacra.) 


1. THE DIVINE INSTITUTION OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 

The Lord’s Supper is no less a divine institution and ordi¬ 
nance (institutio divina) than are Baptism, Matt. 28,19, and the 
preaching of the Gospel, Mark 16,15.16. The Holy Supper, which 
our Lord instituted in the same night in which He was betrayed, 
was to continue in use till the end of time (Luke 22, 19: “This 
do in remembrance of Me”; 1 Cor. 11, 25: “This do ye, as oft as 
ye drink it, in remembrance of Me”). So the holy apostles and 
the primitive Christian Church understood the divine command, 
1 Cor. 10, 16—22; 11, 17—34, and celebrated Holy Communion 
accordingly. 

The divine institution of the Lord’s Supper requires emphasis, 
since to-day certain enthusiasts (Quakers, the Salvation Army) 
reject the Holy Supper “as a mere ceremony not commanded by 
our Lord.” In doing this, these enthusiasts are thoroughly con¬ 
sistent. Inconsistent enthusiasts (Calvinists) repudiate only the 
oral reception of the body and blood of Christ in Holy Com¬ 
munion (manducatio oralis) on the ground that “the flesh profiteth 
nothing” (a misapplication of John 6, 63), while the Quakers reject 
the Sacrament altogether, on the ground that “the kingdom of God 
is not meat and drink” (a misapplication of Rom. 14,17) and that 
no man must judge the Christian “in meat or in drink” (a mis¬ 
application of Col. 2,16). 

According to Quakerian doctrine the true Lord’s Supper is 
eaten and drunk in the heart (a misapplication of Rev. 3, 20). 
Quakerism teaches, moreover, that Christ celebrated the first 
Supper only for the benefit of His “weak disciples,” so that this 
was meant for perpetuation as little as was “foot-washing,” John 
13, 5, or “the anointing of the sick with oil,” Jas. 5,14.15, or “the 
abstaining from blood and from things strangled,” Acts 15, 29. 
But the Quakers are not the only offenders in this respect. 

Modern rationalistic theologians (B. Weiss, Juelicher, Spitta) 
have endeavored to disprove the divine institution of the Lord’s 
Supper by arguments no more valid than are those which Quakerism 
employs (“Only Paul and Luke cite the words: ‘This do in re¬ 
membrance of Me,’” etc.). Cremer, on the contrary, rightly re¬ 
marks that no fact in the New Testament is better attested than 
is the divine ordinance of the Holy Supper (RE, 3 I, 33). 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


507 


In contradistinction to Holy Baptism, which is the sacra- 
mentum initiationis, or the Sacrament by which faith is engen¬ 
dered, the Lord’s Supper is the sacramentum confirmationis, that 
is, the Sacrament by which faith is strengthened. Gerhard: Per 
baptismum in foedus Dei recipimur; per usum sacrae coenae in 
eo conservamur. Per baptismum fides et reliqua Spiritus dona 
in nobis accendenturj per usum sacrae coenae augentur et con- 
firmantur. 

Baptism therefore rightly precedes Holy Communion. On 
Pentecost, St. Peter urged the penitent Jews to be baptized, but 
not to receive the Lord’s Supper, Acts 2. This fact is of great 
practical importance; for persons who desire to receive Holy Com¬ 
munion should first be baptized before they are admitted to the 
Lord’s Table. (Cp. Col. 2,11.12: Baptism in the New Testament 
has taken the place of Circumcision; and in the Old Testament 
only the circumcised were admitted to the Passover, Ex. 12, 48.) 

The names which are applied to this Sacrament are either 
given in Scripture directly (the breaking of bread, xidotg tov 
&qxov, Acts 2, 42; the Lord’s Supper, deinvov xvgtaxov, 1 Cor. 
11,20; the Lord’s Table, zganeCn xvgiov, 1 Cor. 10,21), or sug¬ 
gested by Scripture (Eucharist, ev/agtunjoac, Mark 14,23; Com¬ 
munion, 1 Cor. 10,16; Abendmahl or Nachtmahl, 1 Cor. 11,23). 
In the writings of the Church Fathers this Sacrament is also 
called “religious service” (ovra^ig), “love-feast” {dydnrj), “liturgy” 
(Xeuovgyia), “sacrifice” (frvata), “offering” (ngoocpogd), “mystery” 
(/ivozr/giov ), “thanksgiving” (evxagiozta, evloyta), etc., and in those 
of the Latin fathers “mass” (missa), coena Domini, sacramentum 
altaris, etc. 

As long as the names of the Sacrament are not used to express 
unscriptural doctrine, no controversy ought to be waged about 
them (cp. Luther, St. L., XX, 174ff.). Luther at times employed 
the name mass, though he expressly rejected the papistic doc¬ 
trine of the Mass, and he defended this use against his fanatic 
opponent Carlstadt. Modern German theologians (Holtzmann, 
Noesgen, etc.) frequently employ the term Herrenmahl, which is 
the equivalent of our English expression “Lord’s Supper.” 

2. THE RELATION OF THE LORD’S SUPPER TO THE 
OTHER MEANS OF GRACE. 

As the Gospel in its proper sense and Holy Baptism are means 
of justification and remission of sins (medium iustificationis sive 
remissionis peccatorum), so also is the Lord’s Supper. That is to 



508 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


say, the Lord’s Supper is not Law or a work which men perform 
for God, but pure Gospel, or a most gracious work, by which Christ 
deals with men, offering to all communicants the grace and merits 
which He obtained for the world by His death on the cross. The 
Lord’s Supper is therefore a true means of grace, by which the 
Holy Spirit assures all communicants that they have a gracious 
God, who freely forgives their sins for Christ’s sake. 

This truth is taught in the words of institution: “Take, eat; 
this is My body, which is given for you”; and: “Take, drink; 
this is My blood, which is shed for you.” Quite manifestly these 
words express the gracious Gospel-message that we need not atone 
for our sins, since Christ Himself has atoned for them by shedding 
His blood for us on the cross, and that we obtain full possession 
of these heavenly gifts by accepting in true faith the blessed Gospel 
offer which He makes to us in Holy Communion. 

Luther well says (St. L., XIX, 346): “The mass [the Lord’s 
Supper] is not a work or sacrifice [which men must render], but 
a word and sign of divine grace, which God employs on our behalf 
to establish and strengthen in us faith toward Him.” So also the 
Apology declares (Art. XXIV [XII]): “The Sacrament was insti¬ 
tuted for the purpose of being a seal and testimony of the free 
remission of sins, and accordingly it ought to admonish alarmed 
consciences to be truly confident and believe that their sins are 
freely remitted.” The Smdlcdld Articles similarly classify the 
Lord’s Supper among the means of grace, “by which the forgive¬ 
ness of sins is preached” (Part III, Art. IV). 

In common with Holy Baptism and private absolution (P rival - 
absolution) the Lord’s Supper offers forgiveness of sins, life, and 
salvation to sinners individually, so that the same grace which the 
Gospel proclaims to all is announced and offered personally to every 
one who attends the Lord’s Table. But the Lord’s Supper has one 
characteristic which is not found in any other means of grace. 
In this Sacrament Christ confirms and seals His gracious forgive¬ 
ness of sins by imparting His own body and blood, which the 
communicant receives in, with, and under the bread and wine, 
1 Cor. 10,6; 11,27—29. The Lord’s Supper thus has a true 
materia coelestis (the body and blood of Christ), which the Sacra¬ 
ment of Baptism has not, and through the gift of this “heavenly 
matter” Christ assures the communicant of the gracious forgive¬ 
ness of his sins. 

The Lord’s Supper is therefore a most salutary Sacrament, in 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER.

which every believer should greatly rejoice. But, alas! this 
precious Sacrament has been most shamefully perverted by men 
who exalted their conceited reason above the Word of God. The 
Romanists have not only mutilated it (sub una specie), but have 
also changed it from an efficacious means of grace to an anti- 
Scriptural “unbloody sacrifice” (transubstantiation; the papistic 
sacrifice of the Mass for the sins of the living and the dead; 
cp. Luther, St. L., XIX, 1303). The Calvinists (Zwinglians), on 
the other hand, denied the real presence of the body and blood of 
our Lord in the Holy Supper and blasphemously charged the Lu¬ 
therans, who maintained the true Scriptural doctrine concerning 
the realis praesentia, with cannibalism, Thyestean banqueting, and 
the like (cp. Formula of Concord, Thor. Decl., VII, 67: duos pilos 
caudae equinae et commentum, cuius vel ipsum Satanam pudeat; 
excrementum Satanae, quo diabolus sibi ipsi et hominibus illudat). 

Other errorists, also going beyond Scripture, ascribe to the 
Lord’s Supper a “physical” or “natural” operation (physische 
Wirkung, Naturwirkung) and thus turn the attention of Christians 
from the real purpose and function of the Holy Supper. It is the 
confutation of these errors that makes a more lengthy and detailed 
treatment of the doctrine of Holy Communion necessary. 

3. THE SCRIPTURAL DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 

The following three doctrines have been taught within Chris¬ 
tendom concerning the Lord’s Supper: — 

a. In the Holy Supper there is only body and blood of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, that is to say, in the Eucharist the bread and 
wine are changed (transubstantiated) into the body and blood of 
our Lord ( transubstantiation; established by the Lateran Council 
of 1215 as a dogma of the Roman Catholic Church and confirmed 
by the Council of Trent, Sess. XIII, Can. 2). 

b. In the Holy Supper the bread and wine are only symbols 
or bare signs of the absent body and blood of Christ ("Abesse 
Christi corpus et sanguinem a signis tanto intervallo dicimus, 
quanto abest terra ab altissimis coelisf’ ; cp. Formula of Concord, 
Thor. Decl., VII, 4. 5; also the Consensus Tigurinus, XXII, 
Niemeyer, p. 196, where the Lutheran doctrine is rejected as “pre¬ 
posterous”). 

c. In the Holy Supper a peculiar union (the sacramental 
union) occurs by virtue of Christ’s institution between the bread 
and the wine, on the one hand, and the body and blood of Christ, 



510 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


on the other, and because of this union all communicants (mandu~ 
catio generalis) receive in, with, and under the bread and wine in 
a supernatural, incomprehensible manner Christ’s true body and 
blood (manducatio oralis) as a pledge of the gracious remission of 
their sins. 

This union is neither personal, as is the union of the two 
natures in Christ, nor mystical (unio mystica), as is that between 
Christ and the believer, but sacramental, that is to say, the unio 
sacramentalis takes place only in the Holy Supper (praesentia 
sacramentalis) . It is neither natural nor local, but illocal, super¬ 
natural, and incomprehensible, yet real. 

This doctrine has always been maintained by confessional 
Lutheranism as the true doctrine of Scripture. It is set forth ip 
Luther’s Small Catechism: “The Sacrament of the Altar is the 
true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ under the bread and 
wine, for us Christians to eat and to drink, instituted by Christ 
Himself”; in the Augsburg Confession (Art. X) : “Of the Supper 
of the Lord they teach that the body and blood of Christ are truly 
present and are distributed to those who eat in the Supper of the 
Lord; and they reject those that teach otherwise”; in the Formula 
of Concord (Epit., VII, 6. 7): “We believe . . . that in the Holy 
Supper the body and blood of Christ are truly and essentially 
present and are truly distributed and received with the bread and 
wine. We believe . . . that the words of the testament of Christ 
are not to be understood otherwise than as they read, according 
to the letter, so that the bread does not signify the absent body 
and the wine the absent blood of Christ, but that on account of the 
sacramental union they [the bread and wine] are truly the body 
and blood of Christ.” 

If we compare the three tenets with Holy Scripture, we find 
that indeed only the Lutheran doctrine can be proved to be Scrip¬ 
tural. That transubstantiation does not occur in the Lord’s Supper 
is shown by St. Paul in 1 Cor. 11, 27; 1 Cor. 10,16, where he de¬ 
clares that the earthly elements (bread and wine) remain such 
even after the consecration. The contention of the Eomanists that 
only “the external appearance and taste” (visus et gusttis corpo- 
reus) of the earthly elements remain while their substance has 
disappeared is a “sophistical subtlety.” In 1 Cor. 10,16 and 1 Cor. 
11, 28 St. Paul declares the very opposite to be true; for he speaks 
of the consecrated bread as still being bread, etc. 

Luther is indeed right when he says ( Smalcald Articles, 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


511 


Part III, Art. VI) : “As regards transubstantiation, we care noth¬ 
ing about the sophistical subtlety by which they teach that bread 
and wine leave or lose their own natural substance and that there 
remain only the appearance and color of bread and not true bread. 
For it is in perfect agreement with Holy Scripture that there is 
and remains bread, as Paul himself calls it, 1 Cor. 10,16: ‘The 
bread which we break’; and 1 Cor. 11, 28: ‘So let him eat of that 
bread.’ ” 

Closely connected with the pernicious doctrine of transubstan¬ 
tiation are the papistic errors of the “sacrifice of the Mass,” by 
which Christ’s body “is continually offered up in an unbloody 
manner for the sins of the living and the dead,” of the “adoration 
of the host” (corpus Christi festivals; Eucharistic Congresses), and 
of sub una specie, that is, the prohibition of the cup to the laity 
(cp. the pernicious doctrine of concomitance: with the consecrated 
host the communicant receives both the body and blood of our 
Lord). For these three papistic errors not even a shred of proof 
is found in Holy Scripture; indeed, the Word of God is strictly 
opposed to them, Heb. 10,10—14; Matt. 26, 27; 1 Cor. 11, 24—26. 

The Reformed doctrine (“The body and blood are absent from 
the Lord’s Supper, but are received spiritually, or by faith”) is 
disproved by the words of institution, where Christ says distinctly: 
“Take, eat, this is My body; take, drink, this is My blood.” In 
other words, our Lord declares expressly of the bread which is 
eaten that it is His body and of the wine which is drunk that it 
is His blood. Chemnitz rightly affirms that, when Christ says: 
“Eat, drink,” He directly prescribes the way, or mode, of the re¬ 
ceiving (modus sumptionis), so that we indeed receive His body 
and blood with the mouth (oral reception; manducatio oralis). 

Chemnitz, of course, does not champion a “Capernaitic,” or 
natural, eating and drinking of the Lord’s body and blood; for 
he teaches distinctly that, while the bread and wine are received in 
a natural manner, the body and blood of our Lord are received in 
a supernatural, incomprehensible manner. According to the words 
of institution the reception of Christ’s body and blood with the 
mouth is true and real. 

The words of institution, it is true, demand also a spiritual 
eating or drinking, or faith in the words “Given and shed for you 
for the remission of sins.” This is proved directly by Christ’s com¬ 
mand : “This do in remembrance of Me.” But what the words of 
institution declare in particular is that “in, with, and under the 



512 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


bread and wine Christ presents His true body and blood to be truly 
and substantially eaten and drunk by us.” In other words, the 
words of institution say: " That which I offer you, which you are 
to receive and eat, is not only bread, but also My body. That which 
I offer you, which you are to receive and drink, is not only wine^ 
but also My blood" 

. The papistic doctrine makes of the bread a "sham bread” 
(Scheinbrot), teaching that the bread is transubstantiated into 
Christ’s body, while that of the Reformed makes of the body 
a "sham body,” claiming that the bread is only a symbol of Christ’s 
absent body. / The Lutheran doctrine, on the contrary, affirms that 
the bread remains real bread also after the consecration, but that 
Christ’s true body is substantially present in, with, and under the 
bread on account of the sacramental union. That is to say, Luther¬ 
anism accepts the words of institution as they read, or in their 
literal sense. It avers that our Lord, when instituting the Holy 
Supper, employed a mode of speech which is readily intelligible, 
namely, the so-called locutio exhibitiva, according to which only 
that object is named to which attention should be directed 
(synecdoche ) z 

Our Savior said: “This [the bread] is My body; this [the 
wine] is My blood,” directing the attention of the disciples not to 
that which was visible, namely, the bread and wine, but to that 
"which was exhibited through the medium of the bread and wine, 
namely, His body and blood.” This is proved also by the words 
which He added: “which is given” and "which is shed”; for they 
show that Christ, when instituting the Holy Supper, had in mind 
His real body and His real blood. 

Hollaz writes: “In the former proposition (‘This is My 
body’) the demonstrative pronoun this denotes the entire sacra¬ 
mental complex, consisting of bread and the body of Christ; in the 
latter proposition (‘This is My blood’) it likewise denotes the 
entire complex, consisting of . . . the wine and the blood of Christ, 
mysteriously united. Because the pronoun this is employed with 
regard to both the bread and the body, the Romish doctrine of 
transubstantiation is excluded. The substantive verb is connects 
the predicate with the subject and denotes that that which is offered 
in the Holy Supper is really and truly not only bread, but also 
the body of Christ.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 559. Cp. also Luther, 
St. L., XX, 1034 ff.) 

To the objection of the Reformed (Hodge, Syst. Theol., 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


513 


III, 662) that, "if the bread is literally the body of Christ, it is 
no longer bread; for no one asserts that the same thing can be 
bread and flesh (or body) at the same time,” we reply that this 
is a premise which not even the Calvinists concede. For although 
Scripture applies the same locutio exhibitiva to Christ (Luke 1, 35: 
"The Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the 
Son of God”), they nevertheless admit that Christ is not only true 
God, but also true man. (Cp. also Matt. 16,16.) For this reason 
their argument "If the words of Christ are to be taken literally, 
they teach the doctrine of transubstantiation” (Hodge) is unten¬ 
able. As the locutio exhibitiva in Luke 1, 35 does not exclude 
the existence of the true human nature in Christ, so the locutio 
exhibitiva in Matt. 26, 26—28 does not exclude the existence of 
true bread and wine in the Lord’s Supper. 

It has been pointed out that "the Reformed were not agreed 
among themselves” (Hodge). This well-known Reformed theo¬ 
logian says ( Syst. Theol., Ill, 626) that “there were three distinct 
types of doctrine among them, the Zwinglian, the Calvinistic, and 
an intermediate form, which ultimately became symbolical, being 
adopted in the authoritative standards of the Church.” But Shedd, 
another Calvinistic theologian, admits ( Dogtn . Theol., II, 569) 
that “the difference between Zwingli and Calvin upon sacramen- 
tarian points has been exaggerated.” 

In the final analysis all Reformed theologians were in full 
agreement with one another with respect to the “sacramentarian 
points.” Their difference related to expressions rather than to doc¬ 
trines; for they all held that Christ’s body has only a local and 
visible mode of presence (praesentia localis) and, since it is now 
locally included in heaven, cannot be really present in the Holy 
Supper. 

The Formula of Concord (Thor. Decl., VIII, 2) says: “When 
Dr. Luther . . . had maintained the true, essential presence of the 
body and blood of Christ in the Supper with solid arguments from 
the words of institution, the objection was urged against him by 
the Zwinglians that, if the body of Christ were present at the same 
time in heaven and on earth in the Holy Supper, it could be no 
real, true human body; for such majesty was said to be peculiar 
to God alone and the body of Christ not capable of it.” 

Calvin denied the real presence in the sense of the Lutheran 
teachers as much as did Zwingli, as also Hodge admits. Of this the 
Formula of Concord declares (Thor. Decl., VII, 5) : "Afterwards, 

CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 33 



514 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


when they were forced by Christ's words to confess that the body 
of Christ is present in the Supper, they still understood and de¬ 
clared it in no other way than spiritually, that is, of partaking 
through faith of His power, efficacy, and benefits, because, they say, 
through the Spirit of Christ, who is everywhere, our bodies, in 
which the Spirit of Christ dwells here upon earth, are united with 
the body of Christ, which is in heaven.” 

Calvin’s accommodation to the Lutheran terminology was done 
mainly in the interest of effecting a pan-Protestant union between 
the Reformed and the Lutherans. Dr. F. Bente is right when he 
says: “Calvin’s doctrine was nothing but a polished form of 
Zwingli’s crude teaching, couched in phrases approaching the Lu¬ 
theran terminology as closely as possible.” (Concordia Triglotta, 
Hist. Introd. XVIII, pp. 174ff.) 

However, while the Reformed agreed with respect to the doc¬ 
trine that Christ’s body is absent from the Holy Supper and is 
therefore received only spiritually by the believing communicant, 
they disagreed with regard to the interpretation of the words of 
institution. Carlstadt asserted that the word this does not refer to 
the bread, but to the body of the present Christ, who “pointed to 
His own body” while pronouncing the words of institution. 
(“I have always explained it thus that Christ pointed to His body 
when He said, ‘This is My body.’” St. L., XX, 2325.) 

Zwingli, on the other hand, explained the words of institution 
by taking the verb is in the sense of signify (significat), so that 
the meaning is: “This signifies or represents My body.” 

Calvin (Oecolampadius), again, sought the figure of speech 
in the words “My body,” explaining them as follows: “That which 
I give you is the sign of My body (signum corporis)." While 
Carlstadt’s explanation of the words of institution was soon rejected 
as absurd even by Reformed scholars (Schenkel), those of Zwingli 
and Calvin, though just as arbitrary, were generally accepted. 

Against Zwingli’s contention that the verb is means as much 
as signifies Krauth {Cons. Ref., p. 619) rightly declares: “Lan¬ 
guage itself would commit suicide if it could tolerate the idea that 
the substantive verb is shall express not substance, but symbol.” 
On this point compare also Luther, St. L., XX, 909 ff.; also Meyer 
on 1 Cor. 10, 16, who, though personally favoring the Reformed 
interpretation, nevertheless declares: "'Eoxi never means anything 
else than est; never does it mean significat; it is a copula, always 
expressing that which is (die Kopula d-es Seins).” 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


515 


The passages adduced by Zwingli in proof for his doctrine 
(John 10, 9; 15, 5; 1 Cor. 10, 4; Luke 8, 11; Matt. 13, 38; 
11,14; Gal. 4, 24) do not support his claim. When, for example, 
it is said that “Christ is the Door,” the verb is does not mean 
signify, but is; since in the realm of heavenly things Christ 
actually is what a door is in the realm of earthly things. In other 
words, as the door admits a person into a house, so Christ admits 
a person into heaven. Consequently the figure of speech (tropus) 
in the statements quoted is not to be sought in the verb is, but in 
the predicate noun (door, rock, vine, etc.). Luther is right when 
he says that no man can. ever prove that in a single Scripture- 
passage, indeed in all the languages of the world, is means as much 
as signifies (St. L., XX, 905ff.). 

Dr. Krauth writes very correctly (Cons. Ref., 618ff.): “A more 
dangerous falsity in interpretation than the assumption that the 
word is may be explained in the sense of signify or be a symbol of 
is hardly conceivable. Almost every doctrine of the Word of God 
will melt under it. ‘The Word was God’ would mean: ‘The Word 
signified, was a symbol of, God.’ ‘God is a spirit* would mean: 
‘God is a symbol of a spirit.* When it is said of Jesus Christ: 
‘This is the true God,’ it would mean that He is the symbol, or 
image, of the true God. By it Christ would cease to be the Way, 
the Truth, and the Life and would be a mere symbol of them. . . 

Creation, redemption, and sanctification would all fuse and be dis¬ 
sipated in the crucible of this species of interpretation. It would 
take the Bible from us and lay upon our breasts, cold and heavy, 
a Swedenborgian nightmare of correspondences.” 

Among the Reformed theologians who rejected Zwingli’s inter¬ 
pretation we may note Keckermann (f 1609) and John Piscator 
(f 1625). Piscator thus writes: “In the copula is there can be 
no trope” (in copula est non posse esse tropum). 

However, must we then not adopt Calvin’s interpretation? 
Calvin, as said before, interpreted the words of institution to read: 
“This is the sign of My body (signum corporis)/' In other words, 
he affirmed that the words “My body” and “My blood” must be 
explained figuratively. Against this claim the Lutherans assert 
that the words do not allow a figurative interpretation, since Christ 
here speaks of that body which was given into death and of that 
bloodj/^ohich was shed for the remission of sins (Luther, St. L., 
XX, 1046 ff.). 

Hollaz says: “It is readily inferred that in the Eucharist 



516 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


with the consecrated bread there is given us to eat not a typical 
body or a figurative one, such as was the body of the paschal lamb, 
so far as it shadowed forth and prefigured the body of Christ; not 
a mystical body, which is the Church, Eph. 1,23; not the sign of 
a body, for that was not crucified for us; but the true and per¬ 
sonal body of Christ, belonging to the Son of God.” ( Doctr . 
Theol., p. 561.) 

Even Beza, the pronounced Calvinist, affirmed that the term 
body here cannot stand for sign of the body, since Christ describee 
as the materia the body which was given and the blood which 
was shed. For this reason the word body must be taken to denote 
the true, substantial, or essential body of Christ. (Beza, Rom. 2, 
De Coena: “Confiteor hie nullum tropum esse, quia signum pro- 
prie exponi necesse fuit, ne fallebemub.” 

Beza also rejected the explanation that in the words of insti¬ 
tution the words body and blood indicate the fruit and effect of 
Christ’s death, an explanation which even Hodge adopted (“To re¬ 
ceive the body and blood as offered in the Sacrament ... is to 
receive and appropriate the sacrificial virtue, or effects, of the death 
of Christ on the cross.” Syst. Theol., Ill, 646). 

Of this sort of explanation Beza states: “It would certainly 
be absurd to interpret the words body and blood with respect to 
the fruit and effect of the death of Christ” ( Epist.5 ad Aleman- 
num, p. 57, ed. Geneva). Beza himself rejected the doctrine of 
the real presence, which the Lutherans taught so strenuously, but 
he likewise rejected the interpretation of Calvin as absurd and 
impossible. (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 368 ff.) 

Calvin’s error is fully refuted by St. Paul, who teaches (not 
that the word body is to be interpreted as sign of body, but) that 
the bread is the communion ( xoivcovia ) of the body and the cup 
(wine) the communion of the blood of Christ, 1 Cor. 10, 16, 80 
that, “whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the 
Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord ” 
1 Cor. 11, 27; and who also says that “he that eateth and drinketh 
unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discern¬ 
ing the Lord’s body,” 1 Cor. 11, 29. This explanation, given by 
divine inspiration, decides the matter once for all and establishes 
the truth of both the sacramental union and the oral reception. 

Some Beformed theologians (Keckermann, Zanchi, Bucanus, 
etc.) assumed that the trope, or figure of speech, must be sought 
not in particular expressions of the words of institution, but 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


517 


rather in the entire statement (“This is My body”; “This is My 
blood”). However, in the final analysis their explanation is the 
same as that of Calvin ("Pants est symbolum sive signurn corporis 
Christi”). 

It goes without saying that, if the entire statement must be 
interpreted figuratively, then all the words ought to be interpreted 
tropically and not merely a few individual words. Krauth calls 
attention to this when he writes (Cons. Ref., p. 608if.): “The word 
eat they [the Eeformed] have interpreted literally; though why 
the eating ought not to be done symbolically, or mentally, to corre¬ 
spond with the symbolical, or mental, character of the body they 
cannot say. Certainly there are plenty of instances of a figurative 
use of the word eat, while there are none of such a use of the 
word is. The Quakers are more consistent.” 

In summary, it is clear that the Eeformed have no Scriptural 
ground whatever for the figurative interpretation of the words of 
institution. Their doctrine is based alone on the rationalistic 
axiom that (as Luther says) “Christ’s body must be at one place 
bodily and palpably, as a peasant is in his coat and trousers” 
(St. L., XX, 950. 953. 1776), since it has only a local and visible 
presence (localis et visibilis praesentia). 

Calvin expressly styled the Lutheran doctrine of the illocal 
and repletive presence of Christ’s human nature (John 20, 19; 
Eph. 1, 20—23; 4,10) a ridiculous notion (stultum commentum), 
because in that case the human nature of Christ would be destroyed. 
In his Inst., TV, 17. 29 (tr. by John Allen) he says: “It is essen¬ 
tial to a real body to have its particular form and dimension and 
to be contained within some certain space. Let us hear no more, 
then, of the ridiculous notion which fastens the minds of men and 
Christ Himself to the bread.” 

At this point the Calvinists argue as rationalistically as when 
they deny the gratia universalis on the ground that not all are 
actually saved or when they deny the true communion of natures 
in Christ (realis communio) on the ground that the finite is not 
capable of the infinite (Finitum non est capax infiniti). (Cp. Oeco- 
lampadius against Luther: “Our reason is that the body of Christ 
is in heaven; that is certain and cannot be wrong.” St. L., 
XX, 591 ff.) 

This rationalistic interpretation of Scripture, Calvin employs 
quite consistently. According to Calvin, Christ did not appear 
before His disciples through closed doors (John 20,19), but opened 



518 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


the door and so came to them quite naturally. Again, Christ did 
not vanish out of the sight of the two disciples at Emmaus (Luke 
24,31), but merely closed their eyes, so that they could not see 
Him. Moreover, the right hand of God is not God’s majesty and 
omnipotent power, as Scripture distinctly teaches, Is. 48, 13; Ps. 
89,13.14; 118,15.16; 20,6; Ex. 15, 6. 12, but a definite place 
where Christ is enclosed till the end of the world. The omni¬ 
presence of Christ, so strongly attested in Matt. 28, 20, Calvin 
predicates only of the divine nature of Christ. 

As an ingrained rationalist, Calvin also argues that Christ’s 
human nature would become locally extended, or infinite (immense) 
if omnipresence (the real presence) would be ascribed to it. Hence, 
with the exception of sinlessness, Calvin avers, we must predicate 
of the human nature of Christ nothing that cannot be predicated 
of any other human nature. Calvinism on this point is therefore 
as rationalistic as is Unitarianism; the difference between the two 
is only that, while Unitarianism unfortunately is consistent, deny¬ 
ing the entire supernatural content of Scripture, Calvinism fortu¬ 
nately is inconsistent and does not draw all the conclusions which 
its rationalistic premises demand. 

Against the Calvinists, who charged the Lutherans with 
teaching a local extension of Christ’s body (ubiquitas localis, ex- 
tensio localis), our dogmaticians declared: “We indeed affirm the 
communicated omnipresence of Christ’s human nature (ubiquitas 
personalis et supernaturalis, i. e., omnipraesentia), but no local ex¬ 
tension (ubiquitas localis). The doctrine of the (local) ubiquity, 
which the Calvinists ascribed to the Lutherans, is a Calvinistic 
figment, fabricated for the purpose of ridiculing and disproving the 
Lutheran doctrine of the real presence. 

Since the Calvinists cannot prove their erroneous doctrine 
against the real presence, to which they cling so tenaciously, from 
the words of institution, they resort to John 6, 53—56. Their 
argument is: Since the eating of the flesh and the drinking of 
the blood of Christ in this passage must be understood spiritually, 
or of faith, the same is true also of the words of institution. But 
that the two passages are not parallel and do not treat of one and 
the 6ame matter is obvious from the fact that Christ in John 6, 
53—56 guarantees eternal life to all who “eat His flesh and drink 
His blood,” while in the Holy Supper the body of Christ may be 
eaten to damnation, 1 Cor. 11, 29. 

The Lutheran dogmaticians therefore teach that in John 6, 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


519 


53—56 Christ indeed speaks of faith (this against the Romanists, 
who use this passage to support their error of transubstantiation), 
while in Matt. 26, 26—28 and all parallel passages He speaks of a 
true sacramental eating (this against the Reformed). (Cp. Christl. 
Dogmatik, III, 384 ff.) 

Against the claim that, since the words of institution have led 
to so much controversy, they cannot be regarded as adequate to 
determine the doctrine of the Lord’s Supper, we reply that this 
principle in the final analysis would render impossible the use of 
all Scripture, since the entire Bible has always been in controversy. 
The argument therefore does not hold. Against the charge that 
the words of institution are too difficult to be a sedes doctrinae, 
we reply that they are difficult only if one refuses to believe 
what they say. Our dogmaticians have always emphasized the fact 
that the words of institution are clear in themselves and that only 
the conceited reason of unbelieving men makes them obscure. 

That the Calvinists, in spite of their violent opposition to the 
Lutherans, were not sure of their ground is shown by their union¬ 
ists spirit. Calvin, on the one hand, condemned the Lutheran 
doctrine as an “incantation of Satan” (diaboli incantatio); yet he 
as well as Zwingli demanded that the Lutherans regard them as 
brethren and maintain Christian fellowship with them. Of this 
Melanchthon writes: “They urged us very much to call them 
brethren. But behold their folly! Although they condemn us (as 
false teachers), they nevertheless desire that we should regard them 
as brethren.” (St. L., XVII, 1956.) Such unionism wantonly 
discards the Word of God and proposes to establish agreements 
suitable to reason, but condemned by Scripture, Rom. 16, 17; 
Titus 3, 10 . It is therefore just as rationalistic as is the rejection 
of the Scriptural doctrine of the real presence. 

Against the misconstructions which the Reformed have put on 
the Lutheran doctrine of the sacramental union our dogmaticians 
have said (Hafenreffer) :| “The sacramental union is a) not a tran¬ 
substantiation of the bread into the body of Christ; b) it is not 
a consubstantiation, or commixture of the two substances, but in 
both the bread and the wine the substance of the body and blood of 
Christ remains unmixed; c) nor is it a local or durable adhesion 
or conjunction to the bread and wine apart from the use of the 
Supper; d) nor is it an importation, that is, the inclusion of some 
small corpuscle lying hid under the bread; e) nor is it, finally, 
a personal union of the bread and body of Christ, such as exists

between the Son of God and the assumed humanity.” ( Docir. 
Theol., p. 671.) 

Quenstedt adds another thought to clear up the Scriptural 
doctrine of the sacramental union. He writes: <f We say that only 
the body of Christ is united with the bread, and only the blood is 
united with the wine, and (both are) sacramentally received by the 
mouth of the body. But the whole Christ is received spiritually, 
by the mouth of faith.” , ( Doctr. Theol., p. 670.) 

4. THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE AND THE WORDS 
OF INSTITUTION. 

It has been said that the various doctrines concerning the 
Lord’s Supper are only the results of different “interpretations” of 
the words of institution. Properly speaking, however, the Lu¬ 
theran doctrine is not an “interpretation” of the words of insti¬ 
tution, but merely the simple and plain presentation of the Scrip¬ 
ture doctrine set forth in these words. 

The papists indeed require much “interpretation” to demon¬ 
strate that the bread is transubstantiated into the body, that the 
cup must be withheld from the laity (concomitance), and that the 
whole sacramental act must be performed as an unbloody sacrifice 
for the sins of the living and the dead. It certainly requires a good 
deal of misinterpretation and “eisegesis” to prove these gross per¬ 
versions from clear Scripture-passages which teach quite the oppo¬ 
site, 1 Cor. 10,16; Luke 22,19.20; Heb. 9,11—15. 

Similarly the Reformed have proved by their many divergent 
views that it is indeed “labor and sorrow” for them to establish 
their error on the basis of Scripture. They must show by much 
painful “interpretation” that the words “This is My body, given 
for you; this is My blood, shed for you” do not mean what they 
say, but rather what the rebellious reason of doubting Zwinglians 
wants them to say, namely, that the faith of the believer must 
elevate itself to heaven and there unite spiritually with Christ, 
whose human nature, they say, is enclosed in heaven. 

In particular they must explain away 1 Cor. 10, 16 and 
11,27—29. They must furthermore explain why Christ did not 
say in the words of institution what according to their view He 
should have said. Then they must explain why the Lord’s Supper 
is at all necessary if it is no more than a symbol of a faith-union, 
which takes place also outside the Sacrament. In short, they are 
confronted with the impossible task of proving the absence of 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


521 


Christ’s body when Scripture so emphatically teaches and proves 
the real presence. 

The Lutherans, on the contrary, take the words in their simple 
meaning, just as they read, and trust that Christ, who has made 
the promise, is able also to fulfil it. In this they follow the time- 
honored hermeneutic rule that we must not depart from the literal 
meaning of the text unless the text itself compels us to do so. 
The Lutheran doctrine therefore rests on Scriptural ground and is 
in agreement not only with the words of institution, but also with 
every other passage of Scripture that treats of the Holy Supper. 

Against the claim of the Lutherans that their doctrine rests 
upon the literal sense of the words of institution, the Reformed 
(including Hodge, Syst. Theol., Ill, 662) have set up the counter¬ 
claim that the Lutherans, too, “have given up the literal sense” of 
the words. This accusation is based upon the fact that the Lu¬ 
therans admit that “the cup is used metonymically for the wine in 
the cup.” To this we reply that we indeed admit this metonymy 
(synecdoche), the container (“this cup”) being named for the thing 
therein contained; for Scripture itself tells us: “And they all 
drank of it,” Mark 14,23. What the disciples drank was not the 
goblet, but the wine in the cup. In other words, Scripture itself 
establishes the metonymy in this case. But that point is beside the 
question, since the literal interpretation, upon which the Lutherans 
insist, does not apply to the expression cup, but rather to the state¬ 
ments: “This is My body”; “this is My blood.” 1 The bread is 
indeed Christ’s body, and the wine is His blood, yet not, as the 
papists teach, because of transubstantialion, but on account of the 
sacramental union (propter unionem sacramentalem).. 

Again, the Reformed seek to substantiate their indictment 
against the Lutherans (“They have given up the literal sense”) by 
referring to their explanation “in, with, and under.” But the use 
of this expression does not involve a departure from the literal 
sense of the words of institution; it is but an amplification of the 
literal sense of the words. Hodge does the same thing when he 
amplifies the words “who is in the bosom of the Father,” John 
1,18, thus: “who is, was, and ever shall be in the bosom of the 
Father.” What Hodge here writes is correct, and neither a Re¬ 
formed nor a Lutheran theologian would charge him at this place 
with using “figurative language.” The phrase “in, with, and 
under” fittingly serves the purpose of repudiating the papistic 
error of transubstantiation and of affirming, in opposition to the 



522 


THE DOCTRINE OP THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


error of the Reformed, the Scriptural doctrine of the sacra¬ 
mental union. 

However, Hodge bases his charge on yet another point. He 
writes: “If the words of Christ are to be taken literally, they 
teach the doctrine of transubstantiation. ... If the bread is liter¬ 
ally the body of Christ, it is no longer bread; for no one asserts 
that the same thing can be bread and flesh (or rather, the body 
of Christ) at the same time.” This argument we already con¬ 
sidered when we spoke of the locutio exhibitiva; for there we 
showed that not even Hodge is willing to concede in another point 
(Luke 1,35: “The Holy Thing shall be called the Son of Q-od”) 
what he here demands. But Hodge’s argument: “If the bread is 
the body of Christ, it is no longer bread, but only body” does not 
follow; for St. Paul, by divine inspiration, assures us that the 
bread remains bread even after consecration, 1 Cor. 10,16. The 
argument of Hodge therefore directs itself not against Luther, but 
against Scripture. To the charge that it is a blasphemy to say 
that “the bread is Christ’s body” we answer that Christ Himself 
makes this statement, so that the decision in this matter rests 
with Him. Holy Scripture never blasphemes God, but always 
glorifies Him. 

It is a common charge that the Lutheran doctrine of the real 
presence rests not on the words of institution, but rather on the 
doctrine of the person of Christ. This charge is absurd, for the 
very opposite is true. The Lutherans would never have drawn into 
the discussion of the doctrine of the Holy Supper that of the 
person of Christ had not their opponents compelled them to prove 
that the body of Christ can really be present in the Lord’s Supper. 

Because the Reformed predicated of the body of Christ only 
a local and visible presence, the Lutherans were forced to show 
that Scripture ascribes to the Son of Man not only a local (prae- 
sentia localis, circumscriptiva), but also an illocal (pmesentia 
illocalis, invisibilis, definitiva) and a peculiar divine presence 
(pmesentia divina et repletiva). The first is predicated of Christ 
in John 4, 4; the second, in John 20,19; the third, in Eph. 4,10 
(to name only a few Scripture-passages). When Lutherans there¬ 
fore read Matt. 28, 20, they do not think of Christ’s presence ac¬ 
cording to His divine nature only, as do the Calvinists, but also of 
the presence of His human nature by reason of its communicated 
pmesentia illocalis, divina, repletiva. The whole divine-human 
Christ is present with His Church to the end of time.

5. DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE WORDS 
OF INSTITUTION. 

Every Bible student knows that the words of institution are 
not quoted in precisely the same manner by all the sacred writers. 
Modern exegetes have therefore gone to much trouble to ascertain 
the original words (ipsissima verba) which Christ employed when 
He instituted the holy Sacrament. However, Cremer rightly says 
(RE. 3 I, 35) : “Which the ipsissima verba are cannot be deter¬ 
mined.” Yet from the different accounts we must not conclude 
that the Bible is not verbally inspired (cp. Kahnis, Dogmatik} I, 
666 ff.), but rather that “Christ at the institution of the Sacrament 
did not repeat the words in the same stereotyped form” (Noesgen), 
so that all the holy writers quote them correctly, though they cite 
them in various ways. 

After all, however, there is no actual difference between the 
various accounts with respect to the doctrine that is taught in the 
words of institution. The words concerning the bread unanimously 
affirm the same truth: “This is My body,” Matt. 26,26; Mark 
14, 22; Luke 22,19; 1 Cor. 11, 24. The words concerning the cup 
show a greater variation, though they also affirm one and the same 
doctrine. Matthew and Mark directly denote the blood as the 
sacramental gift (Matt. 26,28: “This is My blood of the new 
testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins”; Mark 
14, 24: “This is My blood of the new testament, which is shed for 
many”). On the other hand, the words of Luke and St. Paul desig¬ 
nate directly the object (finis) of the Holy Supper as a means 
of grace, namely, the “new testament,” or “remission of sins” 
(Luke 22, 20: “This cup is the new testament in My blood, which 
is shed for you”; 1 Cor. 11,25: “This cup is the new testament 
in My blood”). 

That the new testament (New Covenant) is essentially God’s 
gracious remission of sins is clear from direct Scripture-passages 
(cp. Jer. 31, 31—34 with Rom. 11, 27: “This is My covenant unto 
them when I shall take away their sins”; also with Heb. 8, 8—12; 
10,16. 17). The old testament was the covenant of the Law, which 
imputed sin and pronounced damnation (2 Cor. 3, 9: “the minis¬ 
tration of condemnation”); but the new testament is the covenant 
of the Gospel, which forgives sin and announces salvation through 
the blood of Christ (2 Cor. 3, 9: “the ministration of righteous¬ 
ness”). “Righteousness” here denotes the iustitia imputata, or the 
forgiveness of sins for Christ’s sake; for it stands in contrast to 



624 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


"condemnation.” Luther writes regarding this point (St. L., XX*. 
278 ff.): "What else is the new testament than the forgiveness of 
sins, secured for us by Christ and offered to us in the Sacrament?’* 

The words "in My blood” (Luke, St. Paul) show the reason 
why the cup is the new testament, or the forgiveness of sins; for 
the cup is the new testament on account of the blood of Christ 
which is offered in it (Luther: “tneines Blutes halben”; Chem¬ 
nitz: propter sanguinem meum; Meyer: " vermoege meines 
Blutes"). 

If the objection is raised that in the statement “This cup is 
the new testament by virtue of My blood” the verb “is” must be 
taken in the sense of “signify,” we refer the reader to such passages 
as John 11,25: Tam the Resurrection and the Life,” and 6, 63: 
"My words are spirit, and they are life.” According to the first 
passage, Christ does not merely signify, but actually is, the Resur¬ 
rection and the Life, inasmuch as these heavenly gifts are found 
in Him and are offered to us by Him. According to the second 
passage the words of Christ do not merely signify spirit and life, 
but actually are spirit and life, because these heavenly gifts are 
contained in them and are offered to us by them. In the same 
way the cup does not merely signify the new testament, but actually 
is the new testament, or the forgiveness of sins; for with the shed 
blood of Christ which is therein contained it truly offers the for¬ 
giveness which our Savior secured for us by His death on the cross. 
(Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 410 ff.) 

This is the clear doctrine which Scripture inculcates in the 
words of institution and which accordingly the Lutheran Church 
teaches and confesses without any regard for the objections of 
man’s doubting reason on this point. According to the Lutheran 
doctrine the words of institution, no matter how they are quoted, 
all express the same sublime truth, namely, that in, with, and under 
the bread and wine, as by true vehicula et media collativa, the 
communicant receives Christ’s true body and blood for the gra¬ 
cious remission of his sins (ad veniam peccatorum impetrandam). 

6. THE MATERIAL ELEMENTS IN THE LORD’S SUPPER. 

The Lutheran Church confesses with the ancient Christian 
Church “according to the words of Irenaeus that in this Sacrament 
there are two things, a heavenly and an earthly” ( Formula of Con¬ 
cord, Thor. Decl., VII, 14). The heavenly elements (material 
coelestes) are the true body and blood of Christ. So the Formula 
of Concord says: “With the bread and wine the body and blood 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


525 


■of Christ are truly and essentially present, offered, and received.** 
The earthly elements (materiae terrenae) in the divinely instituted 
action (actio) of the Holy Supper are true bread and wine. As 
in Baptism we dare not employ another material element than 
water, so also in Holy Communion we dare not depart from the 
elements (elementa, species) which Christ has definitely fixed. 
That Christ used bread is clear from the words of institution, 
Matt. 26,26; that He used wine ( olvoe) is proved by the expression 
''"this fruit of the vine" (ix xovxov xov yevv^/xaxog xijc d/ojiekov), 
Matt. 26,29. 

While heretics in the ancient Church frequently used substi¬ 
tutes for wine (Encratites: milk, honey, unfermented grape-juice), 
the Christian Church has always condemned such surrogates as not 
permissible. The argument that the expression “the fruit of the 
vine” is a generic term, which embraces all products of the vine 
and therefore also grape-juice does not hold, since Christ used the 
expression in question as a special term for wine, which was in¬ 
variably used by the Jews at their sacred festivals. Quite mani¬ 
festly the expression ykvvr\(ia xrje dfxniXov is the Greek for jwn 
which even to-day the orthodox Jews use in their consecration of 
the Kiddush cup (“Blessed art Thou, Lord, our God, King of the 
world. Creator of the fruit of the vine": qta ^"12 

loan na ania D^ripn). 

The objection against the use of wine in the Holy Supper 
would never have been raised, had not fanaticism declared the use 
of wine objectionable in general, contrary to the clear words of 
Scripture, 1 Tim. 5, 23; Eccl. 9, 7; Ps. 104,15. 

With respect to the wafers (Eostien), which are in use in the 
Lutheran Church, the Christian minister must carefully instruct 
his people that these are bread in the true sense of the term, but 
in themselves not a better materia terrena than is ordinary bread. 

It is necessary for the sacramental union that the material 
elements should really be distributed (distrxbutio) and received 
(sumptio) by the communicants; for the sacramental union occurs 
only in the sacramental action and not outside it. Ipsa sacramen~ 
talis unio non fit nisi in distributions. Hence the “consecrated 
host” used by the Romanists for adoration is not Christ’s true body, 
but a mere piece of bread, and its worship is idolatry. Panis 
extra usum a Christo institutum non est corpus Christi. 

The axiom of the ancient Christians and the Lutheran 
Church: “Nothing has the nature of a Sacrament apart from the 



526 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


use instituted by Christ 5 ’ (Nihil habet rationem sacramenti extra 
vsum a Christo institutum) is based directly on the words of insti¬ 
tution (“Eat, drink 55 ) and is therefore Scriptural. (Cp. Formula 
of Concord, Thor. Decl., VII, 85.) 

Whether the bread is received directly with the mouth as 
offered by the pastor or first taken in the communicant’s own hand 
is immaterial (adiaphoron); some Reformed erroneously con¬ 
tended that the latter alone is correct. 

Also the “breaking” of the bread must be regarded as an 
adiaphoron, though some Reformed theologians insisted upon this 
act, since according to their view the breaking of the bread signifies 
the death of Christ on the cross (whose bones, however, were not 
broken, John 19, 33. 36). At the first Communion the “breaking” 
was accidental; the bread was broken in order that it could be 
distributed, Luke 24, 30; 1 Cor. 10,16. 

As the material elements which Christ used should not be 
changed, so also the celestial elements must be left intact. That 
is to say, we must not designate as the materia coelestis anything- 
else than Christ’s body and blood. In particular, we must not 
regard as the materia coelestis — 

a) The “entire Christ,” or “Christ’s person” (Calvinists, Ro¬ 
manists, some modern Lutheran theologians), since Christ expressly 
offers us His body and blood to eat and to drink. Beyond the 
words of institution (“This is My body; this is My blood”) we 
dare not argue with respect to any sacramental presence of Christ. 
“Only His body and blood are united with the elements and are 
received orally.” (Luthardt.) The papistic doctrine of “con¬ 
comitance” (with the body the communicant receives the blood) 
is as unscriptural as is that of transubstantiation. 

b) Nor must we substitute for Christ’s body and blood as the 
materia coelestis merely the benefits of Christ (beneficia), or the 
efficacy of His body and blood (virtus), or His merits (merita), etc. 
(Reformed and modern theologians). While it is true that we 
receive all of Christ’s blessings by faith, it is true also that they 
were not “given and shed” for us, so that in the Lord’s Supper we 
do not receive them orally with the mouth (oral reception). 

c) Again, the materia coelestis is not the Holy Ghost or His 
supernatural operation (Calvin). Even Beza declared that it is 
absurd to substitute for the body and blood of Christ in the Sacra¬ 
ment the Holy Spirit and His divine operation, since these were 
not given into death for us. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


627 


d) Furthermore, the materia coelestis is not the spiritual 
fellowship with Christ and the engrafting of the believer into His 
body, the Church. While spiritual fellowship is indeed a fruit and 
effect of the Sacrament upon all who believe the divine promise, 
it is not the materia coelestis for the reason aforementioned. 

e) Lastly also the glorified body of Christ, or the glorified 
Christ, is not the materia coelestis, as Calvin and some modern 
theologians claimed, since our Lord designates as such only the 
tody that was given and the blood which was shed. The glorifica¬ 
tion of Christ has nothing to do with His real presence in Holy 
Communion, which rests entirely a) on His divine promise: “Take, 
eat; this is My body,” and b) on the fact of the personal union, 
by which the human nature of Christ received truly divine attri¬ 
butes (omnipresence), so that it really can be present in the Lord’s 
Supper. In other words, the real presence rests upon the fact that 
Christ’s body is the body of the Son of God. 

In short, we must not substitute for the body and blood of 
Christ as materia coelestis anything which our Lord has not Him¬ 
self named in the words of institution, since this would be unscrip- 
tural and, besides, would cause confusion. The sacramental union 
consists only in the union of the bread with the body and of the 
wine with the blood. 

While the papists reject the Scriptural doctrine of the sacra¬ 
mental union in toto and substitute for it transubstantiation, the 
Calvinists, on the other hand, profess to teach the unio sacramen- 
taiis. However, they understand by this term nothing more than 
the union of the believer with the absent Christ by faith, so that in 
reality their sacramental union is only significative, representative, 
or symbolical (unio significativa, repraesentativa, symbolica). 

Their sacramental union is therefore no more of a real union 
than is that produced by a glance at a crucifix or at a picture of 
Christ, which, by the recalling of our Savior to our memory, makes 
Him present in our minds. The Calvinists also frequently speak of 
their sacramental union as unio vera, realis, substantialis, etc.; 
yet in spite of this fact they deny the substantial presence (realis 
praesentia) of Christ’s body in the Sacrament, so that, after all, 
they teach no sacramental union at all. 

The Lutherans, on the contrary, regard the sacramental union 
between the bread and the body and between the wine and the 
blood as so real and intimate that in the sacramental act the com¬ 
municant receives Christ’s true body and blood in, with, and under 



528 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


the bread and wine (manducatio oralis), the bread and wine indeed 
in a natural manner (manducatio naturdlis), but the body and 
blood in a supernatural, incomprehensible manner. 

The Lutherans very strenuously reject the charge that the real 
presence implies a local inclusion, or an impanation, or consubstan- 
tiation (localis inclusio, impanatio, consubstantiatio). The For¬ 
mula of Concord thus says (Thor. Decl., "VTI, 64): “For this com¬ 
mand [fEat and drink’] cannot be understood otherwise than of 
oral eating and drinking; however, not in a gross, carnal, Caper- 
naitic, but in a supernatural, incomprehensible way.” 

The accusation that the Lutherans teach a natural, or Caper- 
naitic, eating and drinking has been preferred against them both by 
Reformed and non-Reformed theologians (Harnack, Frank, etc.). 
(Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 423 ff.) However, not only Luther 
(St. L., XX, 811) and the Lutheran Confessions ( Formula of Con¬ 
cord, Thor. Decl., VII, 16), but also all Lutheran dogmaticians at 
all times have repudiated this erroneous doctrine in unmistak¬ 
able terms. 

7. WHAT MAKES THE LORD’S SUPPER A SACRAMENT. 

(Forma Coenae Sacrae.) 

Because the Lord’s Supper is a Sacrament which should be 
celebrated till the end of time, 1 Cor. 11, 26, we must deal also with 
the important question, What produces the true presence of the 
body and blood of Christ in the Holy Supper? According to the 
Reformed view there can be no true Sacrament unless the com¬ 
municants have true faith in Christ. In other words, it is the 
faith of the believer that makes the eating and drinking a true 
Sacrament. 

In refutation of this error the Formula of Concord writes 
(Thor. Decl., VII, 74): “Not the word or work of any man pro¬ 
duces the true presence of the body and blood of Christ in the 
Supper, whether it be the merit or recitation of the minister or 
the eating and drinking or faith of the communicants; but all this 
should be ascribed alone to the power of Almighty God and the 
word, institution, and ordination of our Lord Jesus Christ.” 

Also Luther, whom the Formula of Concord here quotes, 
affirms: “His [Christ’s] command and institution have this power 
and effect, that we administer and receive not mere bread and wine, 
but His body and blood, as His words declare: “This is My 
body,’ etc.; ‘This is My blood,’ etc., so that it is not our work or 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


529 


speaking, but the command and ordination of Christ that makes 
the bread the body and the wine the blood from the beginning of 
the first Supper even to the end of the world.” (Ibid., 77.) 

Again: “Thus here also, even though I should pronounce over 
all bread the words ‘This is Christ’s body,’ nothing, of course, 
would result therefrom; but when in the Supper we say, according 
to His [Christ’s] institution and command: ‘This is My body,’ 
it is His body, not on account of our speaking or word uttered, but 
because of His command, that He has commanded us thus to speak 
and to do and has united His command and act with our speaking.” 
(Ibid., 78.) 

This doctrine is Scriptural; for neither the faith of man 
(Reformed) nor the power of the priesthood (Romanists) nor any 
magic influence of the spoken word makes the eating or drinking 
a Lord’s Supper, or Sacrament, but only Christ’s institution and 
command: “This do ye.” 

The Formula of Concord stands on solid Scripture ground 
when it declares: “The true and almighty words of Jesus Christ 
which He spake at the first institution were efficacious not only at 
the first Supper, but they endure, are valid, operate, and are still 
efficacious, ... so that in all places where the Supper is celebrated 
according to the institution of Christ and His words are used, the 
body and blood of Christ are truly present, distributed, and re¬ 
ceived because of the power and efficacy of the words which Christ 
spake at the first Supper. ... As Chrysostom says in his Sermon 
concerning the Passion: ‘Christ Himself prepares this table and 
blesses it; for no man makes the bread and wine set before us the 
body and blood of Christ, but Christ Himself who was crucified 
for us. . . . Just as the declaration Gen. 1, 28: “Be fruitful and 
multiply and replenish the earth,” was spoken only once, but is 
ever efficacious in nature, so that it is fruitful and multiplies, also 
this declaration [“This is My body; this is My blood”] was spoken 
once, but even to this day and to His advent it is efficacious and 
works so that in the Supper of the Church His true body and blood 
are present.’” (Ibid., 75. 76.) 

The charge of the Calvinists that the Lutherans, like the Ro¬ 
manists, attribute the real presence in the Lord’s Supper to the 
word and authority of man is therefore absolutely false. 

Just because the Lutherans teach that the true presence of 
Christ’s body and blood in the Holy Supper depends on Christ’s 
institution and command, they, in accord with the ancient Chris- 

34 


CHKIBTIAN DOGMATICS. 



580 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


tian Church, 1 Cor. 10,16, retain the words of institution for the 
consecration ( consecratio, evkoyia) of the material elements. 
Calvin, who opposed the papistic consecration as a “magic incan¬ 
tation,” emphatically denied the necessity of the consecration on 
the ground that it has nothing to do with the sacramental action. 

In opposition to this unscriptural notion (cp. 1 Cor. 10,16) the 
j Formula of Concord (Thor. Decl., VII, 79—82) insists upon the 
recitation of the words of institution for three reasons: a) “that 
obedience may be rendered to the command of Christ”; b) “that 
the faith of the hearers concerning the nature and fruit of this 
Sacrament may be excited, strengthened, and confirmed”; and 
c) “that the elements of bread and wine may be consecrated or 
blessed for this holy use.” 

Even Hodge (Syst. Theol., Ill, 618) declares that “the bread 
and the cup were blessed” in order that “the bread and wine might 
be symbols of His body and blood,” though, according to 1 Cor. 
10,16, he should have said: “that the bread might be the com¬ 
munion of the body and the wine the communion of the blood.” 
Hodge at least admits that the blessing (consecration) related to 
the sacramental act, not merely to the persons, as Calvin taught. 

The Lutherans rightly insist upon the use of the words of 
institution in the Holy Supper no less than in Holy Baptism. 
While they do not regard the accidental omission or mispronuncia¬ 
tion of a word or an unintentional error that may occur during 
the consecration as an offense by which the whole Sacrament is 
invalidated, they demand that “the words of institution are to be 
publicly spoken or sung distinctly and clearly and should in no 
way be omitted.” ( Formula of Concord, Thor. Decl., VII, 79.) 

The question whether or not the mere good intention of the 
celebrants could sufficiently consecrate the material elements can 
hardly be treated seriously. It belongs to the curiosae quaestiones 
which we answer best by not paying any attention to them. 

Since the Lord’s Supper is a Sacrament not by the faith or 
work of man, but only through the institution and command of 
our Lord, it follows that also unworthy guests, or unbelieving com¬ 
municants, receive Christ’s true body and blood (manducatio 
generaUs). This truth Scripture states expressly in 1 Cor. 11, 
27. 29, so that the Reformed, who deny the manducatio indi- 
gnorum, repudiate a clear teaching of Scripture. However, just as 
they reject the manducatio indignorum, so they also reject the 



THE DOCTRINE OP THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


631 


manducatio dignorum, that is, the oral reception of Christ’s body 
and blood by the believer. 

According to Reformed teaching Christ’s body is not at all 
present in the Holy Supper, and therefore it is orally received 
neither by the worthy nor by the unworthy. Zwingli: “In eucha- 
ristia nihil oXiud est quam commemoratio.” — “Quanto fides est 
maior et sanctior, tanto magis contenta est spirituali manduca- 
tione” In the Wittenberg Concordia (1536) Luther expressly 
insisted that his Sacramentarian opponents should acknowledge the 
manducatio indignorum; for by this test he could ascertain whether 
they agreed to the doctrine of the real presence or not. 

Because it is solely the institution and command of Christ 
which makes the Lord’s Supper a Sacrament, a means of grace, 
it follows also that neither the papists nor the Calvinists have 
that true Holy Communion which our Savior instituted. Their 
"supper” lies entirely outside the institution of our Lord (extra 
usum a Christo institutum) since it is neither based upon it nor 
is in accord with it. 

Concerning the Mass of the Romanists the Formula of Con¬ 
cord writes (Thor. Deck, VII, 86. 87): "If the institution of 
Christ be not observed as He appointed it, there is no Sacra¬ 
ment. ... And the use, or action, here does not mean chiefly faith, 
neither the oral participation only, but the entire external, visible 
action of the Lord’s Supper instituted by Christ, the consecration, 
or words of institution, the distribution and reception, or oral par¬ 
taking of the consecrated bread and wine, [likewise the partaking] 
of the body and blood of Christ. Apart from this use, when in the 
papistic Mass the bread is not distributed, but offered up or in¬ 
closed, borne about, and exhibited for adoration, it is to be re¬ 
garded as no Sacrament.” 

Similarly Luther writes of the private masses (Winkelmessen) 
(St. L., XIX, 1265): "In the private Mass we find not only the 
abuse, or sin, that the priest acts and receives unworthily; but 
even if the priest should be holy and worthy, nevertheless the very 
essence of Christ’s institution is removed (tamen ipsa substantia 
Christi sublata est); the real ordinance and institution of Christ 
they take away and create their own ordinance. . . . Hence no one 
can or should believe that there is Christ’s body and blood because 
His institution is not there.” 

With respect to the "supper” of the Reformed some Lutheran 
dogmaticians (Fecht, Dannhauer, etc.) judged that they have the 



532 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


true Holy Communion which Christ instituted, so that they receive 
Christ’s body and blood whenever they partake of it. This argu¬ 
ment was based upon the fact that the Calvinists retain the words 
of institution. But the “supper” of the Calvinists lies outside 
the institution of Christ, since they expressly renounce the words 
of institution by declaring that the doctrine of the real presence 
is an “abomination” and that they do not come together to perpe¬ 
trate such an offense, but only to celebrate a “memorial feast” in 
remembrance of Christ’s death. Zwingli: “Should we want to be 
cannibals (anthropophagi) f’ From this it is clear that the 
“supper” of the Reformed is without the word and promise of 
Christ, so that it cannot be a true Lord’s Supper. 

Luther’s verdict on this point is very emphatic. He writes: 
“Our present opponents of the Sacrament have nothing but bread 
and wine; for they have not the words and the appointed ordinance 
of God, but they have perverted and changed them according to 
their own self-conceived notion.” (Formula of Concord, Thor. 
Decl., VII, 32.) 

While we rightly reject the Reformed “supper” as no Lord’s 
Supper at all, we acknowledge their Baptism as valid, since their 
errors with respect to this Sacrament relate not to its essence, but 
only to its fruit and effect. (Cp. Dr. Walther, Pastorale, p. 181.) 

With respect to the question whether the sacramental union 
(unio sacramentalis) occurs directly upon the consecration and 
before the distribution and reception (ante usum), a point on 
which John Saliger (pastor in Luebeck and Rostock) insisted, the 
Formula of Concord judges rightly (Thor. Decl., VII, 83. 84): 
“This blessing, or the recitation of the words of institution of 
Christ, alone does not make a Sacrament if the entire action of 
the Supper as it was instituted by Christ is not observed; . . . 
but the command of Christ ‘This do’ (which embraces the entire 
action or administration in this Sacrament . . .) must be observed 
unseparated and inviolate, as also St. Paul places before our eyes 
the entire action of the breaking of bread or of distribution and 
reception, 1 Cor. 10,16.” 

This decision is of great practical importance; for only the 
consecration in connection with the actual distribution and recep¬ 
tion, as Christ has appointed this, guarantees us the real presence 
of Christ’s body and blood in the Lord’s Supper. If the elements 
are only consecrated, but not distributed and received, there is no 
Lord’s Supper. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


533 


This truth Quenstedt ably defended against Bellarmine’s con¬ 
tention that Christ’s body must be present by virtue of the conse¬ 
cration even without the distribution, since Christ says: “This is 
My body.” He replied that Christ said: “This is My body” of that 
bread of which He first had said: “Take and eat” (II, 1268). 
Hence Christ’s body and blood are really present with the conse¬ 
crated earthly elements only when we eat and drink them. “Ad ex- 
ternam actionem requiritur consecratio, distributio et sumptio.” 
(Formula of Concord, VII, 86.) 

8. THE PURPOSE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 

(Finis cuius Coenae Sacrae.) 

Of the design of the Holy Supper we had to speak already in 
an earlier chapter, since the purpose of this Sacrament is most 
intimately connected with its essence (forma). On account of the 
importance of this matter we here repeat what was said before for 
the sake of greater clearness and emphasis. 

In his Small Catechism, Luther summarizes the purpose of 
the Holy Supper under the question: “What is the benefit of such 
eating and drinking?” as follows: “That is shown us by these 
words, ‘Given and shed for you for the remission of sins’; namely, 
that in the Sacrament forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation are 
given us through these words. For where there is forgiveness of 
sins, there is also life and salvation.” The great Reformer here 
points out that Christ’s explanation “which is given for you” and 
“which is shed for you” (Luke 22,19. 20) is added to the words 
“This is My body; this is My blood” to show the benefit, or object, 
of the eating and drinking, or of the Holy Supper. 

It is true, these words also describe the body and blood of 
Christ as His real and true body and blood. At the same time, 
however, they also show the purpose of the eating and drinking; 
for as the body was given into death and the blood was shed for 
the remission of our sins, so in the Holy Supper they are offered 
and imparted to the communicant for the remission of his sins. 
It is because of this fact that some of the sacred writers (Luke 
and St. Paul) say directly: “This cup is the new testament in 
My blood,” Luke 22, 20; 1 Cor. 11, 25; for these words mean: 
“With this body and blood I offer to you the new testament, or the 
gracious forgiveness of sins.” The peculiar gift of the Lord’s 
Supper is therefore, as Luther rightly says, forgiveness of sins, 
life, and salvation, or precisely the same blessing which the Gospel 



534 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


conveys generally and Baptism individually. Baptism offers this 
gift through the application of water; the Lord’s Supper, through 
the reception, by the communicant, of Christ’s body and blood in, 
with, and under the bread and wine. 

In this connection it may be pointed out that both Reformed 
and modernistic theologians (Harnack) accuse Luther of having 
so emphasized the real presence that he lost sight of the final 
purpose of the Lord’s Supper, namely, the apprehension of the 
merits of Christ by faith. But this is one of the manifest mis¬ 
representations, of which the student of church history finds so 
many. It is true, Luther did place emphasis on the doctrine of 
the real presence, but for the simple reason that this was the chief 
status controversial in his conflict with the Sacramentarians. As 
a matter of fact, however, he regarded the real presence only as 
a means to the end. He insisted upon the true presence of Christ’s 
body and blood in the Sacrament in order that he might the more 
clearly and assuredly proclaim its comfort and declare its benefit, 
namely, the gracious forgiveness of sins. 

Luther did not put the real presence in place of the sola fide , 
as Harnack erroneously claims, but rather taught that the sola fide 
is the only means by which God’s gracious forgiveness of sins, 
offered in the Lord’s Supper, can be obtained. He thus writes in 
the Small Catechism: “He that believes these words [“Given and 
shed for you for the remission of sins”] has what they say and 
express, namely, the forgiveness of sins.” Luther furthermore 
stressed the Scriptural doctrine that the oral reception of Christ’s 
body and blood is useless, yes, harmful, without faith, 1 Cor. 
11,29. In the Small Catechism he says: “But he that does not 
believe these words or doubts is unworthy and unprepared; for the 
words Tor you’ require all hearts to believe 

It is Luther’s doctrine, voiced by him from beginning to end, 
which the Formula of Concord declares when it says (Thor. Decl., 
VII, 53): “There is no doubt that also these words of Luke and 
Paul: ‘This cup is the new testament in My blood,’ can have no 
other meaning than that which St. Matthew and St. Mark give: 
‘This’ (namely, that which you orally drink out of the cup) ‘is My 
blood of the new testament,’ whereby I establish, seal, and confirm 
with you men this My testament and New Covenant, namely, the 
forgiveness of sins” In all his discussions on the subject, Luther 
never lost sight of the gracious forgiveness of sins which Holy 
Communion offers and conveys. To him the Lord’s Supper was 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


536 


a "dear and blessed Holy Supper” just because Christ has joined 
to His body and blood the gracious promise “Given for you; shed 
for you.” (St. L., XIX, 1292.) 

In connection with this point we may discuss also the ques¬ 
tion regarding the specific object of the communicant’s faith. The 
communicant of course must believe that Jesus Christ, true God 
and true man, died for his sins. Moreover, he must believe that 
this same Christ communicates to him in Holy Communion His 
true body and blood; for every one who refuses to believe this is 
an unworthy guest and eats and drinks damnation to himself, “not 
discerning the Lord’s body,” 1 Cor. 11,29. But even faith in the 
real presence is not yet saving faith. As Luther rightly says, the 
worthy communicant believes in the words “Given and shed 
for you.” That is to say, if any one wishes to be a worthy com¬ 
municant, he must believe that he personally receives forgiveness 
of sins, life, and salvation by receiving Christ’s body and blood, 
given and shed for him. 

That is the pivotal point in the whole doctrine of the Lord’s 
Supper. Luther argues this point under the question: “Who, 
then, receives such Sacrament worthily?” He writes in his Small 
Catechism: “He is truly worthy and well prepared who has faith 
in these words: ‘Given and shed for you for the remission of sins.’ ” 
As Luther points out, these words are a direct promise of forgive¬ 
ness to every communicant; and all who wish to be worthy com¬ 
municants must put their trust in this divine promise. In other 
words, they must believe what Scripture says concerning both the 
essence and the object (purpose) of Holy Communion. 

The doctrine that Christ in the Holy Supper offers forgive¬ 
ness of sins to the communicant is rejected by the papists. The 
Council of Trent directly anathematizes all who designate the 
gracious offer of forgiveness as the chief purpose of the Lord’s 
Supper (Trid., Be Sacrosancto Eucharistiae Sacramento, Can. 5). 
Similarly Carlstadt regarded it as “a base and abominable injury 
for our Christians to seek forgiveness of sins in the Sacrament” 
(S. L., XX, 94). Zwingli and Calvin likewise voiced a warning 
against the thought that “the visible sign, while being offered, 
produces also the grace of God” (Consensus Tigurinus). 

From the viewpoint of Calvinism this warning is quite in¬ 
telligible; for according to the Reformed view the Lord’s Supper 
cannot offer grace to all sinners, since, on the one hand, divine 
grace is not intended for all (denial of the gratia universalis ) and, 



536 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


on the other, there are no means of grace, which offer, seal, and 
convey forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation. (“In the work of 
regeneration all second causes are excluded.” “Nothing intervenes 
between the volition of the Spirit and the regeneration of the soul.” 
“The infusion of a new life into the soul is the immediate work of 
the Spirit.”) 

However, in view of this fact the Calvinists have no right to 
speak of the Holy Supper as a sign, seal, and pledge (signum, 
tessera, pignus) of divine grace secured by Christ Jesus, since to 
them it is only a “memorial feast,” celebrated in remembrance of 
Christ's death. 

The gracious forgiveness of sins, with life and salvation, is the 
foremost gift of the Holy Supper; all other blessings (beneficia) 
offered therein are only its concomitants. Among these blessings 
we may mention the gracious effects of this Sacrament, such as the 
strengthening of faith, the union with Christ and with His spir¬ 
itual body, the Church, growth in sanctification, furtherance in love 
toward God and the neighbor, increase in patience and in the hope 
of eternal life, greater joy in confessing Christ, 1 Cor. 11, 26, etc. 
Incidentally the Lord's Supper also serves the purpose of distin¬ 
guishing Christian believers from the heterodox and the ungodly. 

All these blessed effects are due to the fact that the Lord's 
Supper is a medium iustificationis, or a means by which we receive 
forgiveness of sins; for in proportion as the believer is assured of 
the forgiveness of his sins, his faith is strengthened, his love is 
increased, and his hope of eternal life is confirmed. Assured of 
his adoption as God’s child in Christ Jesus, he also struggles against 
sin and lives unto Him who died for him and rose again. In short, 
he loves God because He first loved him, 1 John 4,19. 

All those who deny that the Lord’s Supper is primarily a means 
of justification, or of forgiveness (Romanists, Calvinists, etc.), 
really render these gracious effects of the Holy Supper impossible. 
They change this beneficial “work of God upon us” into “a human 
work for God,” or, what is the same, they convert the Gospel- 
message of Holy Communion into one of Law and good works and 
so leave the communicant under the curse, Gal. 3,10. Indeed, as 
unworthy guests, who trust in their own righteousness, they eat and 
drink damnation to themselves, 1 Cor. 11, 29. 

How thoroughly the Romanists have perverted the doctrine of 
the purpose of the Lord’s Supper may be learned from the fol¬ 
lowing decisions of the Council of Trent: “Si quis dixerit, prae- 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 


537 


cipuum fructum eucharistiae esse bemissionem peccatobum, ana¬ 
thema sit ." (Sess. XIII, Can. 5.) " Si quis dixerit, in missa non 

offerri Deo verum et proprium saobipioium, anathema sit." “Si 
quis dixerit, missae sacrificium . . . non esse pbopitiatobium, . . . 
non pro peccatis, poenis, satisfactionibus et aliis necessitatibus 
offerri debere, anathema sit" (Sess. XXII, Cans. 1. 3.) Yet de¬ 
spite this emphasis on the sacrifice of the Mass the Roman Cate¬ 
chism (II, C. IV, Qu. 41) declares that in the Eucharist only the 
venial sins are forgiven. 

As the Romanists, so also the Calvinists deny that in the 
Lord’s Supper Christ offers and imparts forgiveness of sins. 
Zwingli: “Coena dominica mortis commemoratio est, non peccar 
torum remissio." Strong: “It symbolizes the death of Christ for 
our sins.” — “Baptism and the Lord’s Supper tell the story of 
redemption.” (Watchman-Examiner.) 

9. WHO MAY BE ADMITTED TO THE LORD’S SUPPER. 

(Finis cul Coenae Sacrae.) 

Christian ministers are only “stewards,” not lords, of the 
mysteries of God, 1 Cor. 4,1. For this reason they must admin¬ 
ister the means of grace (the Gospel and the Sacraments) just as 
Christ has instituted them, 1 Cor. 4, 2; Matt. 28, 20. Ministers or 
congregations departing from Christ’s institution in administering 
the Holy Supper reject His authority, oppose His will, misuse the 
precious Sacrament, and therefore “come together unto condemna¬ 
tion,” 1 Cor. 11, 29—34. — Concerning the right administration of 
the Lord’s Supper Holy Scripture teaches the following truths: — 

a. Not open, but close communion must be practised by the 
Christian Church, since it is God’s will that only believers should 
approach the Lord’s Table, 1 Cor. 11, 26—28. While the Gospel 
should be preached to believers and unbelievers alike. Matt. 16, 
15.16, the Lord’s Supper is designed only for the regenerate, as 
Christ’s words of institution and the normative practise of the holy 
apostles prove, 1 Cor. 10,16; 11, 26—34. 

Luther writes on this point (St. L., XI, 615) : “So Christ has 
done; the preaching [of the Gospel] He permitted to go to every 
one in a heap, as afterwards also the apostles did, so that all 
heard it, whether they were believers or unbelievers. ... So also 
we must do. But we should not cast the Sacrament among the 
people in a heap. If I preach the Gospel, I do not know whom it 
strikes; but here I must be sure that it has struck him who goes 



538 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


to the Sacrament. So I must not be in doubt, but know assuredly 
that he to whom I give the Sacrament has comprehended the Gospel 
and rightly believes.” 

The doctrine of close communion must be maintained not only 
against Reformed sects, but also against Lutheran errorists. 
(Cp. Oeschichte der Luth. Eirche, by A. L. Graebner, sub Abend- 
mahl; Lehre und Wehre, 1888, pp. 257 ff. 302ff.) 

b. Of Christians only those may be admitted to the Lord’s 
Table — 

1. Who are already baptized; 

2. Who are able to examine themselves, 1 Cor. 11, 28. This 
excludes children, unconscious persons, patients in a coma, and all 
persons who are not compos mentis (insanity); 

3. Who believe that in Holy Communion they receive Christ’s 
body and blood in, with, and under the bread and wine for the 
gracious remission of their sins, Matt. 26, 26—28. This excludes 
all Reformed, rationalists, etc., who deny the real presence, as well 
as all papists (Romanizing Lutherans), who teach that the Sacra¬ 
ment works ex opere operato and so deny that faith is the medium 
Xrjmixov of the proffered forgiveness of sins; 

4. Who may do so without giving offense to others, 2 Cor. 6, 3; 
Matt. 18, 7. This excludes all those 1) who live in gross sins, 
1 Cor. 5,11; 2) who refuse to forgive and be reconciled, Matt. 18, 
15—17. 35; 5, 23. 24; and 3) who are guilty of unionism or syn¬ 
cretism, Rom. 16, 17; 2 John 10. 11. The Sacrament must be 
withheld from all who are connected with erring churches and 
unchristian or antichristian cults, Eph. 4,1—6; 5,7—11; 2 Cor. 
6, 14—18. 

Since lodgery is a pagan cult, based upon work-righteousness, 
and as such denies the very purpose of Holy Communion, namely, 
the imparting of the forgiveness of sins through faith in Christ 
(sola fide), it is self-evident that lodge-fellowship is inconsistent 
with the true profession of the Christian faith. Lodge members 
should therefore be excluded from Holy Communion a) because, as 
members of antichristian cults, they deny the specific teachings of 
the Christian religion (the Holy Trinity, the deity of Christ, 
His vicarious atonement, salvation by grace, etc.) and b) because 
they give offense to confessing Christians by going to the Lord’s 
Supper while holding membership in antichristian societies, Matt. 
10, 32—39. 

Because the Holy Supper may be received to judgment (1 Cor. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


539 


11, 29: xgifia), the Christian minister must not only urge all com¬ 
municants diligently to examine themselves, 1 Cor. 11, 28, but also 
aid them in their self-examination. To this end he should retain 
both the confessional service and the Lutheran custom of “an¬ 
nouncing for Communion” (Beichtanmeldung), which gives him 
an opportunity to deal individually with those who desire to attend 
the Lord’s Table. 

However, while the pastor should not admit to Holy Com¬ 
munion any unworthy guest, he must take care not to restrain from 
it any who are entitled to it. In general, it may be said that all 
baptized Christians who heartily repent of their sins, truly believe 
in Jesus Christ, regard the ordinance of Holy Communion as 
Christ instituted it, are open to Christian instruction on every point 
-of doctrine and life, are able to examine themselves, lead a Chris¬ 
tian life, and purpose to amend their lives by the aid of the Holy 
Spirit should be admitted to the Lord’s Table. 

Since the sacramental worthiness consists essentially in true 
faith, which this Sacrament strengthens and increases, also the 
weak in faith should be admitted to it, Matt. 11,28; John 6,37; 
in fact, these should be urged to come to the Lord’s Table. 

In all cases where the pastor, who is responsible for the con¬ 
scientious administration of his office not only to his congregation, 
but also to God, 1 Cor. 4,1. 2, would become a partaker of another 
man’s sin, 1 Tim. 5, 22, if he accepts him as a guest at the Lord’s 
Table, he is in duty bound to suspend a church-member from Holy 
Communion (cp. the case where a person refuses to be reconciled 
to his brother, Matt. 5, 23—25; 18, 28ff.; Luke 17, 3). 

Suspension from Holy Communion is not equivalent to the 
ban, or the official excommunication of the sinner by the congrega¬ 
tion, 1 Cor. 5, 13, but the pastor’s solemn declaration that the 
member in question for the time being cannot receive Holy Com¬ 
munion as a worthy guest. The suspended member may of course 
appeal from the pastor’s judgment to that of the congregation, 
but in case the congregation wrongly decides against his correct 
decision, the Christian minister should allow himself to be expelled 
from office rather than lift the suspension which he has imposed in 
accordance with God’s Word. 

While the confession (either public or private) is not divinely 
instituted, it should be retained, especially on account of the 
absolution pronounced in it. (Cp. Luther, St. L., X, 1655; 
XI, 585—590.) All other questions pertaining to this subject be¬ 
long to the domain of Pastoral Theology. 



640 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER. 


10. THE NECESSITY OF THE LORD’S SUPPER. 

While all Christians should frequently attend the Lord’s Table 
in the manner which Scripture prescribes, 1 Cor. 11,26—29, we 
cannot speak of an absolute necessity of the Lord’s Supper. The 
spiritual eating of Christ’s body, John 6, 53, or faith in Christ 
(sola fide), is indeed absolutely necessary for salvation; but the 
sacramental eating of His body is not absolutely necessary. Also 
here the words of St. Augstine apply: “Not the privation, but the 
contempt of the Sacrament condemns” (Contemptus sacramenti 
damnat, non privatio). 

However, let the Christian minister conscientiously remind his 
parishioners that indifference to, or neglect of, Communion implies 
contempt of the Sacrament and that contempt for the Lord’s insti¬ 
tutions is tantamount to apostasy. (Cp. Luther, Large Catechism, 
“The Sacrament of the Altar,” 42 ff.: “Such people as deprive 
themselves of, and withdraw from, the Sacrament so long a time 
are not to be considered Christians.”) 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


541 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN 

CHURCH. 

(De Ecclesia.) 

We shall treat this subject under two heads: a) The Church 
TJniversal; b) Local Churches. 

A. The Church Universal. 

(De Ecclesia Universal!.) 

1. DEFINITION OF THE TERM. 

Through the efficacious means of grace. Is. 55,10.11; Rom. 
10, 17, the Holy Ghost continually gathers into the kingdom of 
heaven such as truly believe that they are saved alone by faith in 
the vicarious atonement of Christ, the divine-human Savior of the 
world, Acts 2, 44—47; 5,42; 11,21; 13,48. The communion of 
believing saints which the Holy Ghost thus gathers through the 
Gospel we call the Church (rny, topp, $>np, ovvaycoytj, ixxkrjoia, 
communio sanctorum, congregatio vere credentium, coetus fide- 
lium), after the example of Scripture, Eph. 5, 24—27. The Chris¬ 
tian Church accordingly consists of all those who truly believe the 
Gospel, that is, God’s gracious message that for the sake of Christ’s 
vicarious satisfaction they freely (ydom) have forgiveness of sins, 
life, and salvation; or, more briefly expressed, who believe in 
Christ, the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world, 
John 1, 29. 

This definition of the term Church is important in view of 
the many errors that have been maintained on this point. Accord¬ 
ing to Scripture only faith in the Christ (fiducia cordis) who died 
for the sins of the world makes a person a member of the Church, 
not the external connection with a local church, nor the external 
use of the means of grace, nor the external profession of the Chris¬ 
tian faith, nor the administration of offices in visible churches, 
nor the effort to imitate Christ’s example by outwardly following 
Him, Acts 5,14. Hence the statements of our dogmaticians, Sola 
fides in Christum membra ecclesiae constituit; Christiani sunt 
ecclesia, are truly Scriptural; for only a true believer in Christ is 
a member of His holy Church, Acts 16, 31. 

It is true, as soon as a person believes in Christ, his sanctifica¬ 
tion, or renovation, begins as the inevitable effect and fruit of justi¬ 
fication, 2 Cor. 5,17.18. For this reason Holy Scripture frequently 
describes the true members of the Church according to their sane- 



542 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


tifled nature, 1 Cor. 6,15—20; 1 Pet. 2, 5, or according to the holy 
works which they do through faith, 1 Pet. 2,9—25. But the re¬ 
generate are members of the Church not inasmuch as they are sanc¬ 
tified by the Holy Ghost or inasmuch as through His power they 
bring forth fruits of faith, John 15, 4. 5, but only because they 
trust in Christ for salvation without works, Bom. 3, 28; 4, 3—5. 
In other words, as we are justified sola fide , so also we are members 
of Christ’s Church sola fide. Of justification by faith, Luther 
rightly says that this article alone begets, nurtures, builds, pre¬ 
serves, and defends the Church of God and that without it the 
Church of God cannot exist even for an hour (St. L., XIV, 168). 

From this it follows that all unbelievers and hypocrites (malt 
et hypocritae) who outwardly belong to visible churches are really 
outside the pale of the Christian Church. They are never a part 
of the Church (non sunt pars ecclesiae), although they outwardly 
hold membership in local congregations (ecclesiae admixti sunt 
secundum, societatem externam). The true members of the Church 
are joined to it through their inward, spiritual communion of faith 
with the Triune God, by reason of which they are God’s house, 
1 Tim. 3,15; God’s temple, 1 Cor. 3,9; 2 Cor. 6,16; the temple 
of the Holy Spirit, 1 Cor. 6,19; Christ’s body, Eph. 1,23; children 
of God, John 11, 52; Gal. 3,26—29; etc. On the other hand, un¬ 
believers according to Scripture are not God’s house, or temple, but 
the workshop of Satan, who “worketh in the children of disobe¬ 
dience,” Eph. 2,1—3. With respect to the definition “The Church 
is the co mm union of the elect,” which was used by Huss and com¬ 
mended by Luther (St. L., V, 1234 ff.), wc accept this as truly 
Scriptural, 1 Pet. 2, 9, since the true believers in Christ are the 
elect of God. (Baier: “Homines illi, quos Deus iuxta aeternum 
suum decretum fide et gratia sva donavit, collective sumpti dicuntur 
ecclesia Ill, 614.) 

That the Christian Church consists solely of true believers in 
Christ is a doctrine which our Lutheran Confessions firmly main¬ 
tain against the erroneous tenets of the papists: “Ecclesia est reg- 
num divinum, unicum veritatis salutisque fundamentum, a Christo- 
in orbe terrarum conditum, quod Pontifex Maximus per epi- 

SC0P08 SECUNDUM CANONES ADMINISTRAT.” 

Thus the Augsburg Confession writes (Art. VIII): “The 
Church properly is the congregation of saints and true believers.” 
The Apology (Art. VII [VIII], 5): “The Church is not only the 
fellowship of outward objects and rites, as other governments, but 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


543 


it is originally a fellowship of faith and of the Holy Ghost in 
hearts.” Again (ibid., § 16): “The Church, which is truly the 
kingdom of Christ, is properly the congregation of saints. For the 
wicked are ruled by the devil and are captives of the devil; they 
are not ruled by the Spirit of Christ.” According to the Apology 
(ibid., §§ 17—19) “the kingdom of Christ is not yet revealed, so 
that wicked men are mingled with the Church and hold offices; 
but the wicked are not the kingdom of Christ; for that is always 
the kingdom which He quickens by the Spirit.” 

The Lutheran Church thus professes the Scriptural doctrine 
that all true believers are members of the Church, while unbelievers 
are not members, even though they are outwardly joined to a visible 
church. While it sincerely believes and confesses that it is the true 
visible Church, it at the same time holds that all sincere believers 
in erring churches are truly members of Christ’s Church (ecclesia 
invisibUis). According to the Lutheran doctrine, faith is so abso¬ 
lutely the means by which a person is joined to the Church that 
not even the ban, or the excommunication from a local church, in 
case it is unjustly executed, can annul his membership in the 
Church of Christ. 

It is self-evident that such adults as have not yet been bap¬ 
tized, but have come to faith in Jesus Christ are true members 
of the Church, since Baptism is not absolutely necessary, as was 
pointed out in a previous chapter. On the other hand, it is like¬ 
wise true that a sincere believer never despises the ordinances of 
Christ, Luke 7, 29. 30, so that a true member of the Church neg¬ 
lects neither Baptism nor the Lord’s Supper. 

2. ERRONEOUS DOCTRINES CONCERNING THE CHURCH. 

It is obvious that all who err with regard to the distinctive 
doctrines of the Christian religion must err also with respect to 
the doctrine of the Church. Of all errors concerning the Church 
the foremost is that the Church is an “outward polity” (externa 
politia, “aeusserliche Polizei,” “Heilsanstalt”) “of the good and 
wicked” (Apology, VII [VIII], 13ff.), to which persons are joined 
by their external membership. 

Closely related to this error, which pertains to the essence 
(forma) of the Church, is that regarding its purpose, namely, that 
the Church is a “society for the sanctification of its members” or 
that it is an organization whose object is to save souls by means 
of good works. These basic errors are not incidental, but rather 



544 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


the result of the rejection of the fundamental Christian article of 
justification by grace, through faith. 

In fact, all who repudiate the satisfactio vicaria, the efficacy 
of the means of grace, and the sola fide must of necessity regard 
the Church as a sort of reform school in which men are to learn 
how to be good and so to merit salvation. On the other hand, the 
Biblical doctrine of the Church is built up on the central doctrine 
of justification by grace, through faith, so that it stands or falls 
with that doctrine. In particular it rests — 

a. Upon Christ's vicarious satisfaction. According to Scrip¬ 
ture the Church consists of all those who believe in the Christ who 
died for the sins of the world. All who refuse to believe this are 
outside the Church, 1 Pet. 2, 8. This doctrine is opposed by all 
rationalists (Photinians, Socinians, Unitarians, Modernists, etc.), 
who reject the doctrine of salvation by faith in Christ’s blood, 
1 John 1, 7, as an "obnoxious blood-theology” and to whom the 
Gospel of the crucified Christ is both foolishness and a stumbling- 
block, 1 Cor. 1, 23. Hence they have no other way of defining the 
Church — if they at all care for a church — than as "a free society 
of rational beings for the realization of earthly and heavenly hap¬ 
piness, conditioned by man’s religious illumination and virtue” 
(Roehrs). 

More simply defined, the Church, according to all rationalistic 
theologians, is a society of men who wish to secure happiness in 
this world and the next by means of religious devotions and other 
good works. In their estimation the Church is only a "moral or 
ethical society” and embraces as members all who are willing to 
perform the duties which it imposes. 

As all rationalists in general, so also the rationalistic papists 
in particular regard the Church as a pious society of men sancti¬ 
fying themselves by good works. According to the papistic doc¬ 
trine a person does not become a member of the Church through 
faith in Christ, but through his professed willingness to obey the 
instructions of God and the Church (Council of Trent, Sess. VI, 
Can. 20), or through the performance of good works prescribed by 
the Church (Sess. VI, Can. 32). This basic error really places the 
papists extra ecclesiam; for Scripture testifies that all who are of 
the works of the Law are fallen from grace, Gal. 5,4, and are under 
the curse, Gal. 3,10. 

The antichristian attitude of the Church of Rome is more¬ 
over proved by the fact that it has pronounced its anathema upon 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


546 


the true Christian Church, namely, upon all who believe that they 
are justified alone by grace, through faith in Christ (Council of 
Trent, Sees. VI, Cans. 11.12), defining at the same time the “true 
Church” (sc. the Roman Catholic Church) as “the congregation 
of men under the rule of duly called pastors and especially of the 
one vicar of Christ upon earth, the Roman Pontiff” (coetus homi- 
num . . . sub regimine legitimorum pastorum ac praecipue unius 
Christi in terris vicarii, Romani pontifids, Bellarmine). Officially 
Rome thus makes it impossible for its followers to be members of 
Christ’s holy Church. 

If Catholics despite the pernicious rationalism of their Church 
are members of Christ’s Church, it is because in their terrores con- 
scientiae they renounce its doctrine of work-righteousness and, 
contrary to its will and command, believe the sola fide. We there¬ 
fore recognize the papistic Church as Christian, not inasmuch as it 
rejects the Christian doctrine in its official theology (decisions and 
canons of the Council of Trent), but inasmuch as, quite incon¬ 
sistently with its general theological system, it professes the 
Apostles’ Creed, which acts as a corrective in the case of individual 
Catholics. Officially Roman Catholicism is not Christian, but 
pagan, because it professes as its cardinal dogma salvation by works. 

Since also many modern “positive” theologians (Hofmann, 
Kirn) repudiate the satisfactio vicaria, they, too, err in their defi¬ 
nition of the Christian Church. According to Kirn the Church 
is “the communion of the religious and moral life determined by 
the spirit of Christ” (Ev. Dogmatik, p. 118); that is to say, the 
communion of all who lead a moral life in the spirit of Christ. 
This, in the last analysis, reduces the Church to an “ethical society.” 

Because the Calvinists deny the gratia universalis and the 
efficacy of the means of grace as the media iustificationis, they also 
cannot define the Church rightly as the communion of all true 
believers in Christ, but must regard it theoretically as the “com¬ 
munion of the elect” and practically as the communion of all who 
possess the gratia infusa, or the immediate operation and indwelling 
of the Holy Ghost in their hearts. All true members of the Church 
in Calvinistic denominations repudiate the gratia particularis and 
in their spiritual distress hold to God’s gracious promise which He 
offers to all sinners in the Gospel. It is on account of this fact 
that they are members of Christ’s Church. 

b. Upon the doctrine of the means of grace. By this we mean 
that without the means of grace there can be no Church. Accord-

546 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


ing to the clear teaching of Scripture a person becomes a true 
member of Christ’s Church only by appropriating to himself the 
merits of Christ, Rom. 4, 3; Acts 10, 43—48. But unless the merits 
of Christ are offered to the sinner by God through His conferring 
means (the Word and the Sacraments), man cannot appropriate 
them at all. The Reformed error of “immediate grace” (Efficacious 
grace acts immediately) must be rejected as unscriptural, Rom. 10, 
13—17; Acts 2, 38. The Calvinists repudiate the means of grace 
and thus render faith and justification and consequently the exis¬ 
tence of the Church impossible. 

For the means of grace some modern “positive” theologians 
substitute the “Christian experience” (Erlebnistheologie); but the 
Bible does not recognize the Christian experience as a means of 
grace. It is rather a fruit of faith. Hence there is only one way 
in which a person may become a member of Christ’s Church, 
namely, by faith in the divine promises of grace offered in the 
Gospel and in the Sacraments, 2 Cor. 5,19—21. 

c. Upon faith as the receiving means (medium Xrjjiux6v)- 
This is evident from the fact that only those are members of the 
Church who believe in Christ, Mark 16,15.16; Acts 16,31. All 
who deny faith as the medium krjnnxdv of God’s proffered grace are 
unable to define the Church in its Biblical sense, as the communion 
of true believers. Those who regard the Sacraments as working 
ex opere operato (Romanists, Romanizing Protestants) are obliged 
to define the Church as a communion of men who, by the aid of 
the Holy Spirit, endeavor to lead a moral life; for with the rejec¬ 
tion of the sola fide only good works remain as the means of justi¬ 
fication (medium iustificationis). 

d. Upon the sola fide. This follows from what has been said 
before. The Church is the communion of true believers; but true 
believers are those only who hope to be saved by grace, through 
faith, without works, Rom. 3, 28; 4, 3—5. For this reason all 
Pelagians, Arminians, and synergists are compelled either to re¬ 
nounce their doctrine of work-righteousness or to abandon the 
Scriptural definition of the Church. The history of the Christian 
dogma proves that quite consistently they abandon the latter and 
thus regard the Church as the congregation of all who seek salva¬ 
tion by works. (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 464 ff.) That they take 
this unfortunate step is quite logical; for only those can rightly 
define the Church as the communion of believers who adhere to 
the Scriptural doctrine of justification by faith (sola gratia).

3. THE PROPERTIES OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 

(Attributa Ecclesiae.) 

According to Holy Scripture the Christian Church has certain 
undeniable characteristics for the very reason that it is the com¬ 
munion of all true believers (communio omnium, fidelium). We 
may classify these characteristics as follows: — 

a. The Church is invisible. (Ecclesia est invisibilis.) This 
follows from the fact that saving faith, which constitutes the 
means by which a person becomes and remains a member of the 
Church, is unseen of man, 1 Kings 8, 39; 19,18; Rom. 11, 3—5; 
Acts 1, 24. The invisibility of the Church is, however, predicated 
only with respect to men, not with respect to God. Of men the 
words of Christ in Luke 17,20. 21 hold; to God St. Paul’s words 
in 2 Tim. 2,19 apply (cp. John 10,14. 27. 28). 

All who affirm that the Church is either wholly (papists) or 
partly (modern Lutheran theologians) visible destroy the Scrip¬ 
tural concept of the Church and change it from a communion of 
believers to an “outward polity of the good and wicked” (externa 
politia bonorum et malorum; aeussere Anstalt; Heilsanstalt), in 
which the believers only play a more or less important r61e. 

Occasionally Lutheran theologians to-day speak of two aspects 
of the Church, a visible aspect: the Word and the Sacrame its, and 
an invisible one: the true members of the Church. But it is 
logically incorrect to describe the marks of the Church (notae 
ecclesia) as an essential part of the Church. It is true, the Gospel 
and the Sacraments are true marks of the Church; for the Church 
is never found where these are not in use. Moreover, the Gospel 
and the Sacraments are also the means by which the Church is 
established and preserved; for without the means of grace there 
can be no believers, Is. 55, lOff.; Rom. 10,17; Matt. 28,19. 20; 
Mark 16, 15. 16. But to call the means of grace a part of the 
Church or the Church itself is an absurdity. 

The Church is the communion of believers, and since the 
faith of an individual is invisible to man, we rightly say: Ecclesia 
est invisibilis. Accordingly we must regard every one who pro¬ 
fesses the Christian faith and adorns this profession with a Chris¬ 
tian life as a true member of the Church. To go beyond this and 
endeavor to ascertain the faith of an individual in any other way, 
Scripture expressly forbids, 1 Cor. 4, 5, since it is God’s prerogative 
to know them that are His, 2 Tim. 2,19; Col. 3, 3; 2 Cor. 5, 4. 5. 



548 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


Even in case we could really identify the living members of the 
Church, the communion of saints in its entirety would still be in¬ 
visible to us; for not until Judgment Day will Christ reveal His 
Church in glory, Matt. 25, 34; Col. 3, 4; 1 John 3,2. 

To the objection of the Romanists, who aver that the Church 
is “a gathering of men so visible and palpable as is that of the 
Roman people or the kingdom of Gaul or the republic of Venice” 
(Bellarmine), but that an invisible Church of true believers is 
a mere “Platonic idea” or a “figment of the mind,” we reply that 
this communion of saints is so real that God knows and lovingly 
acknowledges all its members as His, 2 Tim. 2,19; John 10,27. 28, 
preserves this Church against the gates of hell. Matt. 16,18, makes 
it the chief concern of His divine providence, Rom. 8,28; Matt. 
24, 22—24, and will finally receive it into eternal glory, Luke 12,32. 

On the other hand, the Church of Rome is not Christ’s Church 
at all, but a human organization, founded upon commandments of 
men. Matt. 15, 9, and controlled by a deceiver, whom Scripture calls 
the Antichrist and the son of perdition, 2 Thess. 2, 3. 4, so that it 
is indeed outside the true Church (extra ecclesiam) both in this 
world, Gal. 5,4; 3,10, and in that to come, Gal. 4,30. 

b. The Church is one. (Ecclesia una est.) The unity of the 
Christiau Church, which is expressly taught by Christ, John 10,16, 
is based upon its unity of faith in the one Savior, Eph. 4,3—6; for 
since the Church is the communion of believers, it is composed only 
of such as believe that they, being lost and condemned sinners, 
Rom. 3, 23. 24, are saved solely by grace, through faith in the 
atoning death of Christ, Rom. 3, 28. All who do not profess this 
Christian faith are not members of the Church, but outside the 
Church, 1 John 2, 23; 5,12; Gal. 5, 4; 3,10. Of the true mem¬ 
bers of the Church St. Paul says: “Ye are all one in Christ Jesus,” 
Gal. 3, 28, so that the statement of our dogmaticians Omnes Chris- 
tiani de evangelio consentiunt is indeed true. 

c. The Church is holy. (Ecclesia sancta est.) This is true, 
1) because all believers by faith possess Christ’s perfect righteous¬ 
ness (iustitia fidei imputata, Phil. 3, 8. 9), and 2) because through 
faith they produce holy works (iustitia vitae), Rom. 6,14. Accord¬ 
ing to the imputed righteousness (justification) believers are per¬ 
fect in the sight of God; according to their iustitia vitae they 
remain imperfect (iustitia inchoata, imperfecta) throughout their 
lives, Phil. 3,12—16. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


549 


d. The Church is universal, or catholic. (Ecclesia est univer¬ 
salis sive catholica.) This is true; for the Church embraces all 
believers at all times and in all places, Acts 10,43; John 8,56; 
Bom. 4; Gal. 3, 6 if. Even in the Old Testament the saints of God 
were such only because they believed in Christ Jesus, the promised 
Savior of the world, Rom. 3, 21. 22; 4, 3f. 

e. The Church is apostolic. (Ecclesia apostolica est.) This is 
true because all true members of the Church till the end of the world 
believe in Christ through the word of the apostles, John 17,20; 
Acts 2,42; Eph. 2,20; Rom. 16,17 f. “Apostolica dicitur eccle¬ 
sia, quod doctrinam apostolicam fide amplectitur et integram tenet." 
The Romanists and Episcopalians trace the apostolic character of 
the Church to the “apostolic succession”; but the doctrine of 
“apostolic succession” is manifestly anti-Scriptural, since Scripture 
does not draw a distinction between bishops and presbyters, or 
elders. Acts 20, 17. 28; Titus 1, 5—7. In addition, it urges all 
Christians to avoid those who teach any other doctrine than that 
taught by the blessed apostles, Rom. 16,17; Gal. 1, 6—8, even if 
they claim to possess apostolic authority, 2 Cor. 11,12—14; Gal. 
2,4f.; 2 Pet. 2,1. 2. 

f. No salvation outside the Church. (Extra ecclesiam nulla 
solus.) All who desire to be saved must be members of Christ’s 
Church. The papists apply this axiom wrongly to the Church of 
Antichrist, of which we may rather say: Intra ecclesiam nulla 
salus, namely, in so far as the members of this Church believe what 
Antichrist teaches. Rev. 13,1—9; 14, 8—12; 20,10. The axiom 
Extra ecclesiam nulla salus is true of Christ’s Church because only 
those have life and salvation who believe in the Gospel of Christ 
and through this faith are members of the Church, John 3, 
16—18. 36. The Church of Antichrist, on the other hand, makes 
salvation depend on the keeping of the Law (Council of Trent, 
Sess. VI, Can. 20) and thus leaves its members under the divine 
curse, Gal. 3,10. 

4. THE GLORY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 

The members of the Christian Church enjoy the high priv¬ 
ilege of being subject only to Christ, their divine Lord and Master, 
1 Cor. 3, 23; Matt. 23, 8, and not to any human teacher, 1 Cor. 
7,23; Matt. 15, 9. The Pope at Rome is the Antichrist for the 
very reason that he sits in the temple of God, exalting himself above 
all that is called God, 2 Thess. 2, 3. 4, that is, because he makes his 



650 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


own word the rule and standard of faith and life. It is true, God 
at all times bestows special gifts upon certain members of the 
Church and calls these as teachers of their fellow-believers, Eph. 
4,11—13. But such teachers of the Church are to inculcate only 
His Word, 1 Pet. 4,11; Jer. 23,16.18, and not their own. 

According to Scripture all teachers who preach their own word 
and doctrine are “proud know-nothings,” or “conceited dolts,” 
whom the Church should reject and shun as perverters and cor¬ 
rupters, 1 Tim. 6, 3—5, indeed, as seducing spirits, teaching doc¬ 
trines of devils, 1 Tim. 4, 1—3; Col. 2, 18—23. Even the holy 
apostles did not command obedience in so far as they were human 
beings, 1 Cor. 3, 21—23, blit their word must be heard and heeded 
solely because of its being God’s Word, given by divine inspiration, 
1 Cor. 4,1 ; 2,12.13. 

Christian ministers are not mediators between God and the 
believers (priests); for all Christians have access to God’s throne 
through the one Mediator, Christ, in whom they believe, Rom. 
6,1. 2; Eph. 3,12; Heb. 4,16. In fact, all believers are the imme¬ 
diate possessors of all gifts and blessings which Christ has secured 
for His Church, such as the means of grace and the keys of the 
kingdom of heaven. Matt. 16,19; 18,18; John 20,23; 1 Cor. 5, 
3—5.13. Theirs alone is the privilege to preach the Gospel and to 
administer the Sacraments, in short, to execute the entire Office 
of the Keys, so that the called and ordained pastors exercise their 
ministerial functions only in the name of the church which has 
called them. 

To the objection of the Romanists that in Matt. 16,18 Christ 
builds His Church on Peter, Luther rightly replies that “all Chris¬ 
tians are Peters on account of the confession of Christ which Peter 
here made; this confession is the rock upon which Peter and all 
Peters are built.” The above words of our Lord cannot be referred 
to the person of Peter either as the primary apostle or as the repre¬ 
sentative of the apostles; for, as the context shows, Peter here did 
not act as an apostle at all, but only as a believing Christian. 
That not Peter himself was meant to be the rock upon which the 
Church is built, but his Christian confession, is unmistakably indi¬ 
cated by the words of the text ( IHxqos, nirtga). 

Luther is right in saying that in this passage Christ clearly 
distinguishes between Peter and his confession; for had He meant 
to make Peter the rock of the Church, He should have said: “Thou 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


561 


art Peter, and upon thee will I build My Church.” (Cp. Luther, 
St.L., XX, 282; XVIII, 1375 ff.) 

Among modem Protestant exegetes some (e. g., Meyer) refer 
the term nhga to the person of Peter, as if this apostle were here 
given the primacy among the apostles (primus inter pares), though 
they deny the conclusions which the papists draw from this premise 
with reference to the Roman Pontiff. Other modem exegetes 
rightly refer the words to Peter’s confession (Lange, Ewald, 
Wieseler). 

Whether the temi nexga refers to Christ Himself or to the 
confession of Christ is immaterial, since the Church that is built 
upon the confession of Christ is built upon Christ Himself. 

As believers possess all spiritual gifts and blessings of God 
in Christ Jesus, so they possess also all temporal gifts and blessings 
of God, so that indeed all things present and things to come are 
theirs, 1 Cor. 3, 21—23, as children of God and coheirs with Christ, 
Rom. 8,14—17. 

5. HOW THE CHURCH IS FOUNDED AND PRESERVED. 

Since saving faith, by which a person becomes a member of 
the Church, is solely the work of God, Eph. 1,19. 20; 1 Pet. 1,5; 
John 1,13, the Church owes its existence and preservation entirely 
to divine grace, Ps. 100, 3; 1 Pet. 2, 9.10. 

Synergism, which makes man’s faith depend in part on his 
meritorious efforts, therefore undermines the very foundation of 
the Church. 

The means, or instrument, by which God gathers and sustains 
His Church is the Gospel in all its various forms of application 
(the Word and the Sacraments), through which the Holy Ghost 
engenders and preserves faith, Rom. 10,13—17; 1 Pet. 1, 23—25. 
(Cp. Luther, St.L., V, 990ff.; VI, 21 ff.) 

Calvinism, which denies the efficacy of the means of grace and 
teaches the creation of faith by the immediate operation of the 
Holy Spirit, therefore removes the very foundation on which the 
Church rests. Fortunately the practise of Calvinists is more Scrip¬ 
tural than is their theory; for, unlike the consistent Quakers, they 
use and apply the means of grace; that is to say, they preach the 
Gospel and retain the Sacraments, though not in their Scriptural 
purity. 

Believers are instrumental causes (causae instrumentales) of 



652 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


the Church inasmuch as they preach the Gospel and administer the 
Sacraments, Is. 40,9; Mark 16,15.16; Matt. 28,20. 

In this sense the visible Church on earth is the mother of all 
believers (mater fidelium), who like Isaac are children of the 
promise, Gal. 4,26—28. Luther thus declares (St. L., IX, 573ff., 
especially 575if.): “Sarah, or Jerusalem, is our free mother, 
namely, the Church, Christ’s bride, by which we all are born. But 
she bears children without ceasing till the end of the world by 
the ministry of the Word, that is, by teaching and spreading the 
Gospel; for that is what to bear means. The Church should do 
nothing else than teach the Gospel in its truth and purity and thus 
bear children.” 

From this follows that the State (civil government) is not 
a sort of maid (ancilla ecclesiae) that must assist the Church in its 
divine work of winning souls for Christ. While both the papists 
and the Calvinists intermingle Church and State in principle and 
practise, the Lutherans, on the basis of Scripture, oppose every 
attempt to mingle the two. According to Lutheran doctrine the 
mingling of the two produces only harm, never any good (cp. 
church conditions in all European state churches). The Church 
loses nothing of its dignity or power by being independent of the 
civil government. On the contrary, its freedom from the restric¬ 
tions of the civil law enables it to attend to its sacred duty of 
proclaiming the Word the more efficiently. 

On the other hand, however, the independent constitution of 
the Church (die freikirchliche Verfassung) must not be interpreted 
as a sort of means of grace, which in itself makes it more effective 
in saving souls. Its success depends entirely on the testimony of 
the Gospel in its full truth and the administration of the Sacra¬ 
ments according to Christ’s institution. That is both its privilege 
and its power. 

With regard to the existing forms of government (absolute 
monarchies; limited monarchies; republics; Zwingli favored the 
republic; Calvin the oligarchy) the Augsburg Confession (Art. 
XVI) rightly affirms: “The Gospel teaches an eternal righteous¬ 
ness of the heart. Meanwhile it does not destroy the State or the 
family, but very much requires that they be preserved as ordinances 
of God and that charity be practised in such ordinances. There¬ 
fore Christians are necessarily bound to obey their own magistrates 
and laws, save only when commanded to sin; for then they ought 
to obey God rather than men, Acts 5,29.” The Augsburg Confes- 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


553 


sion does not favor any particular form of government, but teaches 
that Christians must acknowledge, and be subject to, all "powers 
that be,” Rom. 13, 1—7; Matt. 22, 21; 1 Pet. 2, 13. 17; 1 Tim. 
2,1—3; Jer. 29, 7. 

While Christian believers who have been chosen to fill govern¬ 
mental offices must not conceal or deny their faith, but as earnest 
Christians witness the more faithfully to the truth of the Gospel, 
Acts 17, 34; Rom. 16, 23, wherever they have an opportunity, 
nevertheless they must carefully distinguish between the provinces 
of the Church and of the State, bearing in mind, on the one hand, 
that the State cannot be governed by God’s Word or "Christian 
principles,” but only by reason and common sense (lex naturalis), 
while, on the other, the Church is governed alone by God’s Word 
and not by any dictates of reason or by the external coercion of 
laws. In other words, though Christians should put into the ser¬ 
vice of Christ also the influence which is theirs because of their 
high station in life, just as they so use their money and other 
talents, they must not intermingle the Church and the State in 
the interest of either of the two. 

During the Reformation the prevailing conditions prevented 
Luther from carrying into effect his clear principle regarding the 
separation of Church and State; yet he never ceased to declare 
this principle as the only correct and Scriptural one. (Cp. Christl. 
Dogmatik, III, 481 f.) 

B. Concerning Local Churches. 

(De Ecclesiis P&rtlcularibus.) 

1. DEFINITION OF THE TERM. 

What has been said so far related to the Church Universal, 
or to the Church in its primary sense, namely, the "one fold,” 
John 10,16, or the communion of believers. Matt. 16,18, which the 
Holy Ghost continuously gathers through the preaching of the 
Gospel, Rom. 11, 2—5. However, Scripture applies the term 
Church also to local congregations, 1 Cor. 16, 19; 1, 2; 11, 16; 
Acts 8, 1; Rom. 16, 16, which therefore are known as local 
churches (ecclesiae particulares). Such local churches are assem¬ 
blies of believers, or Christians grouped together at one place, to 
preach the Gospel and administer the Sacraments, in short, to exe¬ 
cute the Office of the Keys, Acts 20, 28; 14, 23. 27; 1 Tim. 3, 5; 
Matt. 18,17; 1 Cor. 14,23. 



554 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


With respect to the relation between the Church Universal and 
the local churches, Scripture teaches clearly that these are not two 
different churches or two different kinds of churches, but the Church 
Universal consists of all true believers who are found in the local 
churches. Since it is God’s will that all believers should be joined 
to local churches, all cases where an individual believer on account 
of special circumstances temporarily does not hold membership in 
a local church must be regarded as exceptional and hence require 
no consideration in this connection. Local churches therefore are 
true believers, or true members of the Church Universal, who are 
joined together in a visible communion for the purpose of executing 
the Office of the Keys, or the peculiar church-power which Christ 
has given to His Church on earth. This point must be clearly 
understood; for local churches, in the proper sense of the term, 
consist only of true believers. 

All hypocrites, who are not members of the Church Universal, 
are likewise not truly members of local churches, Matt. 24, 32; 
22,12—14; 20,10—16; 13,47—48. Their connection with the 
local churches is only external and accidental. Accordingly, when 
St. Paul addressed the local church at Corinth (“the church of God 
which is at Corinth”), he addressed its members as “those that are 
sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all that in 
every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord,” 
1 Cor. 1, 2. This description certainly does not apply to the hypo¬ 
crites (mali et hypocritae) who were joined to the church outwardly 
(ecclesiae admixti secundum societatem extemam). 

Again, when hypocrites manifest themselves as such, Christ 
distinctly commands that they should be excommunicated, Matt. 
18,15—18; for since they are not members of the Church, they 
should not disgrace or injure the local congregation by their 
presence, 1 Cor. 5, 6—13. 

Lastly, all the divinely imposed obligations of the local 
churches presuppose that those who fulfil them are true believers; 
for these Christian duties can be performed rightly only by persons 
who are truly regenerate; e. g., mutual instruction and admonition, 
Col. 3, 16. 17; church discipline, Matt. 18, 15—18; 1 Cor. 5, 
1—13; preservation of the true doctrine and spiritual guardian¬ 
ship over the teachers, Rom. 16, 17; Col. 4, 17; preaching the 
Gospel, 1 Pet. 2, 9; Christian conduct in the fear of God, 1 Pet. 3, 
8—17; etc. Before hypocrites can become members of the local 
churches, they must first “repent and be converted,” Acts 3,19. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


555 


We therefore rightly define local churches as assemblies of 
true believers, who are gathered at a certain place for the purpose 
of preaching the Gospel and administering the Sacraments. If in 
a general way we apply the term also to heterodox congregations 
or even to antichristian cults, this is done in a wider sense, either 
by way of synecdoche, because also in heterodox local churches 
there may be members of the Church Universal, or improperly 
(improprie), i. e., according to the common mode of speaking 
(unchristian cults). 

2. THE DIVINE INSTITUTION OF LOCAL CHURCHES. 

The question whether local churches exist by divine institu¬ 
tion or command, so that believers living at one place must either 
organize such churches where they do not exist or join them where 
they do exist, is of great importance. 

To the objection of those who deny this point on the ground 
that membership in the Church Universal is sufficient for salva¬ 
tion and that Christ has given His followers no direct command 
to establish or to join local churches, so that local churches are free 
organizations, founded by men as the practical needs of believers 
in this world have made them necessary, we reply that it is indeed 
God’s will and appointment — 

a) That all believers living at one place should establish in 
their midst the public ministry and make diligent use of it by 
hearing and learning God’s Word as it is proclaimed by the divinely 
called ministers, Eph. 4, 3—6; Acts 2, 42—47; 14, 23; 20, 28; 
1 Cor. 12, 28; 1 Pet. 5, 2. 3; Titus 1, 5; 

b) That they should together celebrate Holy Communion, 
1 Cor. 11,26; 10,17, and exercise the duties of Christian fellow¬ 
ship and love, 1 Cor. 11, 33; 1,10; Acts 6,1—6; Col. 3,15. 16; 

c) That they should not only privately reprove an erring 
brother, Matt. 18, 15. 16, but also as a church, or congregation, 
rebuke and discipline impenitent sinners. Matt. 18,17; 1 Cor. 5,13. 

From all this it follows that it is indeed God’s will and ordi¬ 
nance that Christians should establish and maintain local churches; 
for without them these Christian obligations, enjoined so definitely, 
cannot be performed. 

This principle is in full accord with the practise of the apostles 
and their followers, who consistently gathered the believers into 
local churches and commonly instructed, admonished, and com¬ 
forted them as such in their epistles, 1 Cor. 1,2; Rom. 1, 7; Gal. 



556 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


1, 2; Eph. 1, 1; Phil. 1, 1; Acts 20, 28; 14, 23; 1 Cor. 5, 13; 
2 Cor. 2, 6—8; Titus 1, 5; Rev. 1—3. ^ 

For this reason we rightly insist that the ban excommuni¬ 
cation, Matt. 18, 17; 1 Cor. 5, 13, should be declared by local 
churches and not by assemblies of Christians which have not been 
divinely instituted. Among such bodies we may classify all con¬ 
ferences, synods, and similar convocations which are established for 
the furtherance of Christ’s kingdom and cause. Yet even with 
respect to synods, conferences, and similar organizations, Christians 
must always be guided by the rule of Christian love, 2 Cor. 13,11; 
1 Cor. 16,14; Rom. 13,10. 

3. ORTHODOX AND HETERODOX CHURCHES. 

It is God’s will and command that all believers should hear, 
learn, and proclaim only the pure Word which He Himself has 
given them in Holy Scripture, Jer. 23, 30—32; 1 Tim. 6, 3—5. 
All who pervert the Word of God and teach their own doctrine in 
place of God’s revealed truths, Matt. 15, 9, Scripture condemns as 
false prophets, Matt. 7,15, teachers, both of fables and of damnable 
heresies, 1 Tim. 1, 3—7; 2 Pet. 2,1, ungodly men, Jude 3. 4, men 
of corrupt minds and reprobate concerning the faith, 2 Tim. 3, 
1—8, deceivers and antichrists, 2 John 7, whom all Christians must 
avoid, Rom. 16,17; 2 John 10, as conceited ignoramuses, 1 Tim. 6, 
3—5, who are under God’s curse, Gal. 1, 8, etc. As Holy Scripture 
condemns all sinful conduct, 1 Cor. 5, 9—11; Rev. 21, 8; 22,15, 
so it likewise condemns every corruption of the Christian faith, as 
this is set forth in God’s Word, Gal. 3,10; 5,10—12; Rev. 22, 
18.19; Matt. 18, 6. 7; 5,19. 

All churches that tolerate and follow such perverters of the 
divine truth are known as heterodox churches (ecclesiae hetero- 
doxae, ecclesiae impurae), while churches that teach the Word of 
God in its truth and purity and administer the Sacraments accord¬ 
ing to Christ’s institution are orthodox, or pure, churches (ecclesiae 
orthodoxae, ecclesiae purae). 

This distinction all sincere Christians must carefully observe, 
especially at this time, when the spirit of indifferentism is alarm¬ 
ingly spreading in so many churches and there is a manifest ten¬ 
dency to discard the Christian doctrine (abrogation of creeds) and 
to reorganize the churches on a “broader basis of social service” 
(applied Christianity; the gospel of social service). The program 
of present-day Modernism calls for the abolition of every confes- 



THE DOOTBINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


657 


sional basis and is therefore in opposition to the direct commission 
which Christ gave to His Church, Mark 16, 15; Matt. 28, 20; 
10, 32—39. 

In order that believers may rightly distinguish between ortho¬ 
dox and heterodox churches, the following points must be kept 
in mind. 

In the first plaoe, a church is orthodox, or pure (ecclesia vera 
seu pura), not simply when it acknowledges the divine truth in 
general through confessions which are in accord with Scripture, 
but when it actually teaches the divine truth without qualification 
and prevents or suppresses all error. In other words, a church must 
be pure, or orthodox, not only in principle, but also in practise, so 
that it earnestly reproves and disciplines all who teach false 
doctrine. But this is not all. If a church wishes to be truly 
orthodox, it must not only teach in conformity with Scripture, but 
also insist upon a practise that is in strict accord with whatever the 
Word of God inculcates (conditions of church-membership, atten¬ 
dance at Holy Communion, regulation of the Christian life of its 
members, opposition to religious indifferentism and unionism, etc.). 
A church which is orthodox in theory only, but not in practise 
cannot be considered as being truly orthodox, since it disre¬ 
gards Holy Scripture in its insistence upon the proper application 
of the divine truth to life, 1 Cor. 5, 13; 11, 20—22; 6, 1—6; 
14, 34—40; etc. 

In the second place, an orthodox church does not become 
heterodox (ecclesia corrupta) through errors which accidentally 
occur in its midst; for it is only the toleration of false doctrine 
and an unscriptural practise that make a church heterodox. Even 
in the churches established by the apostles, errorists arose, who 
succeeded in spreading false doctrines, Acts 20, 30; Gal. 1, 6—9; 
1 Cor. 15,1—19; but they were reproved and condemned. 

Hence a church becomes impure, or heterodox, only when it 
ceases to apply God’s directions given in Rom. 16, 17; 2 John 
10.11; Matt. 18,17; etc., and so permits error and ungodliness 
to exist side by side with truth or even to gain the ascendency 
over truth. 

Heterodox churches are sects, inasmuch as they adhere to error, 
which separates them from the Church. " Ecclesia quatenus im- 
pura, non est ecclesia” They are churches inasmuch as they still 
adhere to the Christian truth and are thus joined to the Church, 
provided, of course, their errors do not deny the fundamental 



558 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


articles of the Christian faith, in which case they cease to be 
heterodox churches and become antichristian cults (cp. Calvinism 
with Unitarianism; 1 Tim. 6, 20. 21; 2 Tim. 2,16—18). 

Although heterodox churches, in the common sense of the term, 
still adhere to the fundamentals of the Christian faith and so 
harbor true believers in their midst, nevertheless all Christians who- 
recognize their error are in duty bound to sever their connection 
with them, since, on the one hand, one error is bound to produce 
others, Gal. 5, 9, and, on the other, the toleration of a recognized 
falsehood is a denial of the divine truth, Matt. 10, 32—36, and this 
is incompatible with the true Christian profession, Rom. 16, 17; 
2 Cor. 6,14—18. 

4. HETERODOX CHURCHES AND TRUE DISCIPLESHIP. 

Heterodox churches do not exist by the will of God, Matt. 
28, 20, but against His will, Jer. 23, 29—40; 1 Cor. 3, 16—17. 
God permits them to exist partly to prove the faith of His true 
disciples, 1 Cor. 11,19, and partly to punish the indifferentism, in¬ 
gratitude, and infidelity of the ungodly, 2 Thess. 2,11.12. 

Hence Christians should view the existence of heterodox 
churches not with indifference, but with horror, since every error 
is an offense ( oxavdalov ), which not only provokes God to anger, 
Deut. 32, 5. 6; 28,15—68, but also endangers the salvation of all 
who are brought into contact with it, 1 Cor. 15, 33; 2 Tim. 2,16.17. 

Nevertheless true believers may be found even in heterodox 
churches, not inasmuch as they are heterodox, — for falsehood 
always opposes itself to saving faith, — but inasmuch as by the 
grace of God they still retain the fundamentals of the Gospel. 

Our Savior Himself, while denouncing the religion and worship 
of the Samaritans, John 4, 22, still acknowledged the true disciple- 
ship of individual believing Samaritans, Luke 17,16; 10,33. So 
also Luther, though he condemned the Papacy as an institution 
founded by the devil, still recognized true believers (the baptized 
children; adults who adhered to the sola gratia against the teach¬ 
ings of the Pope) also in this corrupted Church. Similarly the 
great Reformer held that there were true believers among the fol¬ 
lowers of Zwingli and Calvin because they adhered to them in igno¬ 
rance. (St. L., IX, 44.) 

The confessional Lutheran Church, though ever insisting upon 
the prerogative of being the true orthodox Church, has never iden¬ 
tified itself with the una sancta ecclesia, extra quam nulla est solus. 



THE DOCTRINE OP THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


559 


but has always taught that the Church Universal is the com¬ 
munion of all believers who put their hope of salvation alone 
in Christ’s vicarious atonement. (Cp. Walther, Kirche und Amt, 
pp. 95—113; 160ff.) Dr. Walther writes: “Whoever binds sal¬ 
vation to membership in any visible Church annuls the article of 
justification by grace alone, through faith in Christ.” 

5. THE INADMISSIBILITY OF SPIRITUAL FELLOWSHIP 
WITH HETERODOX CHURCHES. 

(Religious Unionism.) 

What has just been said should not lead any one to regard 
religious unionism (syncretism, TJnionismus, Religionsmengeret) 
as permissible, much less as laudable. The words “with charity 
toward all” apply indeed to all men, for Christians are commanded 
to love all men, Matt. 22, 39; 5, 44; 1 John 3,17.18; but they do 
not mean that Christians should countenance false prophets and 
their errors, Matt. 7,15; Gal. 1, 8. 9. The direction of Scripture 
with regard to this point is both clear and emphatic, Rom. 16,17; 
Gal. 5, 9; 2 John 10. 11; Titus 3, 9—11; 1 Tim. 1, 3—7; 2 Cor. 
6,14—18. 

To the objection that religious unionism may be justified both 
because of the principle of Christian charity, Rom. 13,10; 1 Cor. 
13, 7, and in view of Christ’s earnest prayer that all believers may 
be one, John 17, 20. 21, we reply — 

a) That it is indeed only a caricature of Christian love to 
permit any one to grope in spiritual darkness and to endanger his 
soul’s salvation, 2 Cor. 5,13—15; 1 Cor. 9, 22. 23; 2 Cor. 6, 3—10, 
so that religious unionism, which in the last analysis is carnal in- 
differentism, really ignores true Christian love both toward God 
(faithfulness to His Word) and toward the neighbor (conscientious 
interest in his avowal of the divine truth); 

b) That the unity which the Holy Ghost Himself works 
through the Word is the unity of faith, John 17,17. 20. 21. 25. 26; 
Eph. 4, 3—6; 1 Cor. 1, 10, which Christians must foster by wit¬ 
nessing to the truth. 

True unity of faith is indeed commanded by God, 1 Cor. 1,10, 
and all Christian believers should therefore do all in their power 
to effect it. But this unity, which is of the Spirit, is neither estab¬ 
lished nor furthered by carnal indifferentism and toleration of 
error, 2 Cor. 6,14—18; 1 Kings 18, 21. 22. 40. 



560 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


The peril that lurks in religious unionism is that by an un¬ 
fortunate consistency in the profession of falsehood one error 
always produces another. So also carnal indifferentism toward one 
doctrine is bound to produce carnal indifferentism towards others. 
Luther says (St. L., XVII, 1180): “Whoever regards his doc¬ 
trine, faith, and confession as true, right, and certain cannot 
stand in one stall with others that teach or favor false doctrine.” 
(Cp. XVIII, 1996.) 

The contention of modern rationalistic theologians that the 
“various theological tendencies” (denominational divisions) are 
intended by God is neither Scriptural nor reasonable. 

6. SEPARATISTS, OR SCHISMATICS. 

The term separatism, or schism, denotes a denominational 
separation of religious groups from existing churches on non- 
Scriptural grounds, such as ecclesiastical customs, forms, usages, 
and the like (Donatism). Schisms are therefore opposed to God’s 
Word and are sinful. For practical reasons we distinguish between 
malicious separatism (schismatici malitiosi) and non-malicious 
separatism (schismatici non-mdlitiosi). The former is caused by, 
and mingled with, spite and uncharitableness; the latter is the 
result of ignorance or prejudice and is not joined with intentional 
disregard of the principle of brotherly love. 

To apply the terms separatists and schismatics to persons who 
separate themselves from erring churches on account of their un¬ 
sound doctrine or unscriptural practise is unjustified. 

With regard to the right use of the doctrine of the Church, 
the Lutheran Catechism gives the following important directions. 
We use the doctrine of the Church properly, a) when we take heed 
to be and remain members of the invisible Church, 2 Cor. 13, 5; 
John 8, 31. 32; b) when we to this end adhere to the Church of the 
pure Word and confession and avoid all false churches, Matt. 7,15; 
1 John 4,1; Eom. 16,17; 2 Cor. 6,14—18; and c) when we con¬ 
tribute toward its maintenance and propagation according to our 
ability, 1 Cor. 9, 14; Gal. 6, 6. 7; 1 Tim. 5, 17. 18; 1 Thess. 5, 
12.13; Mark 16,15.16; Matt. 28, 19. 20. These points deserve 
the constant consideration of every Christian believer and should 
be inculcated most diligently by the pastor in both his public and 
his private instruction. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


561 


7. THE REPRESENTATIVE CHURCH. 

(De Ecclesia Repraesentativa.) 

Neither individual persons (Popes, princes, presidents) nor 1 
assemblies (church councils, synods, pastoral conferences, parlia¬ 
ments, consistories) have been ordained by our Lord to decide 
questions of faith or church polity. For all questions of doctrine, ! 
Scripture is the only source and norm, 1 Pet. 4,11, while questions j 
pertaining to the external management of the churches are adi- j 
aphora, Acts 4, 32; 15, 22—29; 1,15—26, which must be decided I 
in brotherly love according to the principle of Christian order and 
expediency, 1 Cor. 14,40. | 

The Pope’s claim that he is Christ’s vicar on earth, whose 
decisions on doctrine and life are binding on all Christian con¬ 
sciences (Papa habet omnia iura in scrinio pectoris) proves him to 
be Antichrist, 2 Thess. 2, 3. 4. Equally condemnable is the ambi¬ 
tion of earthly rulers to prescribe to the Church (Caesaropapism). 

However, it is not contrary to Scripture to have Christian be¬ 
lievers, in certain ecclesiastical affairs, represented by persons duly 
elected by them. Thus elders may represent local congregations, 
and special delegates may represent entire groups of local churches 
at synods or conferences. But such a representative Church 
(ecclesia repraesentativa) has only so much authority as has been 
delegated to it by the express declaration of the local churches 
which it represents. In itself it has not legislative, but only ad¬ 
visory power; that is to say, what the representative Church de¬ 
cides must be in agreement with the will of the churches which 
it represents and must always be ratified by them. 

In accord with this principle the Constitution of the Missouri 
Synod declares with respect to the relation of Synod to the local 
churches (chap. IV): “So far as the self-government of the local 
churches is concerned. Synod is only an advisory body.” This 
declaration rests upon the correct, Scriptural principle that the 
local church is divinely appointed and is vested not only with the 
Office of the Keys, but with supreme authority to direct all matters 
pertaining to church polity, Matt. 18,15—18; 1 Cor. 5,11—13; 

14, 33—36. (Cp. Luther, St. L., IX, 12531; X, 1540ff.; XIX, 
958 ff.; Christl. Dogmatik, III, 492—501.) 

Hence there is no ecclesia repraesentativa in the sense that 
either the clergy or church councils or synods or church conventions 
have authority to “determine controversies of faith and cases of 

36 


CHRISTIAN* DOGMATICS. 



562 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 


conscience; to set down rules and directions for the better ordering 
of the public worship of God and government of His Church, . . . 
which decrees and determinations, if consonant to the Word of 
God, are to be received with reverence and submission, not only 
for their agreement with the Word, but also for the power whereby 
they are made, as being an ordinance of Ood, appointed thereunto 
in His Wordr (Presbyterian Confession of Faith, XXXI). 

Synods and councils which arrogate to themselves such 
authority imitate the papistic practise and set aside the rights and 
privileges of the local church, which is indeed “an ordinance of 
God, appointed thereunto in His Word.” 

Once more, however, let us repeat that local churches have 
authority neither to set aside God’s Word nor to offend against 
Christian love. In all matters of doctrine and life they are bound 
to Holy Scripture, and in all cases of church management or church 
polity (adiaphora) their supreme concern must be the highest wel¬ 
fare of the Church, Christian love being the deciding factor in all 
disputes or differences of opinion. 

Synods and councils (Presbyterians, Methodists, Episcopa¬ 
lians) are not a sort of superchurch, but it is the local church that 
is supreme, because it is an ordinance of Christ. All other ques¬ 
tions on this point belong to the domain of Pastoral Theology. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


503 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 

(De Ministerlo Ecclesiastic©.) 


1. DEFINITION OF THE TERM. 

The term ministry (Predigtamt, ministerium) is used both by 
Scripture and the Church in a wider and a narrower sense. In its 
general sense the word denotes every manner of proclaiming 
the Gospel or of administering the means of grace, no matter 
whether this is done by Christians in general, to whom the means 
of grace have been divinely entrusted, or by called and ordained 
ministers of the Word (ministri ecclesiae) in the name of the 
Christian congregation (Pfarramt). 

Accordingly we speak of the Christian ministry in the abstract 
(in abstracto), that is, distinct from the persons who administer it, 
and in the concrete (in concreto), or as it is vested in called and 
ordained pastors, who perform its duties in the name of the local 
congregations. In this special, or narrow, sense we employ the 
term ministry in this discussion (Pfarramt; Predigtamt im 
engeren Sinn). 

The Christian ministry in its narrow sense (in concreto) 
presupposes the existence of local churches, for it certainly can 
be established only where such congregations exist. In this sense 
the Smalcald Articles (Of the Power and Primacy of the Pope, 
§67) aptly say: “Wherever the Church is, there is the authority 
[command] to administer the Gospel. Therefore it is necessary 
for the Church [German: die Kirchen ] to retain the authority 
to call, elect, and ordain ministers. . . . Wherever there is a true 
church, the right to elect and ordain ministers necessarily exists.” 

The Smalcald Articles voice the clear doctrine of Holy Scrip¬ 
ture on this point. When St. Paul had founded Christian churches 
on the island of Crete, he commanded Titus (Titus 1, 5) to ordain 
elders, whom in v. 7 he calls bishops (imoxdnovg'), in every city 
(xaxa ndXiv), that is, in every city where there were local churches. 
Again, after St. Paul and Barnabas had established local churches 
in Asia Minor on their first missionary journey, they, on their 
return trip, “ordained them elders (jiqeo^vxeqov<;) in every church 
(xaz’ IxxXrjoiav), commending them to the Lord, on whom they 
believed,” Acts 14, 23. Elders so ordained were expressly com¬ 
manded to “take care of the church of God,” 1 Tim. 3, 5; to “take 
heed to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made them 



564 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


overseers,” Acts 20,28; to “feed the Church of God,” v. 28 b; to 
“watch . . . and warn every one night and day,” v. 31; to be “en- 
samples to the flock,” 1 Pet. 5, 3; etc. In short, they were to serve 
as divinely appointed pastors in their congregations. 

Hence we rightly say that the office of the Christian ministry 
(das christliche Pfarramt) is of divine appointment or command. 
So also the Apology says (Art. XIII, 11) : “The ministry of the 
Word has God’s command and glorious promises.” Gerhard writes: 
“The ministry of the Church is a sacred and public office by divine 
appointment." (XIII, 224.) And Hutter: “The ministry of the 
Church has been established . . . by God Himself.” (Loc. Th., 186.) 
(Cp. Doctr. Theol., p. 606 ff.) 

The Christian ministry is called “public,” not in view of 
the place, where its functions are performed, but rather in view 
of the fact that its functions are executed in the name and by the 
authority of the congregation, so that even such functions of the 
ministerial office as are done in private (private Communion; 
private admonition; private absolution) belong to the public min¬ 
istry (cp. public service; public servants, etc.). So, then, the 
divine rule obtains: Wherever true believers are found at one place, 
they must organize and maintain local churches. And wherever 
there are local churches, they must also by God’s will call official 
pastors or ministers, who in the name of the congregation preach 
the Gospel and administer the Sacraments, or who in the name of 
the congregation execute the Office of the Keys. (Cp. Luther, 
St. L., Ill, 723.) 

2. THE PUBLIC MINISTRY AND THE SPIRITUAL 
PRIESTHOOD OF ALL BELIEVERS. 

It is self-evident that the public ministry (das Pfarramt) does 
not stand in opposition to the general ministry (spiritual priest¬ 
hood) of all believers, who as spiritual priests have the duty to 
proclaim the Gospel throughout the world, 1 Pet. 2, 9. The office 
of the public ministry rather presupposes the spiritual priesthood 
of all believers; for, on the one hand, the called ministers of the 
Word must themselves be spiritual priests, or true believers, 1 Tim. 
3, 2—7; Titus 1, 5—9; and, on the other, they publicly, that is, in 
the name of the believers who have called them, administer the 
duties and privileges which all Christians have as spiritual priests. 

The relation between the public ministry and the spiritual 
priesthood of all believers is therefore obvious. That the two are 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


565 


not identical follows from the fact that Scripture sharply distin¬ 
guishes between believers in general and shepherds, bishops, or 
elders (ministers) who are placed over the believer. Thus — 

a) All believers are to know and to profess the divine truth, 
John 6, 45; 7, 38. 39; 1 Cor. 2, 15. 16; 1 John 2, 27; 1 Pet. 
2, 9; Col. 3,16; but the official teachers of the Church must pos¬ 
sess a preeminent knowledge of divine truth and a special aptitude 
to teach, 1 Tim. 3,1—7; 5,22; Titus 1,5—11. 

b) While Holy Scripture teaches that all believers are charged 
with the duties and enjoy the privileges of the Office of the Keys, 
Matt. 18,17; 1 Cor. 5,18, it expressly declares, on the one hand, 
that God gives to the Church apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, 
and teachers for the work of the ministry, Eph. 4,11.12; 1 Cor. 
12,28; Acts 20,28, and, on the other, that not all believers are 
apostles, prophets, teachers, 1 Cor. 12, 29; Jas. 3, 1 (iiddaxakoi). 

c) While Holy Scripture declares that “the manifestation of 
the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,” 1 Cor. 12,4—12, 
and that all the members of Christ’s body should therefore have 
abundant honor, 1 Cor. 12, 23—25, it demands that the official 
teachers of the Church be especially esteemed as such as speak the 
Word of God, Heb. 13, 7; that they which preach the Gospel should 
live of the Gospel, 1 Cor. 9,14; that he who is taught in the Word 
should communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things, 
Gal. 6, 6. 7; that the elders that rule well be counted worthy of 
double honor, especially they who labor in the Word and doctrine, 
1 Tim. 5, 17. 18; that believers should know them which labor 
among them and are over them in the Lord and admonish them, 
1 Thess. 5,12.13; and that Christians should obey them that have 
the rule over them and watch over their souls as they that must 
give account, Heb. 13,17. 

d) Lastly, when St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians: “Let 
a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and stewards 
of the mysteries of God,” 1 Cor. 4,1, he referred not only to him¬ 
self, but also to Apollos, 1 Cor. 4, 6, and his other fellow-laborers 
in the Word, 1 Cor. 3, 21. 

We therefore rightly distinguish between believers as spiritual 
priests and believers as called ministers of Christ and stewards of 
God’s mysteries. 

No one distinguished between the spiritual priesthood of all 
believers and the public ministry more clearly than did Luther. 



566 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


On the one hand, he writes (St. L., V, 1038): “As soon as we have 
become Christians through this Priest [Christ] and His priesthood 
and in Baptism through faith have been engrafted into Him, we 
have the right and authority to teach and confess the Word, which 
we have from Him, before everybody, every one according to his 
calling and station. For though we are not all in the public office 
or calling, still every Christian should teach, instruct, exhort, com¬ 
fort, and reprove his neighbor through God’s Word whenever and 
wherever any one is in need of it, as a father and mother must do 
with their children and servants and a brother, neighbor, citizen, 
or peasant with another. For a Christian can instruct and ad¬ 
monish another who is yet ignorant or weak in the Ten Command¬ 
ments, the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, etc.; and whoever hears this 
is in duty bound to receive it from him as God’s Word and to 
confess it publicly.” (Cf. X, 1590.) 

However, on the other hand, Luther also writes (St. L., 
V, 1037) : “Though we all are priests, yet we all neither can nor 
should for this reason preach, teach, or rule. But from the whole 
throng we must select and choose some to whom we entrust this 
office; and whoever conducts it is not a priest on account of his 
office (which they all are), but a servant of all others. And if he 
can no longer preach or serve, or if he should no longer desire this, 
he again steps among the common throng, entrusts his office to 
another, and is nothing else than an ordinary Christian. Thus you 
must distinguish between the ministry, or the office of service, and 
the common priesthood of all baptized Christians. For this office 
is nothing else than a public service, which is entrusted to one by 
&e whole congregation, who are all priests at the same time.” 
(Cf. X, 1589.) 

3. THE PUBLIC MINISTRY IS A DIVINE APPOINTMENT 

OR ORDINANCE. 

The public ministry is a divine appointment or ordinance. 
This follows, as we have shown — 

a) From the practise of the holy apostles, Acts 14, 23, and 
from their command to their successors to ordain elders, or bishops, 
Titus 1, 5, so that ministers or pastors {ngeoftvzeQot, Iniaxonoi ) 
were regularly appointed at all places where local churches had 
been established, Acts 20,17.18; Titus 1, 5; 

b) From the description of the personal qualifications of the 
public ministers, 1 Pet. 5, 3; 1 Tim. 3, 2—7; 



THE DOOTBINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


567 


c) From the description of their functions and duties, Titus 
1, 9—11; 1 Tim. 3, 5; Acts 20, 28. 21; 1 Pet. 5, Iff.; Heb. 
13, 17; etc.; 

d) From the distinction which Scripture makes between the 
elders, or bishops, and all other believers, 1 Cor. 12, 28. 29; 

e) From the honor and dignity which are ascribed to all who 
officially teach the Word, Heb. 13, 7; 1 Cor. 4,1. 

We repeat this for the sake of emphasis, since this doctrine, 
so clearly taught in Scripture and so emphatically set forth by our 
Lutheran dogmaticians, has been denied also within the external 
Lutheran Church. 

The claim has been made by some, e. g., Hoefling, that the 
ministry of the Word in its concrete form (Pfarramt) is of human 
origin or a mere “historical development They contend that the 
appointment of elders (jiqeo^vteqoi) in the Church, Acts 14, 23; 
Titus 1, 5ff., had only a temporary or local significance, since the 
peculiar conditions prevailing in those early times made bishops, or 
presbyters, necessary. 

To this argument we reply that such a limitation of the apos¬ 
tolic appointment of ministers is nowhere suggested in the text. 
On the contrary, elders, or bishops, were put in charge of the various 
churches because it is God’s appointment that there should be 
elders, or bishops (ministers, pastors), who “take heed unto the 
flock and feed the Church of God,” Acts 20, 28—31; “rule well 
and labor in the Word and doctrine,” 1 Tim. 5,17; “labor among 
the brethren and are over the believers in the Lord and admonish 
them,” 1 Thess. 5,12.13; “watch over their souls as they that must 
give account,” Heb. 13,17; etc. 

Hence it is not optional with believers to organize local 
churches and to establish the office of the public ministry in their 
midst, but this must be done because of Christ’s institution and 
ordinance. So also Dr. Walther taught: “The ministry, or pas¬ 
toral office (Pfarramt), is no human institution, but an office which 
has been instituted by God Himself(Kirche und Amt, 193. 211.) 
The Apology is in full agreement with Scripture when it writes: 
"Ministerium Verbi habet mandatum Dei.” 

It is true, Hoefling and his associates admitted that the public 
ministry is God’s institution and ordinance in the sense that every¬ 
thing that is “reasonable,” “proper,” and “morally necessary” may 
be called a divine ordinance, 1 Cor. 14,40. But he denied that the 



568 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


public ministry is divinely commanded or appointed (cp. Qrund- 
saetze ev. luth. Kirchenverfassung, Erlangen, 3d ed., 1853) since it 
resulted merely from an “inner necessity” (“mit innerer Not - 
wendigkeit”) . For this reason he also denied the conclusions which 
our Lutheran dogmaticians have rightly drawn from such passages 
as Acts 14, 23; Titus 1, 5, etc. 

However, Hoefling’s argument was not based upon any clear 
Scripture-passage, but upon the unwarranted inference that, if the 
public ministry is regarded as divinely commanded, then a legal¬ 
istic or ceremonial element is transferred from the Old to the New 
Testament, which, however, is not a covenant of commands or laws, 
but of Christian freedom, Gal. 5, 1—7, and as such incapable of 
legalistic elements. 

But this argument defeats itself by proving too much; for, 
consistently applied, it would abrogate all divine institutions and 
ordinances of the New Testament, so that Christians could not be 
commanded to baptize, to celebrate the Lord’s Supper, to preach 
the Gospel, to follow after holiness, and the like. In that case the 
New Testament Church ultimately would have to adopt Antinomi- 
anism as its only alternative. 

The error of Hoefling and his followers originated in their 
opposition to Romanizing Lutherans (Muenchmeyer, Loehe, Klie- 
foth, Yilmar, etc.), who claimed that the public ministry is 
a divine institution in the sense that it has been directly transmitted 
from the apostles to their successors as a ministerial estate (geist- 
licher Stand) through the rite of ordination. 

Hoefling’s opponents thus presented as Lutheran doctrine 
a caricature of the Lutheran doctrine of the divine institution of 
the public ministry. In addition, they spoke as though the means 
of grace were truly efficacious only if they are applied by persons 
who through the rite of ordination have received their office directly 
from the holy apostles (cp. Bomanism; Episcopalianism: the 
apostolic succession). 

Hoefling correctly rejected this Romanizing doctrine, but erred 
on the other hand by denying the mandatum Dei of the public 
ministry. In order to deny Loehe’s immediate divine establishment 
of the public ministry, he regarded it as necessary to deny also its 
mediate divine establishment, or the fact that it is God’s institution 
and ordinance that Christian believers should confer upon called 
and ordained ministers the public administration of the Office of 
the Keys. 

In the controversy, men like Stroebel ( Zeitschr . /. luth. Th. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


509 


und K., 1852, p. 699) correctly pointed out that it is indeed the 
divine right [under certain conditions even the unavoidable duty] 
of every baptized Christian as a spiritual priest to preach the Word 
of God to his neighbor, to administer the Sacraments, to forgive 
his sins, to lay on hands, etc., but that he should exercise this right 
only in case of need on account of God’s established order, with 
which He is well pleased; otherwise he should make use of the 
office of pastors who are rightly called by Christ through the con¬ 
gregation. Christian congregations should consider that they must 
not discard the spiritual office (the pastoral office) instituted by 
Christ nor allow it to be usurped by a foolish mob or by ecclesias¬ 
tical or worldly tyrants, but that they should always confer it on 
capable, faithful, and pious men until the Lord’s second coming.... 
For it is an illogical conclusion to say: "All who have not received 
the spiritual office [the pastoral office] directly from the Lord, but 
through the congregation have received it from men and are there¬ 
fore servants of men.” (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 508—512; 
also Lehre und Wehre, 1870, p. 161ff. 174; 1855, p. Iff.) 

4. IS THE PUBLIC MINISTRY NECESSARY? 

Although the public ministry (the pastoral office), which is 
mediately conferred upon pastors through the congregation, is 
a divine institution, it is not absolutely necessary; for all be¬ 
lievers, as spiritual priests, are bound by divine command to preach 
the Gospel, 1 Pet. 2, 9, and to teach and admonish one another in 
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Col. 3,16. Already Luther 
called attention to the fact that “the world may become so utterly 
epicurean that upon the whole earth there will be no public min¬ 
istry at all, but that the Gospel will be preserved alone in the 
[Christian] homes through [Christian] fathers” (St. L., VI, 938). 
Also through the study of the Bible by individual believers Christ’s 
Church may be preserved and spread on earth. 

Hence, as Dr. Walther rightly affirms (Kirche und Amt, 
p. 195), the pastoral office (P fair amt) must not be regarded as 
a sort of means of grace, which is absolutely necessary for the 
salvation of men, so that no one can come to faith and receive 
remission of sins without the service of an ordained pastor. This 
absolute necessity applies only to the use of the Word of God, 
and in particular to that of the Gospel of Christ, without which no 
one can ordinarily be saved. 

The enthusiasts, who deny the necessity of preaching the 



570 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


Gospel, claiming that it is the “inner Word” (Verburn internum) 
which saves, reject the clear teaching of Scripture concerning the 
means of grace and base their doctrine on their speculations. 
Luther: “We must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace 
to no one except through or with the preceding outward Word in 
order that we may [thus] be protected against the enthusiasts, 
i. e., spirits who boast that they have the Spirit without and before 
the Word.” ( Smalcald Art., Part III, Art. VIII, 3. Triglot, 
p. 495.) 

Nevertheless, while the public ministry is not absolutely neces¬ 
sary, it should not be despised. This is done a) when Christians 
refuse to come to church, claiming that they read the Bible at 
home, Luke 10, 16; Heb. 10, 23—25 (cp. Luther, St. L., Ill, 
1736); or b) when called and ordained ministers neglect their holy 
office under the plea that their flock does not require feeding, since, 
as spiritual priests, they can take care of themselves (cp. Ezek. 
3,17 ff.; 2 Tim. 4, 2ff.; 1 Tim. 4,13 ff.; Phil. 2, 21; also Luther, 
St. L., X, 5); or c) when churches refuse to maintain schools in 
which Christian ministers or teachers are trained for the holy office 
(St. L., X, 417. 458ff.). Contempt for the public ministry is com¬ 
monly motivated by contempt for Christ and His blessed Gospel, 
Matt. 10, 22; 24, 9; John 17,14. 

5. THE CALL INTO THE MINISTRY. 

(De Vocatione Ministerial!.) 

Concerning the necessity of the ministerial call the Augsburg 
Confession declares (Art. XIY) : “No one should publicly teach 
in the Church or administer the Sacraments unless he be regularly 
called.” What is meant by the ministerial call, Hollaz explains 
thus: “By the divine call is here understood the appointment of 
a certain and suitable person to the ministry of the Church, with 
the right to teach in public, to administer the Sacraments, and to 
exercise ecclesiastical discipline, made by God either alone or by the 
intervening aid of men.” ( Doctr . Theol., p. 607.) 

Our dogmaticians rightly distinguish between the immediate 
and the mediate call (vocatio immediata, vocatio mediata). This 
distinction, which also Luther makes (St. L., XI, 1910ff.), is Scrip¬ 
tural; for Holy Scripture shows that even the prophets and the 
apostles (including St. Paul) never preached without a call from 
God (Ex. 3,10; Is. 6, 8. 9; 40, 6—9; Jer. 1, 2—10; Mark 16,15; 
Matt. 28, 19. 20; John 20, 21—23; Acts 22, 21; Gal. 1, 1; Eph. 
1,1; Col. 1,1; etc.). 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


571 


The immediate call is that divine call which is made “without 
any intervening judicial (arbitraria) aid of other men” (Baier). 
As Hollaz correctly says, “an immediate call is not to be expected 
in the Church to-day.” 

The mediate call is no less divine than is the immediate. The 
difference between the two, as Gerhard explains, is merely this, that 
the mediate call is effected “through ordinary means” (per vocar 
tionem ecclesiae), divinely appointed for this purpose, while the 
immediate call comes from God directly. 

The divinity of the mediate call Gerhard establishes from the 
following facts: a) It is referred to God as its Author, 1 Cor. 
12,28; Eph. 4,11. b) It is based upon apostolic authority, Acts 
14,23; 20,28; 1 Tim. 4,14; 3,1.2; 5,21; 2Tim.l,6; 2,2; 
Col. 4,17. c) It is confirmed by God’s gracious promises, 1 Tim. 
4,16; 2 Cor. 3,6; Eph. 4,11.12. 

The divinity of the mediate call is amply proved by the fact 
that Holy Scripture says of the elders, or bishops, who were called 
mediately: “The Holy Ghost hath made you overseers,” Acts 20, 28. 

That also the mediate call is truly divine is of the greatest 
importance both to the ministers themselves and to those whom 
they serve, 1 Cor. 4,1; Luke 10,16; 1 Pet. 5, 2. 3; Jer. 23, 21; 
Heb. 5, 4; Jas. 3,1. 

Since the mediate call is extended through men (the Church), 
we must consider also the question who the men are by whom God 
duly calls His ministers. The Romanists claim that only the Pope 
has authority to create bishops and their assistants. The Epis¬ 
copalians teach that ordination by the bishop confers the highest 
orders. Romanizing Lutherans hold that Christian ministers owe 
their pastoral authority to “the estate of the ministry” (der geist- 
liche Stand), which is self-propagating. In other cases, princes or 
ruling bodies in the Church have claimed the right to call and 
ordain ministers. 

However, Holy Scripture ascribes this power to call to all 
true believers, since to them Christ has entrusted the Office of the 
Keys, Matt. 18,17; 1 Cor. 5, 4.13; 3, 21. Christ’s Great Commis¬ 
sion, Matt. 28,19. 20, was meant not only for the apostles, but for 
all Christians; for He states expressly: “I am with you alway, 
even unto the end of the world.” By virtue of their spiritual 
priesthood all believers “unto the end of the world” possess the 
inherent right to preach the Gospel and to administer the Sacra¬ 
ments. Since, then, all Christian believers are entrusted with the 
means of grace, it is their privilege to call pastors, or ministers, 



572 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


who in their name publicly apply the means of grace. Cp. Luther: 
“That some are chosen from the multitude is done for the reason 
that they, as representatives of the congregation, should administer 
and execute the office [ministerial office], which they all have." 
(St. L., IX, 1174.) 

But while the communion of all believers constitutes the 
Church Universal, it is not to the ecclesia universalis as such that 
Christ has given the power to call and ordain ministers, but rather 
to the local churches (ecclesiae particular es), as is clear from Matt. 
18,17—20; 1 Cor. 5,13; etc. The Smalcald Articles rightly say 
(Of the Power and Primacy of the Pope, § 67—69): “Wherever 
there is a true church, the right to elect and ordain ministers neces¬ 
sarily exists.” (Cp. also Luther, St. L., XVII, 1074ff.) 

Individual persons or representative bodies may duly call 
ministers for others, but only if they, either directly or by consent, 
tacito consensu, have received authority to do so from those who 
originally possess the right to call, principaliter et immediate, that 
is, from local churches. 

Against the exclusive right of the local congregations to call 
their ministers various objections have been raised, of which we 
may note the following: — 

a. Not the local churches, hut the apostles (Paul, Barnabas, 
Titus) "ordained elders in every church," Acts lit, 28; Titus 1,5. 
To this objection Luther replies (St. L., XIX, 347): “Although 
Paul commanded Titus to ‘ordain elders in every city,’ Titus 1, 6, 
it does not follow that Titus did this in an arbitrary manner; but 
he, after the example of the apostles, appointed them after their 
election by the people; otherwise the command of Paul would be 
in conflict with the general custom of the apostles.” 

There are indeed weighty reasons why Luther’s explanation 
should be believed and accepted. In the first place, the text (Acts 
14, 23) itself suggests the calling of elders by a popular vote 
(xeiQozovrjoavTeg, not constituebant (Vulgate), but rather “stimm- 
waehlen" (Meyer), that is to say, having chosen them by the raising 
of hands. In the second place, it was the general custom of the 
apostles, Acts 6, 2— 6, to have the “whole multitude” (nav to 
7ilrj&og) elect by popular vote the ministers of the churches 
(Stephen, Philip, etc.. Acts 6, 5). For this reason we rightly infer 
that the verb zeiqotoveo) (to stretch forth the hand, to elect by the 
raising of hands, " durch Aufheben der Hand abstimmen") has this 
special meaning both in Acts 14, 23 and 2 Cor. 8,19 (“the brother 
chosen of the churches”: x El Q°*ovr]&elc vno xcbv Ixxlrjoidtv). The

573 


apostles, then, ordained elders not arbitrarily, by their mere apos¬ 
tolic authority (Loehe), but with direct consent and by active 
cooperation of the local churches. 

b. Not the local churches, but Peter received the Office of the 
Keys, Matt. 16,18.19. This objection does not hold, since Peter, 
on this occasion, did not come into consideration as an apostle or 
as a leader of the apostles (primus inter pares), but merely as 
a believing follower of Christ, who professed the divine truth 
(cp. Matt. 16,17). The rock (ntiga) upon which Christ built His 
Church is not Peter's person (Ilhgog), but the confession which 
Peter as a believer in Christ here made. 

So Luther writes: “All Christians are Peters for the sake of 
the confession which Peter here makes, which [confession] is the 
rock on which Peter and all Peters are built.” (Marginal note to 
Matt. 16,18). The “keys of the kingdom of heaven” are the means 
of grace, in particular the Gospel, which Christ has entrusted to 
all believers, 1 Pet. 2, 9. And Chemnitz says ( Examen, 1667, 
p. 223): “Luther taught from the Word of God that Christ gave 
and commended the keys, that is, the ministry of the Word and 
the Sacraments, to the whole Church” Inasmuch as all believers 
are entrusted with the means of grace, they possess the keys of 
the kingdom of heaven. 

c. The Lutheran Confessions teach that the public ministry is 
directly derived from the apostolic office. To this we reply that, 
rightly understood, this statement is correct; for although Chris¬ 
tian ministers are not apostles in the sense of the chosen Twelve 
(and St. Paul), who by divine inspiration were infallible teachers 
of the Word of God both as preachers and as writers of the New 
Testament canon, yet their office, so far as its content and efficacy 
are concerned, is precisely the same as was that of the apostles. 
In other words, Christian ministers to-day preach the same Word 
of God and administer the same Sacraments as did the apostles; 
and these means of grace, used by them, are just as efficacious 
to-day as when they were employed by the Twelve. 

This is not a “dogmatic construction,” but the clear teaching 
of Scripture; for when Christ commanded His disciples to preach 
the Gospel and to administer the Sacraments, Matt. 28,20; Mark 
16, 15. 16, He expressly specified that the ministry of the Word 
should continue “even unto the end of the world.” Rightly under¬ 
stood, that is, excluding all Romanistic and Episcopalian errors on 
this point (apostolic succession) as well as the false notions of 



574 


THE DOCTRINE OP THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


Romanizing Lutherans (Loehe, Vilmar, Muenchmeyer, etc.), we 
may therefore say that the public ministry to-day is a continuation 
of the ministry of the apostles. 

To this we may add that the apostles themselves regarded their 
non-apostolic fellow-ministers, that is, the elders and bishops who 
with them served the various churches, as equal in rank and office, 
1 Cor. 4, Iff.; 1 Pet. 6, Iff. (lit.): “The elders ( ngeofivtegovs ) 
among you I exhort as the fellow-elder (owngEofimegoe).” 

Yet, while this is true, it is true also that our Confessions, 
in accord with Scripture, Matt. 18, 17—20; 1 Cor. 5, 13; Rom. 
16,17; 1 Pet. 2, 9, expressly teach that the Office of the Keys be¬ 
longs to the whole Church and that Christian ministers therefore 
hold their office by virtue of their call from their churches. The 
Smalcald Articles say (Of the Power and Primacy of the Pope, 
67—69) : “Wherever the Church is, there is the authority [com¬ 
mand] to administer the Gospel. Therefore it is necessary for the 
Church to retain the authority to call, elect, and ordain ministers. 
And this authority is a gift that in reality is given to the Church, 
which no human power can wrest from the Church. . . . Hence, 
wherever there is a true church, the right to elect and ordain min¬ 
isters necessarily exists. . . . Here belong the statements of Christ 
which testify that the keys have been given to the Church, and not 
merely to certain persons. Matt. 18, 20. Lastly, also the statement 
of Peter confirms this, 1 Pet. 2, 9. These words pertain to the 
Church, which certainly has the right to elect and ordain ministers 
since it alone has the priesthood.” While, then, all Christian 
ministers who are duly called are “fellow-elders” (owngEaflvTEgoi) 
of the blessed apostles, 2 John 1; 3 John 1; 1 Cor. 3, 5—9, they 
are elders and bishops (ministers, pastors) not through any “apos¬ 
tolic succession” nor through any “self-propagation of the clerical 
estate,” but solely by virtue of the call which they have received 
from their churches. In other words, it is alone the divine call 
extended to them mediately through the local congregation that 
makes them “fellow-elders” of the apostles. 

6. OF ORDINATION. 

The ordination of called ministers is not a divine institution, 
or ordinance, but a church rite; for while it is mentioned, Acts 
14, 23, it is not commanded in Scripture. We therefore rightly 
classify ordination among the adiaphora and affirm that not the 
ordination, but the call makes a person a minister. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


575 


Luther writes (St. L., XVII, 114): “The laying on of hands 
[ordination] blesses, confirms, and attests this [the call to the 
office], just as a notary and witnesses attest a worldly matter and 
as a pastor, when he blesses a bridegroom and bride, confirms or 
attests their marriage, that is, that they before took each other 
and publicly announced it.” 

Similarly also the Smalcald Articles declare that ordination 
is only the public ratification of the call. They say (Of the Power 
and Primacy of the Pope, 70) : “Formerly the people elected 
pastors and bishops. Then came a bishop, either of that church 
or a neighboring one, who confirmed the one elected by the laying 
on of hands; and ordination was nothing else than such a rati¬ 
fication.” 

For this reason the confessional Lutheran Church does not 
practise the so-called absolute ordination , that is, the ordination 
of a person who as yet has received no call, since this might create 
the wrong impression as though by the ordination the ordained 
person were received into a “spiritual estate” (ein geistlicher Stand) 
and made a consecrated priest, who is eligible for a call by a con¬ 
gregation just because of special virtues conferred by the ordi¬ 
nation. (Cp. Walther, Pastorale, p. 65.) 

It goes without saying that also the right of ordination is 
originally vested in the local churches, as the Smalcald Articles 
declare: “Wherever there is a true church, the right to elect and 
ordain ministers necessarily exists.” 

According to Boman Catholic doctrine only those are Chris¬ 
tian ministers (priests) who have been ordained by bishops created 
by the Pope, while pastors called and ordained by Christian congre¬ 
gations are thieves and murderers (Council of Trent, Sess. XXIII, 
Can. 4). From the viewpoint of the Papacy this antichristian doc¬ 
trine is quite intelligible; for according to papistic teaching the 
“sacrament” of ordination confers ex opere operato upon the or¬ 
dained the Holy Spirit and impresses upon him an “indelible char¬ 
acter” (character indelebilis), which makes him a priest for all 
times, even though by gross sins he should render himself un¬ 
worthy of the sacred office. 

But this is not all. Through the ordination the priest, ac¬ 
cording to Roman Catholic doctrine, receives also the supernatural 
power to transubstantiate the bread and wine in the Holy Supper 
into Christ’s body and blood and to offer these up as a sacrifice for 
the sins of the living and the dead (Council of Trent, De Sacram. 
Ord., Cans. 1—8). This is a power so great that not even the holy 



576 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


angels or the greatest saints are said to possess it. Indeed, this 
power is superior even to that of the human nature of Christ, 
which, as they claim, must obey the command of the priest when¬ 
ever he bids it appear on earth to be sacrificed for the sins of the 
living and the dead. The papistic doctrine of ordination and the 
Mass therefore involves an unspeakable blasphemy of Christ and 
His holy Word. 

While the Episcopalians do not acknowledge the Pope as the 
vicar of Christ on earth, they nevertheless teach that ordination 
is the only means by which the apostolic succession, and with it 
the true ministry, can be transmitted. 

Finally also the Romanizing Lutherans, who regard the min¬ 
istry as a “special spiritual estate” (ein beeonderer geistlicher 
Stand), which is self-propagating, change the church rite of ordi¬ 
nation into a divine institution, or ordinance. These Bomanizing 
Lutherans emphatically deny that the Christian minister receives 
his office through the call of the congregation, though this doctrine 
is clearly taught in Scripture. 

7. THE CHRISTIAN MINISTRY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE 
A SPIRITUAL ESTATE. 

Attention may be directed to the fact that also Luther, in 
accommodation to the usus loquendi, at times speaks of ministers, 
that is, of those “who serve in ecclesiastical offices” (St. L., 
X, 423 ff.), as “priests,” “spirituals” (Geistliche), a “spiritual 
estate” (geistlicher Stand), etc. He declares, however, that the use 
of these terms is not only without foundation in Scripture, but also 
misleading, since according to Holy Scripture all believers are 
“anointed,” 1 John 2, 27, “spiritual,” Gal. 6,1, a “spiritual house” 
and a “spiritual priesthood,” 1 Pet. 2, 5. 9. "Alle Christen sind 
ivahrhaft geistlichen Stands, und ist unter ihnen kein Unterschied 
denn des Amts halber aJlein (Cf. Eutterus Redivivus, p. 270.) 

Luther furthermore declares that the Holy Spirit in the New 
Testament carefully avoids the application of the name priest 
(sacerdos) to the apostles or their colaborers, while He distinctly 
applies that term to all baptized Christians. He says (St. L., 
XIX, 1260) : “We are not born [again] in Baptism as apostles, 
teachers, preachers, pastors, but as priests. Then the Church takes 
one of these regenerate priests and calls and elects him to such 
functions as all believers should execute because of their [priestly] 
office.” Luther thus rejects the erroneous opinion that ministers, 
or pastors, constitute a “spiritual estate.” 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 577 

Luther’s position is in strict conformity with the teaching of 
Holy Scripture; for Scripture describes the elders and bishops not 
as "spiritual” in preference to others, but as ministers (servants) 
of the believers (ministrantes inter Christianos), 2 Cor. 4, 5. It is 
true, all pastors are also servants of Christ and of God, 1 Cor. 4,1; 
Titus 1,7; 2 Tim. 2,24; Luke 12,42; but they are such only as 
ministers of the Church or because the Church has called them to 
be "ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.” 

Of this Luther writes (St. L., X, 1590): "Paul calls himself 
servnm, that is, a servant, and more than once he says: Servio in 
evangelio, I serve in the Gospel. This he does not in order that 
he may establish an estate or order, a right or a certain dignity, 
as people to-day would do, but that he might alone praise the office 
and work and preserve the right and dignity of the priesthood in 
the congregation.” 

Similarly Dr. Walther says (Kirche und Amt, p. 221): “The 
public ministry is not a special estate, which exists in contra¬ 
distinction to the common state of Christians or is holier than it, 
but it is a ministry of service.” 

For this reason the churches have also the right and the duty 
to watch over the ministry of their pastors and teachers, Col. 4,17, 
and to dismiss them in case they refuse to preach the Word of 
God in its truth and purity and to adorn it with a holy life, Col. 
4, 17; John 10, 5; Matt. 7, 15; Rom. 16, 17. 18. (Cp. Luther, 
St. L., X, 1591.) 

Ministers, of course, hold their office only so long as they ad¬ 
minister the functions of the public ministry which they have 
received through the call. 

When describing the manner in which called ministers receive 
their divine office from the congregation, our dogmaticians have 
used the verb confer (uebertragen, demandare, deferre, comittere). 
They said: “Through the call the Christian congregation confers 
the public ministry upon qualified persons.” 

This term should not be condemned as objectionable; for it 
expresses the Scriptural truth that the congregation is the "foun¬ 
tain of all church power” (Hase: “der Quell aller Eirchengewalt”) 
by virtue of the Office of the Keys which Christ has given to His 
Church, and that pastors exercise the public ministry only in the 
name and by the authority of the congregation. Those who object 
to the term have reason to examine themselves whether they fully

CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



678 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


agree with the Scriptural doctrine of the Office of the Keys. 
(Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 522ff.) 

With respect to the power which Christian pastors possess by 
virtue of their call our dogmaticians rightly say that all power 
which they have as ministers is conferred upon, or delegated to, 
them by the congregation, so that their jurisdiction is limited by 
the call. 

The power of the ministry (potestas ministerialis) embraces 
a) the power of preaching the Gospel and administering the Sacra¬ 
ments (potestas ordinis) and b) that of remitting and retaining 
sins (potestas clavium, potestas iurisdictionis ). 

The power of excommunication, commonly called the ban, 
the pastor must never administer without the congregation, Matt. 
18,17.18; 1 Cor. 6,13. It is properly the function of the pastor 
rightly to guide the congregation in judging each case and, if the 
sinner under discipline is found to be impenitent, to publish and 
declare publicly as a servant of the church what the congregation 
has decided to do, 1 Cor. 5,1—7.13. 

Again, if the sinner repents, it is the duty of the pastor to 
urge the congregation to forgive him, 2 Cor. 2, 6—11, and then to 
publish, or declare publicly, the absolution of the congregation. 
A ban which a minister executes contrary to God’s Word and with¬ 
out the congregation Luther calls a “lying ban” (Luegenbann). 
(Cp. St.L., XIX, 950ff.) 

8. THE POWER OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 

Since the pastoral office is the ministry of the divine Word 
(ministerium Verbi et sacramentorum, Onadenmittelamt, potestas 
clavium), all believers are in duty bound to obey their pastors just 
as they obey God Himself, Heb. 13, 17; Luke 10, 16. As long 
therefore as pastors are true ministers of the Word, their authority 
(potestas) is as great as that of the divine Word. However, as soon 
as they go beyond God’s Word and teach commandments of men, 
they have no authority at all, and their hearers must refuse them 
obedience for conscience’ sake, Matt. 23, 8; Rom. 16,17. 

Adiaphora (res mediae), that is, matters which are neither 
commanded nor forbidden by God’s Word, should not be adjudged 
by the minister, but by the entire congregation by common consent 
(per mutuum consensum). 

Against the claim of the papists that laymen must obey their 
priests in all things, the Apology correctly declares (Art. XXVIII, 
19. 20): “He that heareth you heareth Me, Luke 10,16, cannot be 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


579 


understood of traditions. For Christ requires that they teach in 
such a way that (by their mouth) He Himself be heard, because 
He says: ‘He heareth Me.’ Therefore He wishes His own voice. 
His own Word, to be heard, not human traditions. Thus a saying 
which is most especially in our favor and contains the most impor¬ 
tant consolation and doctrine these stupid men pervert to the most 
trifling matters, the distinction of food, vestments, and the like. 
They quote Heb. 13,17: ‘Obey them that have the rule over you/ 
This passage requires obedience to the Gospel. For it does not 
establish a dominion for the bishops apart from the Gospel. 
Neither should the bishops frame traditions contrary to the Gospel 
or interpret their traditions contrary to the Gospel. And when 
they do this, obedience is prohibited, according to Gal. 1, 9: Tf any 
man preach any other gospel, let him be accursed/ ” 

The minister therefore has no power or jurisdiction whatever 
(iure divino) outside his call and office. His authority is limited 
to the potestas clavium (the Office of the Keys, Schluesselgewalt). 

9. THE RELATION OF CHRISTIAN MINISTERS 
TO ONE ANOTHER. 

On account of the various ranks and orders which the Papacy 
has created contrary to God’s Word (the Roman Catholic hier¬ 
archy), it is necessary to emphasize the Scripture truth that all 
Christian ministers are equal in rank and dignity, Matt. 23, 8; 
1 Pet. 6,1. As Christian pastors have no power over their congre¬ 
gations outside that which God has given them as ministers of the 
Word, so by divine right (iure divino) they have no power at all 
over their fellow-ministers. Whatever ranks there are in the 
Church are only of human right (iure humano). 

Luther writes on this point: “Neither is the Pope higher 
than the bishops nor the bishop higher than all presbyters, accord¬ 
ing to divine right.” This is true Scriptural doctrine. 

As the Romanists, so also the Episcopalians and othei Roman¬ 
izing Protestant bodies pervert the Scriptural doctrine regarding 
the equality of Christian ministers. 

With respect to the terms presbyters (jigeo^megoi) and bishops 
(imoxonot) Scripture makes no distinction whatever, but denomi¬ 
nates the same persons by both names, Acts 20,17. 28; Titus 1, 5. 7. 

The prohibition of St. Paul to Christians not to be servants of 
men, 1 Cor. 7, 23, applies also to all attempts at establishing human 
authority (Menschenknechtschaft) in the Church through the 
inauguration of hierarchism. (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 524ff.) 



580 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


10. THE PUBLIC MINISTRY IS THE SUPREME OFFICE 

IN THE CHURCH. 

That the public ministry (Pfarramt) is the supreme office in 
the Church is a thought to which Luther in his writings reverts 
time and again. But he also shows why the office of the Christian 
pastor must be regarded as the highest office; it is supreme because 
of the Word of Ood which it teaches and applies. Luther says 
(St. L., X, 1592): “If the ministry of the Word is committed to 
some one, then also all the other offices which are administered in 
the Church through the Word are given him, namely, the power to 
baptize, to bless [to administer Holy Communion], to bind and to 
loose, to pray, to judge and decide. Indeed, the office of preaching 
the Gospel is the highest of all; for it is the true apostolic office, 
which lays the foundation for all others, on which all others must 
build, as, for example, the office of teachers, prophets, and rulers 
and those of persons who have the gift of healing.” (Cp. also 
X, 1547.) 

Of the bishops, who according to 1 Tim. 3, 5 must take care of 
the Church of God, Luther writes (St. L., XII, 338): “These, 
then, are those who must take care of all other offices that the 
teachers may attend to their office and not be negligent, that the 
deacons may rightly divide the gifts and not be indolent.” 

Again (X, 1548): “To whom the ministry of the Word is com¬ 
mitted, to him is entrusted the highest office in Christendom; hence 
he may also baptize, administer the Mass [Holy Communion], 
and attend to all pastoral duties. But if he does not wish to do 
this, he may adhere alone to preaching and leave the other secondary 
offices (Unteraemter) to others, as Christ and Paul and all apostles 
did. Acts 6.” 

As Luther, so also the confessional Lutheran Church teaches 
that the public ministry (the pastoral office) is the supreme office 
in the Church, since it deals with the Word, which is Christ’s 
supreme gift to the Church. (Cp. Dr. Walther on the proposition: 
“The Ministry of the Word the Highest Office in the Church, from 
which All Other Offices of the Church Flow.” Kirche und Amt, 
p. 34211.) 

11. OF ANTICHRIST. 

Holy Scripture employs the term antichrist in a wider and in 
a narrower sense. Used in a wider sense, the term denotes all 
teachers who supplant the Word of God with doctrines of men, 
1 John 2, 18. All false teachers must be regarded as antichrists 



THE DOCTRINE OP THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


581 


(ivzixQiozoi , adversaries of Christ), since our Lord insists that in 
the Church no other doctrine should be taught than that of Holy 
Scripture, Matt. 28, 20; John 8, 31. 32; 17, 20; 5, 39; Rom. 
16,17; 1 Pet. 4,11; 1 Tim. 6, 3ff.; 2 Tim. 3,15—17; 2 John 10; 
Rev. 22,18.19. All who disregard this divine command are insur¬ 
gents and adversaries of God, Luke 11, 23. 

In its narrower sense the term dvzixgiorog, however, denotes 
the great Antichrist, whose coming is foretold in 2 Thess. 2, 3—12. 
In 1 John 2, 18 this Antichrist xaz’ l£oxrjv is carefully distin¬ 
guished from the “many antichrists,” and his appearance is repre¬ 
sented as a sign of the last times. In him antichristianism culmi¬ 
nates, 2 Thess. 2, 7f. 

Since Holy Scripture pictures the Antichrist as the Wicked, 
of whom all believers must beware and whom therefore they can 
know, 2 Thess. 2, 8, we must carefully consider the marks by which 
divine prophecy characterizes him. These unmistakable marks, 
according to 2 Thess. 2, 3—12, are the following: — 

a. The “falling away” (t) dnoozaoin). That this “falling away” 
must not be understood in a political sense (Communism and 
anarchy; the appearance of despotic sovereigns), as some erro¬ 
neously opined, but in a spiritual or religious meaning, 2 Thess. 2, 
10—12 clearly shows. The apostasy is caused by a “strong delu¬ 
sion,” the result of which is that men believe lies and are damned 
through their misbelief. It is therefore “a falling away” from 
Christ and His Word, 2 Thess. 2, 4. 

b. The “sitting in the temple ” 2 Thess. 2, 4. The great apos¬ 
tasy from Christ and the Gospel occurs not outside, but within 
the Church; for “the temple of God” is the Church, 1 Cor. 3,16ff.; 
1 Tim. 3,15; 2 Tim. 2, 20. The great apostasy which Antichrist 
causes is therefore not the spread of paganism or of antichristian 
cults, but a falling away within the external Church. For this 
reason it is called also “the mystery of iniquity” ivozrjgiov zrje 
dvojuiag), v. 7, that is, a lawlessness which conceals itself by pious 
words and forms. Nor is this lawlessness only temporary, but it 
is permanent; for the Antichrist will continue to sit in the temple 
of God until the Lord’s second return, v. 8. 

c. The opposing and exalting above all that is called God. The 
Antichrist, who sits in the temple of God, will be in constant 
opposition to God and His Word, claiming for himself supreme 
authority in religion (“showing himself that he is God,” v. 4). 
Under the reign of Antichrist the Church will obey neither Christ 



582 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


nor His Gospel, but do only what Antichrist by his alleged divine 
authority demands. All who are under his rule are bound to 
submit to him, not to God. 

d. The working of Satan in Antichrist. While Antichrist is 
not Satan himself, his “coming is after the working of Satan” 
(xar’ ivigyeiav r ov nazavd, v. 9); that is, he appears by the de¬ 
ceitful, crafty, and wicked working of Satan and sustains himself 
in the Church by Satan’s power; for with the help of Satan he 
is able to perform “all power and signs and lying wonders,” v. 9. 
The adjective modifier lying in our translation (Greek: yevdovg) 
belongs to all three nouns: power, signs, wonders. As Antichrist 
teaches doctrines that are lies, so he also performs works that are 
lies. His rule therefore rests upon his ability, wrought by Satan, 
to deceive men by all manner of lies. 

e. The revealing and consuming of Antichrist with the Spirit 
of the Lortfs mouth, v. 8. Antichrist will remain unknown to many 
(“mystery of iniquity,” v. 7); yet in due time he will be revealed 
and consumed by the spirit of the Lord’s mouth, which is God’s 
Word, Is. 11, 4; 49,2; Rev. 1,16. Antichrist will therefore be re¬ 
vealed and consumed through the preaching of God’s Word. This, 
however, does not mean the end of his wicked reign; for the Lord 
Himself shall “destroy” him {xmagyryaei, annul him, put him out 
of the way) “with the brightness of His coming,” v. 8; that is to 
say, the reign of Antichrist will continue till Judgment Day. 

f. Antichrist’s coming and reign are a manifestation of Godfs 
wrath upon all those who “received not the love of the truth that 
they might be saved,” v. 10. His appearance therefore leads to the 
damnation of many, v. 12, and thus foreshadows God’s condemning 
wrath on Judgment Day, v. 3. 

All these marks of Antichrist we witness not in individual 
deceivers (Arius, Mohammed) nor in individual tyrants (Nero, 
Napoleon), but in the Papacy. Here, within the external Church 
of Christ, is the great apostasy (dnooraoia), namely, the rejection 
of Scripture as the only source and norm of faith and of the cen¬ 
tral doctrine of the Christian religion, the sola fide, “which alone 
begets, nourishes, builds, preserves, and defends the Church and 
without which the Church of God cannot exist even for an hour” 
(Luther; St. L., XIV, 168). 

In the Church of Antichrist the doctrine of justification by 
grace through faith is anathematized, and its Christian defenders 
are damned as heretics and antichrists (Council of Trent, Sess. VI, 
Cans. 11.12. 20). 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


688 


Here, moreover, the impious opponent of Christ performs 
lying works, signs, and wonders and “with all deceivableness of 
unrighteousness” and with “strong delusions” misleads uncounted 
souls into damnation, Gal. 3,10; 5, 4. 

Here, too, we find the greatest apostasy, concealed by an out¬ 
ward show of piety, the most consummate hypocrisy, veiled with 
the cloak of discipleship, and the most vicious hatred against 
Christ and His blessed Gospel, hidden under the pretentious names 
of “vicar of Christ,” “viceregent of Christ,” etc. 

Here, within the Christian Church, we find the crassest 
paganism (the worship of saints and statues, work-righteousness) 
and the ruthless shedding of the innocent blood of thousands of 
martyrs, who in true Christian faith and zeal opposed this anti- 
christian paganism. 

Here we find the revealing and consuming of Antichrist by the 
spirit of the Lord’s mouth, that is to say, the branding of the Pope 
as the Antichrist by the Lutheran Reformation. 

Here, lastly, we find that arrogant presumption over against 
all existing governments, which is a true characteristic of Anti¬ 
christ, the man of sin and the son of perdition, who “exalteth 
himself above all that is called God.” 

Our Lutheran Confession therefore rightly declares that the 
Pope at Rome is the Antichrist. “The marks [all the vices] of 
Antichrist plainly agree with the kingdom of the Pope and his 
adherents. For Paul, 2 Thess. 2, 3, in describing to the Thessa- 
lonians Antichrist, calls him an adversary of Christ, who opposeth 
and exalteth himself above all that is called God. . . . He speaks 
therefore of one ruling in the Church, not of heathen kings, and 
he calls this one the adversary of Christ, because he will devise 
doctrines conflicting with the Gospel and will assume to himself 
divine authority.” ( Smalcald Articles; Triglotta, p. 515, § 39.) 

Again (p. 517, § 41): “This being the case, all Christians 
ought to beware of becoming partakers of the godless doctrine, 
blasphemies, and unjust cruelty of the Pope. On this account they 
ought to deseri and execrate the Pope with his adherents as the 
kingdom of Antichrist, just as Christ has commanded Matt. 7,15: 
‘Beware of false prophets.’ And Paul commands that godless 
teachers should be avoided and execrated as cursed, Gal. 1, 8; 
Titus 3, 10. And in 2 Cor. 6, 14 he says: ‘Be ye not unequally 
yoked together with unbelievers; for what communion hath light 
with darkness?” (Cp. also Luther, St. L., XVII, 2191; XVIII 
1529 ff.) 



684 


THE DOCTRINE OP THE PUBLIC MINISTRY. 


The doctrine of our Confession " papam esse ipsum verum 
aniichristum” (Smalcald Articles; Triglotta, p. 474, § 10) has 
been denied on the ground that in 2 Thess. 2, 3—12 the apostle is 
speaking, not of a system of teaching, but of an individual deceiver. 
But this objection does not hold, since St. Paul here describes 
“a mystery of iniquity” which was active already in his time and 
which will endure to the end of time, w. 7. 8. 

If modern Protestant theologians fail to recognize that the 
Pope at Borne is the Antichrist, it is because they themselves do 
not understand what an abomination it is to reject God’s Word 
as the only source and standard of faith and to anathematize 
the doctrine of justification by faith. Since the Papacy destroys the 
central article of the Christian faith, its outward adherence to the 
Apostles’ Creed is only one of the many lies by which it deceives 
the unwary. To these lies belong also the many “good works” of 
which it boasts. Luther rightly says (St. L., XVIII, 1530): “The 
Papacy is a kingdom which destroys both faith and the Gospel.” 

The question whether individual Popes may personally be be¬ 
lievers in Christ may hardly be answered in the affirmative, since 
each Pope is the head of an antichristian cult which officially and 
permanently anathematizes the article of justification by faith. 
Also the “pious Popes” belong to the “lying wonders” by which 
Satan deceives those who do not love the truth. 

While the doctrine concerning Antichrist is not a fundamental 
teaching of Scripture, since no one is saved inasmuch as he recog¬ 
nizes the Antichrist, nevertheless we must not regard it as of little 
importance, since God has imparted this truth to us for doctrine 
and reproof, 2 Tim. 3,16. As St. Paul warned his hearers against 
Antichrist, so to-day Christian ministers should warn their hearers 
against him, 2 Thess. 2, 3. 5. Hence for a minister to claim that 
he is unable to recognize Antichrist shows a weakness and dulness 
in Christian discernment of which he has no reason whatever to be 
proud, 2 Thess. 2,13—15. 

If discerning believers recognized the Pope as the Antichrist 
even before the Reformation (Savonarola, Huss, Wyclif), we should 
do so all the more since God has revealed the Wicked (2 Thess. 2, 8) 
through His work of the Reformation, by which He restored to His 
Church both Holy Scripture as the sole source of faith (the formal 
principle of the Reformation) and justification by grace through 
faith as the sinner’s only hope of salvation (the material principle 
of the Reformation). Luther: "Deus impleat vos odio Papae!" 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


585 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 

(De Electlone Aetema sive de Praedestinatione.) 

The doctrine of eternal election has been treated by our dog- 
maticians at various places in their dogmatic treatises (in connec¬ 
tion with the doctrine of divine grace, Quenstedt, Hollaz; or with 
that of salvation in Christ, Baier). If the doctrine of election is 
taught in its Scriptural truth, it does not matter at what place in 
a dogmatic treatise it is presented. 

Nevertheless, since the doctrine of election is not a central 
article of faith, but is given, in the main, for the consolation of 
the believers, and since also, as the Formula of Concord observes 
(Epit., XI, 11), we should proceed in the study of God’s predesti¬ 
nation “according to the order which St. Paul has observed in the 
Epistle to the Bomans, who first directs men to repentance, to 
knowledge of sins, to faith in Christ, to divine obedience, before 
he speaks of the mystery of the eternal election of God,” we prefer 
to place it after the discussion of the doctrines of sin and grace, 
repentance and faith, so that the student may consider it with all 
the facts and consolatory promises of the Gospel well in mind. 

1. DEFINITION OF THE TERM. 

The central teaching of Scripture is the comforting doctrine 
of God’s grace in Christ Jesus toward fallen and lost mankind, 
Horn. 3, 23. 24; Eph. 2, 8. 9. To this divine grace the Christian 
owes his conversion, justification, sanctification, and preservation 
in faith, 2 Tim. 1,9; Titus 3, 7; 1 Cor. 15,10. That is the doc¬ 
trine of the sola gratia , which Scripture teaches so plainly and 
consolingly. 

To this doctrine Holy Scripture adds the comforting truth 
that whatever spiritual blessings God confers upon believers in 
time He in His infinite grace has decreed to bestow upon them 
from eternity. Accordingly we find in Scripture also the doctrine 
of eternal election. 

The doctrine of election may be summarized in the words: 
Election is the eternal act of God with respect to all who are saved, 
by which, out of pure grace and for Christ’s sake (Praedestinatio 
gratuita et libera est), He purposed to endow them in time with 
the spiritual blessings of conversion, justification, sanctification, 
and preservation unto life eternal. This definition embraces all 
divine truths which Scripture presents in connection with the doc¬ 
trine of eternal election.

THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


The doctrine of election centers in the consolatory message that 
whatever spiritual blessings God’s saints receive in time He has 
graciously decreed for them from eternity, 2 Tim. 1, 9; Acts 
13, 48; 2 Thess. 2,13.14; Eph. 1, 3—6; Korn. 8, 28—30. 

Thus to God’s eternal election of grace, or to His gracious 
purpose (xaz’ Idiav ngo&eoiv xal x<*Q lv )> without any consideration 
whatever of their works (“not according to our works”), Scripture 
ascribes the vocation, or calling, of the believers, 2 Tim. 1, 9. To 
God’s gracious election, Scripture ascribes their faith (Acts 13,48: 
“As many as were ordained to eternal life believed,” oooi gaav 
TErayjuivot rig gcogv ahbviov). To God’s gracious election Scrip¬ 
ture ascribes their “obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ” 
(2 Thess. 2,13.14: “Because God hath from the beginning chosen 
you to salvation,” ozi elXazo vfzdg 6 §eog an’ agxgs acozrjgiav). 
To God’s gracious election (“According as He hath chosen us in 
Him before the foundation of the world,” xadwg l£eXi£azo fjfidg 
iv avzco ngo xaza^oXijg xoo/uov) Scripture ascribes “all spiritual 
blessings in heavenly places in Christ,” with which God endows 
the believers in time, Eph. 1, 3—6. To God’s gracious election 
(zotg xaza ngo&eoiv xkgzotg) Scripture ascribes the comforting fact 
that all things must work together for good to them that love God; 
for they are called, justified, and glorified because He predestinated 
them, oD? d'e ngoibgioev zovzovg xal ixaXeoev, Bom. 8, 28—30. 

Holy Scripture thus traces all the spiritual blessings of con¬ 
version, justification, sanctification, and preservation back to God’s 
eternal election of grace in Christ Jesus. In this life and in the 
life to come believers receive nothing but what God before the 
foundation of the world decreed to give them in His beloved Son. 
The believing remnant (to Xifiua) in Israel is a “remnant according 
to the election of grace ” xaz’ ixXoyfjv ^dgizog, Bom. 11, 5. 

In order that no one may doubt that this election is entirely 
of grace and in no way of works, the apostle adds: “And if by 
grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more 
grace,” Rom. 11, 6. Indeed, he shows that Israel, which sought 
salvation by works, did not obtain it; for he writes: “Israel hath 
not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath 
obtained it (?) dk ixXoyrj inhvxev) and the rest were blinded,” 
Bom. 11, 7. 

The works of the believers are not a meritorious cause of 
their election of grace; for the apostle expressly declares: “For 
the children, being not yet born, neither having done any good 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


587 


or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, 
not of works, but of Him that calleth (tva j) xai’ IxXoyrjv ngodsois 
tod t feov fihfl, ovx igyojv, dXX’ ix tov xaXovvxog), it was said 
unto her. The elder shall serve the younger,” Rom. 9,11.12. 

So definitely and unmistakably Scripture ascribes all the spir¬ 
itual and heavenly blessings of the believers to God’s eternal elec¬ 
tion in Christ that no doubt whatever can remain with respect to 
this truth. 

The Formula of Concord acknowledges this fact in its full 
Scriptural content when it writes (Epit., XI, 5): “The predesti¬ 
nation, or eternal election of God, extends only over the godly, 
beloved children of God, being a cause of their salvation (haec est 
causa ipsorum salutis), which He also provides as well as disposes 
what belongs thereto. Upon this [predestination of God] our 
salvation is founded so firmly that the gates of hell cannot over¬ 
come it, John 10,28; Matt. 16,18.” 

Two basic truths, then, must be borne in mind whenever the 
article of eternal election of grace is being considered: — 

a. God’s eternal election of grace did not take place in view 
of man’s foreseen final faith (electio intuitu fidei finalis), but 
rather embraced this faith together with the whole way of salva¬ 
tion (ordo salutis, media salutis), such as conversion, justification, 
sanctification, and final preservation. Hence the believer is noil 
elected because of his foreseen faith (ex praevisa fide finali); 
on the contrary, he has become a believer in time because of his 
eternal election to salvation. In other words, a person is brought 
to saving faith in time just because God from eternity has gra¬ 
ciously elected him to salvation, Acts 13, 48; Eph. 1, 3—6; 
Rom. 8, 28—30. 

So also the Formula of Concord testifies (Thor. Decl., XI, 8): 
“The eternal election of God, however, not only foresees and fore¬ 
knows the salvation of the elect, but is also, from the gracious will 
and pleasure of God in Christ Jesus, a cause which procures, works, 
helps, and promotes our salvation and what pertains thereto 

What the Formula of Concord means by the words “a cause 
which procures, works, helps, and promotes our salvation and what 
pertains thereto” it further explains when it says (ibid., 14): “The 
entire doctrine concerning the purpose, counsel, will, and ordina¬ 
tion of God pertaining to our redemption, call, justification, and 
salvation should be taken together.” 

That again, as the Formula of Concord shows, means that 



588 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


“God in His purpose and counsel ordained: 1) that the human 
race is truly redeemed and reconciled with God through Christ... ; 
2) that such merit and benefits of Christ shall be presented, offered, 
and distributed to us through His Word and Sacraments; 3) that 
by His Holy Ghost, through the Word, . . . He will be efficacious 
and active in us, convert hearts to true repentance, and preserve 
them in the true faith; 4) that He will justify all those who in 
true repentance receive Christ by a true faith ... ; 5) that He will 
also sanctify in love those who are thus justified ... ; 6) that He 
also will protect them in their great weakness . . . and preserve 
them [for life eternal]; 7) that He will also strengthen, increase, 
and support to the end the good work which He has begun in them 
if they adhere to God’s Word, pray diligently, abide in God’s good¬ 
ness [grace], and faithfully use the gifts received; 8) that finally 
He will eternally save and glorify in life eternal those whom He 
has elected, called, and justified” (ibid., 14—22). 

God’s eternal election of grace thus embraces the whole order 
of salvation (ordo salutis) by which the sinner comes to faith and 
is preserved in faith to the end, Rom. 8, 28—30. 

b. With respect to the doctrine of election all those are sure 
to err who reject the sola gratia and so teach that a sinner is saved 
(elected and converted) not by grace alone, but also by some 
good quality or worthiness in him (aliquid in homine; aliqua causa 
discriminis) which God foresaw and on account of which He elected 
him (synergism). Similarly also those err with respect to this 
doctrine who teach that God’s eternal election of grace consisted 
merely in the appointment of the means of grace (ordinatio 
mediorum — election in a under sense, used in this sense by the 
errorists). 

While the Formula of Concord clearly states that God’s eternal 
election of grace embraces the way of salvation (ordo salutis; 
media salutis), it emphatically declares that the eternal election 
of grace was not merely a predestination of the means of salvation, 
but “of each and every person of the elect who are to be saved 
through Christ.” 

Our Confession says (ibid., 23): “In this counsel, purpose, 
and ordination God has prepared salvation not only in general, 
but has in grace considered and chosen to salvation each and every 
person of the elect who are to be saved through Christ, also or¬ 
dained that in the way just mentioned He will by His grace, gifts, 
and efficacy bring them thereto.” 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


589 


We therefore rightly say that God’s eternal election of grace 
is properly a predestination of persons to be saved through faith 
by the means of grace (Eph. 1,4: l£eU£axo fifxas; 1 Pet. 1, 1: 
IxXexxoig naQemdrjjuois). 

Summarizing all points of importance that may be considered 
under the head “Definition of the Term,” we may say: The elec¬ 
tion of grace is an election of persons (Personenwahl), not an elec¬ 
tion of the means of salvation (ordinatio mediorum); nor is it the 
ordination of the ordo salutis nor the divine decree that all who 
persevere in faith till the end shall be saved, Eph. 1,4; 2 Thess. 
2,13; Matt. 24, 24. Election is not general (error of Huber), but 
particular, Eph. 1,4; Matt. 20,16. It is an election of individuals 
(Einzelwahl), which must be held against all who teach that 
election does not refer to individual persons, but to the Church in 
general, Eph. 1, 4. It does not embrace temporary believers, but 
.only those who actually obtain eternal salvation, Matt. 24, 24; 
Rom. 8, 28—30. 

2. HOW BELIEVERS ARE TO CONSIDER THEIR ELECTION. 

The Formula of Concord very earnestly urges all believers “to 
think and speak correctly and profitably concerning the eternal 
election, or the predestination and ordination of the children of 
God to eternal life” (ibid., 13); for “if any one presents the doc¬ 
trine concerning the gracious election of God in such a manner 
that troubled Christians cannot derive comfort from it, but are 
thereby incited to despair, or that the impenitent are confirmed in 
their wantonness, it is undoubtedly sure and true that such a doc¬ 
trine is taught not according to the Word and will of Ood, but 
according to [the blind judgment of human] reason and the insti¬ 
gation of the devil” (ibid., 91). 

Since Satan desires to mislead souls into despair or carnal 
security also by the misapplication of the doctrine of God’s gra¬ 
cious election, the Formula of Concord gives this advice to all 
believers: “We should accustom ourselves not to speculate con¬ 
cerning the bare, secret, concealed, inscrutable foreknowledge of 
God, but how the counsel, purpose, and ordination of God in Christ 
Jesus, who is the true Book of Life, is revealed to us through the 
Word” (ibid., 13. 14). 

Even Luther complains that the doctrine of eternal election 
filled him with terror as long as he thought incorrectly and un- 
profitably of it (St. L., II, 182). Afterwards, however, when he 



590 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


had learned to understand the Gospel of God’s free grace in Christ 
Jesus, the doctrine of election gave him abiding comfort. 

In what light, then, should believers consider their election? 
Prom a close study of all passages concerned, it is clear that the 
holy apostles consistently employ the doctrine of election distinctly 
for the purpose of comforting the believers. In the manner there¬ 
fore in which they present the doctrine, it never terrifies, but always 
inspires and consoles. 

Indeed, the doctrine of eternal election is used by them to 
arouse in their hearers supreme joy and sincere thanksgiving to 
God. (Eph. 1, 3: " Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord 
Jesus Christ.” Rom. 8, 28—30: “All things work together for 
good to them . . . who are called according to His purpose" 
1 Pet. 1, 2. 3: “Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the 
Father. . . . Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. Blessed 
be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,” etc.) 

It is true, our divine Savior used the doctrine of election also 
for a warning; in both cases, however, He had in mind not true 
believers, but the self-righteous, who either demanded salvation as 
a due reward for their works. Matt. 20, 1—16, or rejected His 
righteousness and came to the King’s wedding without the proper 
wedding-garment, Matt. 22, 2—14. 

Christ’s warning "Many are called, but few are chosen” is 
therefore a most earnest plea to accept the free salvation of grace 
which God has prepared for all sinners in Him. Or we may say: 
It is the most earnest exhortation to accept with true faith the 
merits of Christ offered freely to all in the means of grace, the 
Gospel and the Sacraments. 

Christ’s words are in this manner properly applied because 
God’s eternal election of grace embraces the means of grace, by 
which each and every chosen person is saved. Hence, if we wish 
to be sure of our election and salvation, we must trust in the grace 
of God offered to all men in the Gospel and not confide in our own 
works, or merits. 

From this, then, we learn how we should consider our election 
properly and for our comfort. Holy Scripture states explicitly that 
God has elected us “in Christ Jesus," Eph. 1, 3—6, “to salvation 
through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling 
of the blood of Jesus Christ,” 1 Pet. 1, 2, etc. 

In other words, as the Formula of Concord rightly says, we 
should not speculate concerning the bare, secret, concealed, in- 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


591 


scrutable foreknowledge of God, but consider our election in Christ 
Jesus, who is the true Book of Life. However, “this Christ calls 
to Himself all sinners and promises them rest, and He is in earnest 
[seriously wills] that all men should come to Him and suffer them¬ 
selves to be helped, to whom He offers Himself in His Word and 
wishes them to hear it and not to stop their ears or [neglect and] 
despise the Word. Moreover, He promises the power and working 
of the Holy Ghost and divine assistance for perseverance and eternal 
salvation [that we may remain steadfast in the faith and attain 
eternal salvation].” (Epit., XI, 8.) 

Here, then, the Formula of Concord points out the true way 
in which Christian believers should consider their election. 

In the first place, they should believe Christ’s glorious Gospel 
invitation to come unto Him and be saved, Matt. 11,28; John 6, 
35—37; 10, 27—29. In other words, they should trust in Christ 
and sincerely believe that He, for the sake of His blood shed on 
Calvary, will forgive all their sins and receive them into eternal 
life, Gal. 2, 20; 1 Tim. 2, 4—6; 2 Tim. 4,18; 1,12. 

In the second place, from the cross of Calvary, which guaran¬ 
tees everlasting salvation to every believer in Christ, Christians 
should direct their attention to the eternal grace of God, who 
before the foundation of the world planned a perfect redemption 
for the whole world and thus a most sure salvation in the blessed 
Redeemer for every lost and condemned sinner (gratia universalis), 
Eph. 1, 3—6; 1 Tim. 2, 4; Rom. 8, 28—30; 2 These. 2, 13; 
1 Pet. 1, 2—5. 

Hence, as Christians firmly believe that they are saved by 
Christ, so they should believe also that they are God's elect in 
Christ Jesus; for so Scripture speaks consistently: “God has 
chosen you to salvation,” 2 These. 2,13; “He hath chosen us in 
Him,” Eph. 1, 4, etc. 

Christians should therefore assuredly believe that they are 
God’s chosen saints in Christ Jesus. 

Just that is what the Formula of Concord means when it 
writes (Epit., XI, 7) : “But the Word of God leads us to Christ, 
who is the Book of Life, in whom all are written and elected that 
are to be saved in eternity.” As long as believers so view their 
election in Christ Jesus, it will be to them a cause of great joy 
and a source of true comfort. 

On the other hand, if Christians view their election from reason 
(ex rationis nostrae sententia; ex ulla aliqua externa specie) or 



592 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


from the inscrutable hidden will of God (ex arcano consilio Dei), 
they will be misled either into despair or into an epicurean life. 
Of this the Formula of Concord writes (Epit., XI, 9): “Therefore 
we should judge concerning this our election to eternal life neither 
from reason nor from the Law of Qod, which lead us either into 
a reckless, dissolute, epicurean life or into despair and excite per¬ 
nicious thoughts in the hearts of men; for they cannot, as long as 
they follow their reason, successfully refrain from thinking: If Qod 
has elected me to salvation, I cannot be condemned, no matter 
what I do; and again: If I am not elected to eternal life, it is of 
no avail what good I do; it is all ... in vain anyway.” 

While the Formula of Concord condemns the way of judging 
election from reason, it condemns also what it calls the “sounding 
of the abyss of God’s hidden predestination” (Thor. Decl., XI, 33). 
Christians attempt to sound the abyss of God’s hidden predestina¬ 
tion when they ask the very irrelevant question: “If God has elected 
me to salvation, or if He has elected a few, why did He not 
elect all ?” (Cur alii prae aliis, cur alii, alii non f) The same irrel¬ 
evant question was put to Christ by His disciples when one of them 
asked: “Lord, are there few that be saved ?” That this query was 
one of the many unbecoming questions which even believers some¬ 
times put in their folly and ignorance. Acts 1, 6. 7, Christ showed 
by answering the inquisitive disciple: “Strive to enter in at the 
strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in and 
shall not be able,” Luke 13, 23. 24. 

To understand this reproof of Christ, we must remember 
that the proper scope of Scripture is the salvation of sinners. 
It therefore confines its instruction to what is needful for men 
to know in order that they may be saved, John 5, 39; 2 Tim. 3,15. 
Questions which serve only to satisfy their curious reason, Chris¬ 
tians should avoid as conflicting with God’s sovereign majesty 
and their own salvation, Eom. 9, 19. 20; 11, 33—36; 2 Tim. 2, 
15.16; 1 Tim. 6,3—5. 

The Formula of Concord rightly declares (Thor. Decl., 
XI, 33): “With this revealed will of God we should concern our¬ 
selves, follow and be diligently engaged upon it, because through 
the Word, whereby He calls us, the Holy Ghost bestows grace, 
power, and ability to this end, and [we] should not [attempt to] 
sound the abyss of God’s hidden predestination, as it is written in 
Luke 13,24, where one asks: ‘Lord, are there few to be saved?’ 
and Christ answers: ‘Strive to enter in at the strait gate.’” 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


593 


Our Lutheran Confessions thus reject the Calvinistic error 
of “absolute election” and affirm that we are chosen in Christ 
(iv Xqiotw, Eph. 1,4; iv ayiaofug nvev/uarog xal niozei aXrj^dag, 
2 Thess. 2,13). That is to say, our election is based upon Christ's 
merit, and this, together with the sanctification of the Spirit and 
faith, is so interwoven with the act of eternal election that the use 
and effect of the means of grace are part and parcel of it. 

Hence we must not consider our election “in a bare manner” 
(nude), but as “the counsel, purpose, and ordination of God in 
Christ Jesus, who is the true Book of Life, is revealed to us through 
the Word” (ibid., 13. 14). “Those who according to the purpose 
are predestinated to an inheritance hear the Gospel, believe in 
Christ, pray and give thanks,” etc., and so have the Spirit’s own 
testimony “that they are children of God” (ibid., 30. 31). 

“The Eleventh Article of the Formula of Concord indeed 
speaks of God’s counsel of redemption, especially in the so-called 
Eight Points, 13—23. But by doing so, it does not teach an elec¬ 
tion in a wider sense (eine allgemeine Wahl, ordinatio mediorum). 
By this it rather teaches that election must not be considered nude, 
but in connection with the whole counsel of God, ‘pertaining to our 
redemption, call, justification, and salvation,’ § 14.” (Dr. Engelder, 
Dogmatical Notes.) 

3. THE OBJECTS OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 

According to Holy Scripture, God has not elected all men 
(error of Samuel Huber, f 1624) nor the steadfast believers 
(finaliter credentes) together with the temporary believers (error 
of the Tuebingen school and some modern theologians, J. A. Osi- 
ander, f 1697; Frank), but only those who are actually saved 
(praedestinatio est particularis). This follows from the clear 
teaching of Scripture that all the elect shall surely be saved 
(praedestinatio est immutabilis et infallibilis), Matt. 24,24; Rom. 
8, 28—30. The Formula of Concord writes (Thor. Decl., XI, 23): 
“God has in grace considered and chosen to salvation each and every 
person of the elect who are to be saved.” 

Those who deny the immutability and infallibility of election, 
teaching that the elect may be lost, make of predestination a mere 
divine foreknowledge (praescientia), which is determined by, or 
conditioned upon, man’s conduct in time. They thus deny the 
Scriptural doctrine of election in toto. 

Hence the term election is not used in Scripture, as some 

CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 38 



594 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


erroneously claim, in a widest sense (all men are elect), a wider 
sense (such as will be saved and temporary believers), and in 
a narrow sense (such as will be saved), but only in one sense, that 
is to say: “The predestination, or eternal election, of God extends 
only over the godly, beloved children of God, being a cause of their 
salvation” (Epit., XI, 5). 

Quite generally those who used the term election in a wider 
or a general sense erroneously confounded God’s eternal plan of 
salvation with His eternal election of grace. 

God’s general counsel of grace (Gottes allgemeiner Gnaden- 
wille, benevolentia Dei universalis) certainly extends over all sin¬ 
ners, 1 Tim. 2,4; but His eternal election of grace extends only 
over such as will be saved, Matt. 20,16; 22,14. 

The claim that also the Formula of Concord teaches an elec¬ 
tion in a wider sense is based upon the misunderstanding of those 
paragraphs (Thor. Decl., XI, 15—22) in which it describes the 
ordo salutis embraced in God’s eternal election. (Praedestinatio 
non est dbsoluta, sed ordinata, i. e., fundatur in Christo.) 

When determining the objects of eternal election, some dogma- 
ticians erroneously claimed that God’s eternal predestination con¬ 
sists in the general principle, or decree: “He that shall endure 
unto the end, the same shall be saved,” Matt. 24,13. While this 
general principle, or decree, is a truth which Scripture urges with 
much emphasis, John 3,18. 36, it must not be confounded with 
the divine decree of election, since according to Scripture not 
general principles, but persons have been chosen to salvation 
(2 Thess. 2,13: you; Eph. 1, 4: us). 

For this reason we reject also the following claims: a) that 
God’s eternal election is the ordination of the means of grace 
(ordinatio mediorum, called by some election in a wider sense); 
and b) that the object of God’s gracious election is the Church in 
general (Hofmann, Luthardt, Yilmar, Thomasius). The last claim 
involves a contradiction, since the Church is properly the “com¬ 
munion of saints” and therefore consists of individual persons. 

Holy Scripture, without any qualification whatever, describes 
all true believers as elect saints of God, Eph. 1,4; 2 Thess. 2,13; 
1 Thess. 1, 4; 1 Pet. 1, 2. Hence all sincere Christians should 
regard themselves as God’s elect through faith in Christ Jesus, 
Eom. 8, 33. 34. All those who claim that they cannot know 
whether they are chosen or not or who doubt their election should 
examine themselves if they really believe in Christ as their true 
and only Savior, 2 Cor. 13, 5. 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


595 


It is true, the believer can never become sure of his election 
and salvation as long as he considers the question from the view¬ 
point of God’s bare foreknowledge, since no one can definitely 
know just what God foreknew or foresaw in him (intuitu fidei 
finalis). The opinion that God has elected men in view of their 
final faith (ex praevisa fide finali) is neither Scriptural nor com¬ 
forting. It is not Scriptural, since there is not a shred of Scrip¬ 
ture proof for it. It is not comforting, since it takes the believer 
into the domain of God’s inscrutable and hidden will. For all 
practical purposes it is an impossible doctrine, lying, as it does, 
in the province of the unknowable. 

The Formula of Concord rightly argues with respect to the 
intuitu fidei finalis (Thor. Decl., XI, 54. 55): “There is no doubt 
that God most exactly and certainly foresaw (praeviderit) before 
the time of the world, and still knows (et hodie etiarn norit), 
which of those that are called will believe or will not believe; 
also which of the converted will persevere [in faith] and which 
will not persevere. . . . However, since God has reserved this 
mystery for His wisdom and has revealed nothing to us concerning 
it in His Word, much less commanded us to investigate it with our 
thoughts, but has earnestly discouraged us therefrom, Rom. 
11, 33 ff., we should not reason in our thoughts, draw conclusions, 
nor inquire curiously into these matters, but should adhere to His 
revealed Word, to which He points us.” 

This admonition is very pertinent; for we are sure of our 
election and salvation only if in true faith we cling to Christ, who 
has promised to receive all sinners and to give them rest, Matt. 
11, 28. It is only by faith in Christ that we may be sure of our 
election and salvation. 

Again, the believer cannot become sure of his election and 
salvation as long as he doubts or limits universal grace (gratia uni¬ 
versalis). The Formula of Concord rightly says (Thor. Decl., 
XI, 28) : “If we wish to consider our eternal election to salvation 
with profit, we must in every way hold sturdily and firmly to this, 
that, as the preaching of repentance, so also the promise of the 
Gospel is universalis (universal), that is, it pertains to all men, 
Luke 24, 47.” 

All who deny the gratia universalis (Calvinists) have no 
foundation on which to rest their faith; for if the promises of 
the Gospel are limited to only a few (the elect), how can we know 
whether or not we belong to the chosen few? 



596 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


However, not only the Calvinists limit the gratia universalis, 
but also the synergists, though in theory they acknowledge the uni¬ 
versality of divine grace. Actually, however, the synergists limit 
God’s saving grace to those who do not maliciously resist the Holy 
Spirit or who cooperate in their conversion. Hence neither Cal¬ 
vinism nor synergism can make any one sure of his election and 
salvation. 

Lastly, the believer cannot be sure of his election and salva¬ 
tion as long as he accounts for the difference why one is saved and 
the other is not (Cur alii, alii non?) by a “different conduct in 
men” (aliquid in homine, aliqua actio dissimilis in homine). 

This was the mistake of Melanchthon, who taught (Loci, 
1548): “Since the promise is universal, and since there are no 
contradictory wills in God, some cause of discrimination must be in 
us why Saul is rejected and David accepted; that is, there must 
be some dissimilar action in these two.” So also Pfeffinger ( Quaes - 
tiones Quinque, Thesis 23) : “We are elected and received because 
we believe in the Son.” Compare also the synergistic argument in 
general: “Since man’s contempt of God’s Word is the cause of his 
reprobation, man’s acceptance of God’s grace must be regarded as 
a cause of his election.” (Cp. Dr. Bente’s “Historical Introductions 
to the Symbolical Books,” Concordia Triglotta, p. 195ff.) This 
synergistic conception of election makes predestination a priori an 
election of merit and not of grace, Rom. 11, 5—7. 

Against the synergistic error the Formula of Concord writes 
(Thor. Decl., XI, 88) : “Therefore it is false and wrong [conflicts 
with the Word of God] when it is taught that not alone the mercy 
of God and the most holy merit of Christ, but that also in us there 
is a cause of God’s election (verum etiam aliquid in nobis causa 
sit electionis divinae) on account of which God has chosen us to 
eternal life. For not only before we had done anything good, but 
also before we were born, yea, even before the foundations of the 
world were laid, He elected us in Christ.” 

However, while neither Calvinism (denial of the gratia uni¬ 
versalis) nor synergism (denial of the sola gratia) can render any 
person certain of his election and salvation, such certainty is fully 
obtained by faith in the universal Gospel-promises of free grace; 
for these most gracious promises offer to all men most seriously 
and efficaciously (gratia seria et efficax) forgiveness of sins, life, 
and salvation for the sake of Christ, who shed His blood for the 
sins of the world, 1 John 2, 2; 4,10. In other words, every Chris-

tian should surely believe on the basis of Scripture that Jesus 
Christ has redeemed him, a lost and condemned sinner, purchased 
and won him from all sins, from death, and from the power of the 
devil . . . that he may be His own and live under Him in His 
kingdom and serve Him in everlasting righteousness, innocence, 
and blessedness. With respect to the gracious promise of God in 
Christ Jesus (John 3, 16—18) he should say with true faith: 
“This is most certainly true!” and rejoice in his election and 
salvation. 

That is the line of argument which St. Paul points out in 
Rom. 8, 32. 33, where he writes: “He that spared not His own Son, 
but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also 
freely give us all thingsf Who shall lay anything to the charge 
of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.” 

Following the apostle’s line of argument, every believer should 
confidently confess: “If God by grace has given me His only- 
begotten Son to be my Savior and has renewed my heart by His 
Holy Spirit through faith, pardoned my sins, and justified me by 
His grace, who shall prefer against me the charge that I am not 
His elect? Since Ood has justified me in Christ Jesus, I believe 
with all my heart that He has chosen me in Christ Jesus.” 

The certainty of election and salvation which follows such trust 
in the divine promises is of course not an absolute certainty in the 
sense that it rests upon a direct or immediate revelation of the 
Holy Ghost, but it is a certainty of faith and so a most blessed 
certainty; for divine faith is not doubt or uncertainty, but a most 
positive assurance wrought by the Holy Ghost through the Gospel 
(fides divina). 

This divine certainty St. Paul describes in these memorable 
words: “I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, 
nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to 
come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able 
to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, our 
Lord,” Rom. 8, 38. 39. The true believer is persuaded of his elec¬ 
tion and salvation because the Holy Ghost Himself persuades him 
of this by faith through the Gospel, 2 Tim. 1,12. 

With respect to the numerous warnings against apostasy, which 
Holy Scripture addresses also to the believers, we must remember 
that they pertain to Christians only inasmuch as they are flesh 
(odpf). Hence these warnings and admonitions belong to the 
preaching of the Law, which works knowledge of sin also in the 



598 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


believer, Kom. 3, 20. But they do not pertain to the believer inas¬ 
much as he is a new creature in Christ (2 Cor 5,17: xaivrj xxlaig) 
and as such "presses towards the mark for the prize of the high 
calling of God in Christ Jesus,” Phil. 3,12—14. 

As a new man in Christ (xeuvoc &v&Qconog), who longs for 
eternal life, Phil. 3, 20. 21, a Christian must entirely forget the 
threatenings of the divine Law, 1 Tim. 1, 9, and comfort himself 
with the gracious promises of the Gospel, Bom. 10,4; Gal. 3,13; 
2,19; Bom. 6,14. The warnings of the Law apply to him only 
inasmuch as sin still cleaves to him, Bom. 7, 18—25; 1 Cor. 
10,12, or inasmuch as he is still inclined to set aside the goal of 
eternal salvation and to love this present world, 1 Cor. 10,1—6; 
1 John 2,14—17. 

As warnings of the Law we must consider also the frequent 
references in Scripture to temporary believers, Luke 8, 13; Hos. 
6,4; 2 Tim. 4,10. Temporary believers fall from grace because 
they disbelieve the Gospel, by which the Holy Ghost engenders and 
preserves faith, 1 Pet. 1, 5. Hence the fault of their damnation is 
theirs and not God’s, 2 Tim. 1, 13. 14 ; 2 Thess. 3, 3. God’s un¬ 
qualified promise to all believers reads: “Whosoever believeth on 
Him shall not be ashamed,” Bom. 10,11. 

For this reason Christians should never doubt their election 
and salvation, but through diligent use of the means of grace hold 
fast to the hope of eternal life which is in Christ Jesus, John 
10, 27. 28. 

4. THE RELATION OF FAITH TO ETERNAL ELECTION. 

With regard to the important question, which has been in 
controversy ever since the sixteenth century: “In what relation 
does faith stand to election ?” we must bear in mind that notionally 
(notionaliter, begrifflich) Scripture places faith neither before nor 
after election. 

Faith was placed before election by all the later Lutheran theo¬ 
logians who taught that God elected those who will be saved, in 
view of their foreseen faith (intuitu fidei finaiis). 

Faith is placed after election by the Calvinists, who teach that 
faith, the same as Christ’s redemption, is merely the execution of 
God’s eternal, absolute (arbitrary) decree of predestination. 

As a matter of fact, the right relation of faith to eternal elec¬ 
tion is this, that saving faith, wrought by the Holy Ghost, belongs 
into election as the means by which the object of election is accom- 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


599 


plished. In other words, God in His eternal counsel of grace 
decreed to save His elect saints through faith in Christ Jesus, 
Eph. 1, 3—8; 1 Pet. 1,2; or we may say, from eternity He gra¬ 
ciously endowed the elect with faith and thereby separated them 
from the lost world (massa perdita). 

Of this the Formula of Concord writes (Thor. Decl., XI, 44) : 
“God in His counsel, before the time of the world, decided and 
ordained that He Himself, by the power of the Holy Ghost, would 
produce and work in us, through the Word, everything that per¬ 
tains to our conversion.” So also Dr. Walther declares: “We teach 
that God, as He saves us in time through faith, so also from eternity 
He decreed to save the elect through faith; and just this, according 
to Scripture, our Confessions, and our doctrine, is the decree of 
eternal predestination. ... We believe, teach, and confess accord¬ 
ing to Scripture and our Confession that God has chosen us to 
salvation through faith.” (Christl. Dogmatik, III, 548ff.) 

Since, then, God has chosen the elect unto faith in Christ, we 
regard the faith which the elect receive in time, just as their whole 
state of grace, which follows such faith, also as the effect, or result, 
of their eternal election (2 Tim. 1, 9 : “who hath called us according 
to His own purpose and grace”; Acts 13, 48: “As many as were 
ordained to eternal life believed”). Faith, then, according to Scrip¬ 
ture is rightly viewed both as the effect of election and as the means 
by which its purpose is accomplished. Chemnitz writes ( Enchi¬ 
ridion., p. 109): “The election of God does not follow after our 
faith and righteousness, but precedes it as a cause of all this.” 
And the Formula of Concord says (Thor. Decl., XI, 8): “The 
eternal election of God ... is also, from the gracious will and 
pleasure of God in Christ Jesus, a cause which procures, works, 
helps, and promotes our salvation and what pertains thereto.” 

From this doctrine of Scripture and the Lutheran Confession 
the later Lutheran dogmaticians (since Hunnius, f 1603) departed, 
teaching that God elected such as are saved in view of their fore¬ 
seen final faith (intuitu fidei fitialis, ex praevisa fide finali). 
This view they sought to justify by taking the verb foreknow 
(Horn. 8, 29: ngoeyvco) in the sense of knowing before or seeing 
before (nudam scientiam denotans). 

Accordingly they interpreted St. Paul’s statement in Kom. 
8, 29 thus: “Whose final faith He foreknew or foresaw (quorum 
fidem finalem praescivit sive praevidit) He also did predestinate” 
0 *ai 7igodbgioEv). This explanation has been adopted by some 



600 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


modern exegetes (Philippi), who accepted the intuitu-fidei theory 
either on synergistic grounds or on account of its supposed greater 
dearness and fitness. 

But to substitute the words quorum fidem finalem praescivit 
sive praevidit for the plain words of the apostle "whom He did 
foreknou/’ (o0? ngoeyvco) is a violation of the text, since it forces 
upon the statement of the apostle something that it does not 
express (eisegesis). St. Paul does not say: “whose final faith He 
foreknew,” but: "whom He foreknew.” The object of “He fore¬ 
knew” ( ngoeyva>) is not faith, but a certain number of persons, 
whom the apostle calls “the called according to His purpose,” v. 28. 

In addition to this, the intuitu-fidei theory is directly anti- 
Scriptural, since Holy Scripture plainly teaches that the faith 
which the elect receive in time is not the cause, but rather the 
effect of election, Acts 13, 48; Matt. 24, 21—24. 

For “final faith” other exegetes substitute in this passage good 
works (Ambrose: quorum merita praescivit), or love (Weiss, 
Ebrard), or the good conduct (facultas se applicandi ad gratiam, 
voluntas non repugnans, sed assentiens, Melanchthon), in short, 
some good quality of the elect, which explains why some were 
chosen and others were not (Cur alii, alii non?). 

Over against this synergistic interpretation, Luther, as also 
the Formula of Concord, regarded the verb to know or foreknow as 
used in a peculiar sense, which it frequently has in Scripture 
(Luther: zuvorversehen, to determine beforehand; the Formula 
of Concord: in Onaden bedenken, graciously to consider; clemen- 
ter praescire, graciously to foreknow; Luthardt: ein aneignendes 
Zuvorerkennen, an appropriating foreknowing; others: sich zu 
eigen machen, to make a person one’s own; sich verbinden, to join 
some one to oneself). 

In this sense yivoboxeiv, following the use of the Hebrew ITV 
(cp. Deut. 7, 6 with Amos 3, 2), is used in Gal. 4, 9: “After that ye 
have known God, or rather are known of Cod”; Rom. 11, 2: “God 
hath not cast away His people which He foreknew”; 1 Cor. 8, 3: 
“If any man love God, the same is known of Him.” 

In all these and many other passages of Scripture the verb to 
know or to foreknow does not designate mere knowledge, but 
a knowledge joined with love (nosse cum affectu et effectu), so 
that the person thus known of God is made His own and acknowl¬ 
edged by Him as His own. In this sense we take the verb ngotyvai 
in Rom. 8,29, since, on the one hand, the direct object of did fore- 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


001 


know is the relative pronoun whom, which refers to persons and 
does not mean "whose faith” or whose "better conduct” He foresaw, 
and since, on the other, the grammatical antecedent of whom (ove) 
is the definite number of God’s saints who are "called according to 
His purpose,” v. 28. 

The sense of v. 29, then, is: "Whom He did graciously deter¬ 
mine beforehand according to His purpose (welche er aber zuvor- 
versehen hat). He also did predestinate.” 

To the objection that this would constitute an inexcusable 
tautology (Hunnius, Philippi) we reply that this conclusion does 
not follow. 

Even if we should take ngoyivdioxeiv as a synonym of 
jigoogl£eiv, the sentence would not be tautological, but only pro¬ 
gressive in thought; for it would then say: ‘‘Whom God did choose 
before, them also He really did predestinate,” sc., “to be conformed 
to the image of His Son.” 

In other words, the thought would then indeed be repeated, 
yet not uselessly, but to connect it with the new and very impor¬ 
tant truth: "to be conformed to the image of His Son.” 

However, we may distinguish between the meaning of 
ngoyivcooxeiv and ngoogi^eiv in this manner: the first verb ex¬ 
presses the loving appropriation of the elect (die liebende Aneig- 
nung der Auserwaehlten); the second, their predestination to 
conformity to the image of His Son. 

We thus distinguish in God’s eternal decree logically a two¬ 
fold gracious action, namely, first, a loving appropriation of the 
elect and, secondly, the actual predestination of the elect, though 
really (sachlich) the two coincide. 

The doctrine of intuitu fidei (the so-called "second form”) 
has no Scriptural foundation whatever, since Holy Scripture teaches 
directly that nothing moved God to elect His saints to salvation 
except His infinite grace in Christ Jesus. The reason why “the 
second form” was introduced into the theology of the Church was 
that it was regarded as necessary to explain the reason why 
some were chosen and others not. Its advocates decided to remove 
the difficulty that, if divine grace is universal (gratia universalis) 
and all men by nature are in equal guilt (in eadem culpa) and 
depend alone on divine grace for salvation (sola gratia), it is im¬ 
possible to explain the mystery why some are predestinated to life 
and others not (particular election). 

Hence the intuitu-fidei theory is intelligible only if it is taken 



602 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


in a synergistic sense, that is, if it is understood in the synergistic 
meaning that by nature not all men are in the same guilt and 
therefore salvation is not alone by grace. 

That is indeed an explanation of the mystery of election, but 
one that opposes Scripture and denies the fundamental article of 
the Christian faith, the sola gratia. It is the same anti-Scriptural 
explanation concerning which Luther wrote to Erasmus: "Thou 
hast seized me by the throat, Iugulum meum petisti.” 

It is true, not all dogmaticians who taught the intuitu fidei 
were synergists; but the theory lends itself so readily to the sup¬ 
port of synergism that it should not be used by those who do not 
mean to be synergists. 

5. THE PURPOSE OF THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL 

ELECTION. 

According to Holy Scripture it is not the purpose of the doc¬ 
trine of eternal election to deny or limit the gratia universalis 
(Calvin and others), but rather to inculcate the sola gratia. In 
other words, it should induce Christian believers, whenever they 
compare themselves with unbelievers, to ascribe their state of grace 
not to their own praiseworthy conduct (synergism, Pelagianism), 
but solely to divine grace in Christ Jesus (divine monergism). 
This emphasis on the sola gratia is indeed necessary; for if Chris¬ 
tians ascribe their salvation to their good conduct, or worthiness, 
even only in part, they are fallen from grace and are under the 
divine curse, Luke 18,9ff.; Gal. 3,10. 

This purpose of the doctrine of eternal election appears already 
from Israel’s election as the people of the Old Testament Church, 
which was typical of God’s eternal election of grace. When God 
led His people into the land of promise, He expressly declared: 
"Not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart 
dost thou go to possess their [the heathen nations’] land. . . . 
Understand therefore that the Lord, thy God, giveth thee not this 
good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiff¬ 
necked people,” Deut. 9, 5. 6. 

This same thought, "not for thy righteousness,” the doctrine 
of election impresses upon the believer in the New Testament. 
(2 Tim. 1,9: "God hath saved us . . . not according to our works, 
but according to His own purpose and grace”; Eph. 1, 5. 6: 
"having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus 
Christ to Himself according to the good pleasure of His will”; 
Eom. 11, 6: “If by grace, then it is no more of works.”) 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


603 


It is only when we keep this important truth in mind that 
we are able to understand chaps. 9—11 of St. Paul’s Epistle to 
the Eomans correctly. In these chapters the apostle indeed affirms 
the universal grace of God, Rom. 10, 21; 11, 32, but condemns the 
arrogance and pride of the self-righteous, who, when comparing 
themselves with those who are lost, regard themselves as better 
than they and so ascribe their salvation to their own worthiness, 
Rom. 9, 30—33; 11,18 ff. 

In agreement with these statements of Scripture the Formula 
of Concord writes (Thor. Decl., XI, 87. 88): “By this doctrine 
and explanation of the eternal and saving choice [predestination] 
of the elect children of God His own glory is entirely and fully 
given to God, that in Christ He saves us out of pure [and free] 
mercy, without any merits or good works of ours, according to the 
purpose of His will. . . . Therefore it is false and wrong [conflicts 
with the Word of God] when it is taught that not alone the mercy 
of God and the most holy merit of Christ, but that also in us 
there is a cause of God’s election on account of which God has 
chosen us to eternal life.” 

As a warning against self-righteousness our Lord employs the 
doctrine of eternal election in Matt. 20,1—16 and Matt. 22,1—14, 
where He reproves those who trust in their own righteousness and 
reject the sola gratia and the meritum Christi as the sole founda¬ 
tion of their eternal hope. 

While the doctrine of God’s eternal election in Christ Jesus 
is therefore a most earnest warning addressed to Christians inas¬ 
much as their flesh inclines to self-righteousness, it is a warning 
also, addressed to their secure and indifferent hearts, not to despise 
the means of grace, through which God’s grace in Christ Jesus is 
offered and conveyed to all sinners (Matt. 22,1—14: “And they 
would not come”). 

On this point the Formula of Concord writes very correctly 
(Thor. Decl., XI, 51) : “From this article also powerful admoni¬ 
tions and warnings are derived, as Luke 7, 30: ‘They rejected the 
counsel of God against themselves’; Luke 14,24: ‘I say unto you 
that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper’; 
Matt. 20, 16 : ‘Many be called, but few chosen’; also Luke 8 , 8 . 18 : 
‘He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,’ and: ‘Take heed how ye 
hear.’” 

Again (Thor. Decl., XI, 41. 42) : “Few receive the Word and 
follow it; the greater number despise the Word and will not come

THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


to the wedding, Matt. 22, 3ff. The cause of this contempt for the 
Word is not God’s foreknowledge [or predestination], but the per¬ 
verse will of man, which rejects or perverts the means and instru¬ 
ment of the Holy Ghost which God offers him through the call 
and resists the Holy Ghost, who wishes to be efficacious and works 
through the Word, as Christ says: ‘How often would I have gath¬ 
ered you together, and ye would not I’ Matt. 23, 37. Thus many 
‘receive the Word with joy, but afterward fall away again,’ 
Luke 8,13. But the cause is not as though God were unwilling to 
grant grace for perseverance to those in whom He has begun the 
good work, for that is contrary to St. Paul, Phil. 1, 6; but the cause 
is that they wilfully turn away again from the holy commandment 
[of God], grieve and embitter the Holy Ghost, implicate themselves 
again in the filth of the world, and garnish again the habitation 
of the heart for the devil. With them the last state is worse than 
the first, 2 Pet. 2, 10. 20; Eph. 4, 30; Heb. 10, 26; Luke 11, 25.” 

As Matt. 20,1—16 and 22,1—14, so we must view as a most 
earnest warning also the apostle’s admonition to give diligence to- 
make our calling and election sure, 2 Pet. 1,10. What the apostle 
here inculcates is that Christians should diligently use the means 
of grace, walk in obedience to God by faith in Christ Jesus, and 
so through the witness of the Holy Spirit (testimonium Spiritus 
Sancti) become subjectively sure of their state of grace and election. 
Gal. 5, 22—25. 

However, while it is a manifest purpose of the doctrine 
of eternal election to warn and exhort Christians to adhere to 
the sola gratia and not to despise the means of grace (Law¬ 
preaching addressed to Christians according to their Old Adam 
[naXaiog dv§Q<ojiogJ, Eph. 4, 22—24), the proper scope of the doc¬ 
trine is to bless all Christian believers with true comfort and 
abiding consolation. In this manner Scripture employs the doc¬ 
trine of election preeminently, Eph. 1, 3—6; Rom. 8, 28—30; 
1 Pet. 1, 2—6; for the proclamation of the sola gratia (sola fide) 
is by its very nature the sweetest and most consoling Gospel truth, 
John 3,16—18. 

In particular, the doctrine of God’s eternal election in Christ 
Jesus comforts the Christian believer in two ways: It shows him 
a) how very earnestly God desires the eternal salvation of every 
Christian, and b) how God at all times preserves His Church on 
earth against the fury of Satan, the onslaughts of the wicked world, 
and the deceitfulness of the believer’s own corrupt flesh (odg(). 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


605 


The Formula of Concord speaks very fittingly of this precious 
comfort when it says (Thor. Decl., XI, 45. 46): “Thus this 
doctrine affords also the excellent, glorious consolation that God 
was so greatly concerned about the conversion, righteousness, and 
salvation of every Christian and so faithfully purposed it . . . 
that, before the foundation of the world was laid. He deliberated 
concerning it and in His [secret] purpose ordained how He would 
bring me thereto [call and lead me to salvation] and preserve me 
therein; also, that He wished to secure my salvation so well and 
certainly that, since through the weakness and wickedness of our 
flesh it could easily be lost from our hands or through craft and 
might of the devil and the world be snatched and taken from us, 
He ordained it in His eternal purpose, which cannot fail or be 
overthrown, and placed it for preservation in the almighty hand 
of our Savior Jesus Christ, from which no one can pluck us, 
John 10, 28.” 

Again (ibid., 48. 49) : “Moreover, this doctrine affords glo¬ 
rious consolation under the cross and amid temptations, namely, 
that God in His counsel, before the time of the world, determined 
and decreed that He would assist us in all distresses [anxieties 
and perplexities], grant patience [under the cross], give consola¬ 
tion, excite [nourish and encourage] hope, and produce such an 
outcome as would contribute to our salvation. Also, as Paul in 
a very consolatory way treats this, Rom. 8, 28. 29. 35—39, that God 
in His purpose has ordained before the time of the world by what 
crosses and sufferings He would conform every one of His elect to 
the image of His Son and that to every one His cross shall and 
must work together for good, because they are called according to 
the purpose, whence Paul has concluded that it is certain and 
indubitable that neither tribulation nor distress, nor death, nor 
life, etc., shall be able to separate us from the love of God which 
is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.” 

Lastly (ibid., 50): “This article also affords a glorious testi¬ 
mony that the Church of God will exist and abide in opposition to 
all the gates of hell and likewise teaches which is the true Church 
of God, lest we be offended by the great authority [and majestic 
appearance] of the false Church, Rom. 9, 24. 25.” 

While the Formula of Concord thus points out, and impresses, 
the consolatory nature of the doctrine of eternal election to life, 
it shows also that, “when this consolation and hope are weakened 
or entirely removed by Scripture [by false Scriptural interpreta- 



606 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


tion, as that of Calvinism and synergism], it is certain that it is 
understood and explained contrary to the will and meaning of the 
Holy Ghost” (ibid., 92), so that, “if any one presents the doctrine 
concerning the gracious election of God in such a manner that 
troubled Christians cannot derive comfort from it, but are hereby 
incited to despair or that the impenitent are confirmed in their 
wantonness, it is undoubtedly sure and true that such a doctrine 
is taught not according to the Word and will of God, but according 
to [the blind judgment of human] reason and the instigation of 
the devil” (ibid., 91). 

To the believing Christian who rejoices in the sweet consola¬ 
tion of the blood-stained cross of Calvary and in its radiant light 
and glory views his own certain election and salvation “this doc¬ 
trine gives no cause either for despondency or for a shameless, 
dissolute life” (ibid., 89). 

6. HOLY SCRIPTURE TEACHES NO ELECTION 
TO DAMNATION. 

Calvinism argues very seriously that, since God has elected 
some to eternal life. He also must have elected others to eternal 
damnation. In other words, there must be an election of wrath 
(eine Zornwahl) to correspond to the election of grace ("die not- 
wendige Kehrseite," the necessary reverse side). 

The Lutheran denial of an eternal reprobation to damnation 
(electio aeterna, qua Deus . . . alios ad interitum praedestinavit) 
Calvin rebuked with the harshest terms (inscite nimis et pueriliter; 
plus quam insulse, Inst., Ill, 23, 1). 

So also the followers of Calvin designate the Scriptural posi¬ 
tion of the Formula of Concord on predestination as “untenable 
ground” (Hodge, Syst. Theol., II, 325). Shedd entirely ignores 
the Lutheran position and divides all Christians into Calvinists 
(denial of universal grace) and Arminians (denial of the sola 
gratia). In his system of theology there is no room for the Scrip¬ 
tural doctrine of eternal election as the Lutheran Church confesses 
it (Dogm. Theol., I, 448). 

However, Holy Scripture knows of no “reverse side” of God’s 
eternal election of grace; for while the one (election unto eternal 
life) is clearly taught in many passages, the other (election unto 
eternal damnation) is plainly repudiated. 

In Acts 13, 48 we are indeed told: “As many as were ordained 
to eternal life believed,” but this passage does not add: “As many 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


607 


as were ordained to eternal damnation believed not.” On the con¬ 
trary, it cites as the true reason why the others did not believe their 
wilful and perverse rejection of the proffered grace (v. 46: “Seeing 
ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting 
life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles”). The reason why some do not 
believe is stated clearly by Christ when He says of them: “Ye 
would not,” Matt. 23, 37. 38. 

In accord with this verdict of Holy Scripture the Lutheran 
Church teaches: All who are saved are saved by grace; but all who 
are lost are lost through their own perverse opposition to the Holy 
Ghost, Hos. 13, 9. Calvinism indeed declares that also to those 
whom He from eternity has reprobated to damnation God offers 
a certain kind of grace (common grace), while to His elect He 
offers “irresistible grace”; but this is only a new error, designed 
to confirm the error of eternal reprobation. Calvinism thus teaches 
contradictory wills in God; for by the outward call, extended to 
the non-elect, He wills their salvation, while according to His 
eternal decree of reprobation (horribile decretum), by which He 
reprobated the non-elect to damnation, He does not desire to 
save them. Scripture, on the contrary, plainly teaches that also 
those who reject the divine offer of grace are seriously called. Acts 
13, 38—41; Matt. 23, 37. 38: vocalio seria. 

Moreover, the fact that God hardens the hearts (Ex. 10, 1; 
5,1—23) of those who first harden themselves (voluntas Dei con- 
sequens) does not prove an eternal reprobation to damnation; for 
Scripture tells us expressly that the divine act of obduration is 
a measure of wrath and punishment which occurs as a “recompense” 
(et? dvianodojua, Rom. 11,9) for their resistance and rejection of 
divine grace. " Verstockung ist immer eine Folge der Selbst- 
verstochung” , 

It is true, Christian believers are by nature in the same guilt 
(in eadem culpa), Rom. 3, 22. 23, as are all other men, so that, if 
they should compare themselves with those who are lost, they are 
“just like them and in no way any better” (quarn simillimi depre- 
hensi), Ps. 51, 5; John 3, 5. 6; Eph. 2, 3. Hence they have no 
reason whatever to boast of their goodness and to ascribe their faith 
and salvation to their own worthiness, 1 Cor. 4, 7, but must praise 
and glorify the indescribable mercy of God, who out of pure grace 
has endowed them with spiritual life ( Formula of Concord, Thor. 
Decl., XI, 60). 

Nevertheless Holy Scripture assures us that God most seriously 



608 


THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


offers His grace also to those who resist His Spirit, Acts 13, 46, and 
harden their hearts against His divine Word, Acts 7, 51, indeed, 
that with much long-suffering He endures the vessels of wrath, fitted 
to destruction by their own hardness of heart, Rom. 9, 22. 23, to the 
end that they, too, might be converted and saved, 2 Pet. 3, 9; 
Rom. 2,4. 

Thus Scripture everywhere extols the unspeakable mercy of 
God, which offers grace and salvation also to those who are lost, 
and leaves no room whatever for a doctrine of eternal reprobation. 

With respect to the statement of St. Paul that “God endured 
with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction/’ 
Rom. 9, 22, the Formula of Concord rightly says (Thor. Decl., 
XI, 80) : “Here, then, the apostle clearly says that God endured 
with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath, but does not say 
that He made them vessels of wrath; for if this had been His will, 
He would not have required any great long-suffering for it. The 
fault, however, that they are fitted for destruction belongs to the 
devil and to men themselves and not to God.” 

God has indeed “afore prepared” (nooy)rouinorr) unto glory 
the vessels of mercy, Rom. 9,23, but not the vessels of wrath; 
for these, as the apostle plainly states, are “fitted to destruction” 
{xazTjQuo/ueva els dncoXeiav), sc., by their own perverseness. Accord¬ 
ing to Scripture, God earnestly desires the salvation of all men, 
John 1, 29; 3,16; 2 Pet. 2,1. “Hell was originally not built for 
men.” If men enter into it, it is because of their own wicked rejec¬ 
tion of divine grace (cp. Matt. 25, 34: “Come, ye blessed of My 
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation 
of the world”; v. 41: “Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting 
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels”). 

The voluntas consequens, according to which God judges and 
condemns all who do not believe the Gospel, Mark 16,16; John 3, 
16—18. 36, must therefore not be interpreted as an eternal decree 
of damnation, since according to His voluntas antecedens God 
desires the salvation of all sinners, 2 Pet. 3, 9; Matt. 18, 11; 
1 Tim. 2, 4. 

If the objection is raised that we must not speak of a voluntas 
prima and a voluntas secunda in God because there is neither 
a prius nor a posterius in Him, we answer that God is indeed the 
eternal, immutable Lord, in whom there is no change, or no prius 
or posterius, Mai. 3,6; 1 Sam. 15,29. However, since, in accom¬ 
modation to our feeble understanding, God has revealed Himself to 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


609 


us as the loving Lord, who desires to save all men, John 3,16.17, 
and then again as the righteous Lord, who punishes eternally all 
who will not believe on Him, John 3, 18. 36, we must speak as 
Scripture does and predicate of Him both a will to save and a will 
to condemn. However, this will to condemn is not the “reverse 
side” of His gracious election unto life, but rather that just punish¬ 
ment (iustitia vindicativa) which He inflicts upon all who wickedly 
despise His voluntas antecedent and will not hear His Word, 
Rom. 10, 21. 

As we must not argue from Scripture that “there is an eternal 
decree of damnation,” so we must argue this error neither from 
history. That is indeed the mistake of Calvinism, which reasons: 
“The result is the interpretation of God’s purposes” (cp. Calvin, 
Inst., Ill, 24. 12). From the fact that not all men are saved or 
that not all nations enjoy the blessings of the Gospel, Calvinism 
infers that God does not desire to save them. But also this position 
is anti-Scriptural; for Scripture commands us not to draw conclu¬ 
sions from the unsearchable judgments of God, but to adore them 
with awe and reverence, Rom. 11, 33—36. 

Of the unsearchable judgments of God the Formula of Concord 
says (Thor. Deck, XI, 57—63) : “Likewise, when we see that God 
gives His Word at one place, but not at another; removes it from 
one place and allows it to remain at another; also, that one is 
hardened, blinded, given over to a reprobate mind, while another, 
who is indeed in the same guilt (qui in eadem culpa haeret), is 
converted, etc., — in these and similar questions, Paul (Rom. 
11, 22 ff.) fixes a certain limit to us how far we should go, namely, 
that in the one part we should recognize God’s judgment [for He 
commands us to consider in those who perish the just judgment of 
God and the penalties of sins]. For they are well-deserved penalties 
of sins when God so punishes a land or nation for despising His 
Word that the punishment extends also to their posterity, as is to 
be seen in the Jews. . . . However, as regards these things in this 
disputation which would soar too high and beyond these limits, 
we should, with Paul, place the finger upon our lips and remember 
and say, Rom. 9, 20: ‘0 man, who art thou that repliest against 
God?”’ 

Hence we must not conclude as the Calvinists do: “Since God 
does not save all men, He does not desire the salvation of all,” and 
so try to explore the secret will of God; but we must rather adhere 
to the revealed will of God, made manifest in Scripture, which

THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


bears witness in many clear passages that God “will have all men to 
be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth,” 1 Tim. 2,4. 

As proof for the “eternal reprobation of the damned” Cal¬ 
vinism cites also Rom. 9,18: “Therefore hath He mercy on whom 
He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.” But this 
passage does not teach an eternal election unto damnation, but 
merely reveals God in His supreme sovereignty, according to which 
He is not subject to human criticism. 

That these words are not designed to deny universal grace is 
clear from St. Paul’s express teaching of that doctrine in chap. 
10, 21 and chap. 11, 32. In other words, the same God who has 
mercy on whom He will “stretched forth His hands all day unto 
a disobedient and gainsaying people” and “concluded them all in 
unbelief [that is, declared all men lost in unbelief] that He might 
have mercy upon all.” Hence the passage (Rom. 9,18) is not 
directed against the gratia universalis , but against the proud spirit 
of self-righteousness and work-righteousness in men, Rom. 9, 16. 

The Formula of Concord rightly interprets the passage when 
it writes (Thor. Deck, XI, 61): “No injustice is done those who 
are punished and receive the wages of their sins; but in the rest, 
to whom God gives and preserves His Word, by which men are 
enlightened, converted, and preserved, God commends His pure 
[immense] grace and mercy, without their merit.” 

In conclusion we may say that just as we are not to solve the 
mystery of election by denying the sola gratia (synergism), so we 
must not solve it by denying the gratia universalis and ascribe to 
God, contrary to Scripture, an eternal decree of reprobation. Both 
“solutions” are equally rationalistic and in direct conflict with the 
Word of God. 

7. WHY MANY REJECT THE SCRIPTURAL DOCTRINE 
OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 

The Scriptural doctrine of eternal election is the final test of 
a believer’s faith: “At the doctrine of the election of grace one 
writes his final examination in theology” ("An der Lehre von der 
Qnadenwahl wird das theologische Schlussexamen gemacht”), 
Christl. Dogmatik, III, 668. The doctrine of eternal election as 
taught in Scripture allows not even a trace of Pelagianism or 
rationalism to stand. It rather demands unqualified acceptance of 
Scripture as the only source and norm of faith (sola Scriptura), 
unqualified trust in Christ’s vicarious atonement as the sinner’s 



THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION. 


811 


only hope of salvation (sola fide), and unqualified recognition of 
the universality of the divine promises offered in the Gospel (gratia 
universalis). 

In his excellent “Historical Introductions to the Symbol¬ 
ical Books” ( Concordia Triglotta, p. 205) Dr. F. Bente writes: 
“According to the Formula of Concord, all Christians, theologians 
included, are bound to derive their entire doctrine from the Bible 
alone; matters of faith must be decided exclusively by clear pas¬ 
sages of Holy Scripture; human reason ought not in any point to 
criticize, and lord it over, the infallible Word of God; reason must 
be subjected to the obedience of Christ and dare not hinder faith 
in believing the divine testimonies even when they seemingly con¬ 
tradict each other. 

“We are not commanded to harmonize, says the Formula, but 
to believe, confess, defend, and faithfully to adhere to, the teachings 
of the Bible (1078, 52 ff.). 

“In the doctrine of conversion and salvation (election) there¬ 
fore Lutherans confess both the sola gratia and the universalis 
gratia, because they are convinced that both are clearly taught in 
the Bible and that to reject or modify either of them amounts to 
a criticism of the Word of God and hence of God Himself. 

“Synergists differ from Lutherans, not in maintaining uni¬ 
versal grace (which in reality they deny as to intention as well as 
extension, for they corrupt the Scriptural content of gTace by 
making it dependent on man’s conduct and thereby limit its 
extension to such only as comply with its conditions), but in deny¬ 
ing the sola gratia and teaching that the will of man enters con¬ 
version as a factor alongside of grace. 

“And Calvinists differ from Lutherans not in maintaining the 
sola gratia, but in denying universal grace" 

But if the Christian believer, on the basis of Scripture, main¬ 
tains both the gratia universalis and the sola gratia, then indeed 
the mystery remains: Why are some elected and others not ? (Cur 
alii, alii non f Cur alii prae aliis f) This mystery the true Chris¬ 
tian believer does not try to solve since it belongs to God’s un¬ 
searchable judgments and His ways which are past finding out, 
Bom. 11, 33—36. But he keeps all his thoughts on the doctrines of 
eternal election, conversion, and salvation within the revealed teach¬ 
ing of Scripture: He who is saved is saved alone by grace; he who 
is lost perishes through His own unbelief, Hos. 13, 9. From any 
attempt to solve the mystery which is involved in the doctrine of 



612 


THE DOCTRINE 07 ETERNAL ELECTION. 


eternal election he will abstain all the more, since God’s Word tells 
him that he now knows in part, but that in heaven he shall know 
even as also he is known, 1 Cor. 13,12. 

In summary, it is clear why so many reject the Scriptural 
doctrine of eternal election, namely, for the simple reason that 
they wish to “harmonize the divine testimonies when they seem¬ 
ingly contradict each other” (universalis gratia; sola gratia). 
Synergism harmonizes the divine testimonies by denying the sola 
gratia; Calvinism, by denying the universalis gratia. In both 
cases, as Dr. F. Bente says, “human reason criticizes, and lords it 
over, the infallible Word of God.” 

The real mystery in the doctrine of election exists because 
Holy Scripture does not explain why “some are struck by the Law 
and others are not struck, so that the former receive the proffered 
grace and the latter reject it” (Luther, St. L., XVIII, 1794 ff. 
19651). The Formula of Concord rightly says that “God has 
reserved this mystery for His wisdom and has revealed nothing to 
us concerning it in His Word” (Thor. Decl., XI, 54 f.). In place 
of this real mystery some Lutheran theologians have put the so- 
called “psychological mystery” (das psychologische Qeheimnis). 
That is to say, “it is impossible for us to understand how a person 
can resist divine grace after God through His Word has put him 
into a position in which he can truly and really convert himself.” 
Those who thus operate with a psychological mystery solve the Teal 
mystery in the doctrine of election in the old synergistic way; 
for not only do they assume a status medius, in which a still un¬ 
converted person can convert himself by means of divinely bestowed 
powers, but they also explain the question why one is converted and 
another is not by the synergistic formula: Conversion is due to 
the better conduct of the converted toward divine grace. For this 
reason we reject the “psychological mystery” as a synergistic notion 
and figment. The Scriptural doctrine of election is accepted in its 
truth and purity by those only who reject in toto every form of 
Pelagianism and rationalism. 

In view of the endless confusion which rationalism has caused 
in the Christian Church by perverting the Scriptural doctrine of 
eternal election we conclude this article with the sincere prayer 
with which the Formula of Concord closes its treatise on predestina¬ 
tion (Epit., XI, 23) : “May Almighty God and the Father of our 
Lord Jesus grant the grace of His Holy Ghost that we all may 
be one in Him and constantly abide in this Christian unity, which 
is well-pleasing to Him! Amen.” 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (eSOHATOLOGT).

THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS. 
(ESCHATOLOGY.) 

(De Eschatologio.) 

The Doctrine of the Last Things (de novissimis) is so called 
because it treats of that which is “the last,” namely, that “with 
which the present world comes to an end” (Schmid). Of the last 
things Baier writes: “They are called the last things ( novissima), 
in Greek rd eoxaza, because some both are, and are called, last with 
respect to men as individuals and others with respect to men col¬ 
lectively and to the whole world. To the former class belong death 
and the state of the soul after death; to the latter, the resurrec¬ 
tion of the dead and the corresponding change of the living, 
the final Judgment, and the conflagration of the world” ( Doctr . 
Theol., p. 625). 

We shall discuss the subject of Eschatology under the fol¬ 
lowing heads: 1) Temporal Death; 2) the Condition of the Soul 
between Death and the Resurrection (status medius); 3) the 
Second Advent of Christ; 4) the Resurrection of the Dead; 
5) the Final Judgment; 6) the End of the World; 7) Eternal 
Damnation; and 8) Eternal Salvation. 

1. TEMPORAL DEATH. 

(De Morte Temporal!.) 

a. What temporal death is. Temporal, or bodily, death is not 
the total annihilation of man (Russellism; atheism), but the dep¬ 
rivation of natural life, occuring through the separation of soul 
and body (Baier). That temporal death is not the annihilation 
of the soul is clear from Matt. 10,28; that it is not the annihila¬ 
tion of the body follows from John 5, 28. 29, where Christ tells us 
that the dead bodies, though turned to dust, are awaiting in their 
graves the day of resurrection (cp. also Dan. 12, 2). That death, 
properly speaking, is separation of the soul from the body is clearly 
taught in Luke 12, 20: “This night thy soul shall be required of 
thee”; and in Matt. 27, 50 (John 19, 30), where the death of our 
Lord on the cross is described as the “yielding up of the ghost,” 
or as the “giving up of the ghost.” 

Quenstedt fittingly directs attention to the fact that the death 
of Christian believers is depicted in Scripture by “sweet names,” 
such as “the gathering to their own people,” Gen. 25, 8. 17; 
a “departure in peace,” Luke 2, 29; “a turning away from the evil 



614 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


to come,” Is. 57,1; “a resting or sleeping,” Matt. 9, 24; 1 Thess. 
4,13; etc. “Death has become the gateway of eternal life.” 

On the other hand, the death of the wicked is usually described 
in Scripture by names which in themselves suggest its bitterness 
and dreadfulness, such as “going to one’s place,” Acts 1, 25; “being 
slain by the Lord,” Gen. 38, 7; etc. 

b. The cause of temporal death. The cause of temporal death 
is not that man was originally created mortal or at least with 
a propensity to die, Gen. 2,17, or that the matter of which the body 
consists is by its very nature perishable (Seneca: Morieris, ista 
hominis natura, non poena est; cp. also similar views of the Pela¬ 
gians and Unitarians), but that man has fallen into sin, Gen. 2,17 ; 
3,17 ff.; Rom. 5,12 ; 6, 23. Luther: “Der Tod kann die Suende 
nicht wegnehmen, weil er selbst verflucht und eben die ewige Strafe 
des Zornes Oottes ist.” 

The view of some modern theologians (Kirn) that death 
existed already before sin, but became a punishment through sin, 
is unscriptural (dreg yga<prjg). According to Holy Scripture, death 
did not exist until sin came into the world, Ps. 90, 7. 8. Sin is 
therefore a direct punishment (malum poenae), which God inflicts 
upon guilty man by His vindictive justice (iustitia vindicativa). 

Other causes of death which Scripture mentions must always 
be viewed in connection with man’s fall and subsequent trans¬ 
gressions. Thus Satan is a cause of death inasmuch as he is 
a “murderer from the beginning,” John 8, 44, while Adam is 
a cause of the death of all his descendants, Rom. 5, 12, because his 
guilt is imputed to all his children (culpa hereditaria). 

All calamities, such as pestilences, storms, famines, floods, the 
sword, etc. (Rom. 8, 35. 36), are properly called “instrumental 
causes” (Mittelursachen) of death because they directly bring about 
the destruction of life; but they are instrumental causes of death 
only because sin, its principal and primary cause, has “entered into 
the world,” Rom. 5, 12 ff. Hence we must not regard death as 
“nature’s way of ridding itself of the unfit” (Modernists), but 
absolutely and solely as the “wages of sin,” Rom. 6, 23. This truth 
the Christian believer must constantly keep in mind; for if he 
denies that death is a punishment of sin, he can neither under¬ 
stand properly nor estimate rightly Christ’s atoning death on the 
cross. In fact, quite consistently those who have denied the guilt 
of sin as the sole cause of death (rationalists) have denied also 
the vicarious atonement (satisfactio vicaria) of Christ. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 615 

c. The subjects of death. Scripture teaches plainly that all 
descendants of Adam are subject to death (Rom. 5, 12: “Death 
passed upon all men for that all have sinned”); and this fact is 
corroborated by experience. Hence all attempts to find a cure for 
death are a priori futile. The only way in which sinful man may 
be freed from death is through faith in Christ, “who hath abolished 
death and hath brought life and immortality to light,” 2 Tim. 
1,10; for while also the Christian believer is subject to temporal 
death, he does not “taste of death,” John 8, 52; 11, 25. 26. 

If the question is asked why also believers in Christ must die, 
Scripture replies, a) that they, too, are sinners according to the 
flesh (naiaios avtigconog), so that also in their case death is the 
wages of sin, Rom. 6, 23; 7, 24; but b) that in their case death is 
not joined with the sense of divine wrath (sensus irae divinae) or 
the “sting of death,” 1 Cor. 15, 55—57, so that to them death is no 
longer death in its proper sense, but a blessed sleep in Jesus, 
1 Thess. 4,13.14; Luke 23, 43 ; Phil. 1, 23. 

The Apology writes (Art. VI, 56): “Death itself serves this 
purpose, namely, to abolish this flesh of sin that we may rise abso¬ 
lutely new. Neither is there now in the death of the believer, 
since by faith he has overcome the terrors of death, that sting and 
sense of wrath of which Paul speaks, 1 Cor. 15, 56. This strength 
of sin, this sense of wrath, is truly a punishment as long as 
it is present; without this sense of wrath, death is not properly 
a punishment.” 

Instead of the sense of divine wrath (sensus irae) the Chris¬ 
tian by faith rather experiences the sense of divine grace (sensus 
gratiae), so that, when death approaches him, he joyously com¬ 
mends his soul to His Redeemer and departs in peace, Luke 2, 
29.30; Acts 7,59. (Cp. Luther, St. L., I, 1512.) 

Moreover, the Christian believer knows by faith that he is free 
from the “second death,” Rev. 20,14, or eternal damnation, John 
3,16—18; 5, 24; 1 John 3, 14 (cp. Luther, St. L., I, 1514), so 
that temporal death is without terror for him, Rev. 14,13. 

Lastly, the Christian believer is also comforted by the 
“sweet names” (epitheta omantia) which Holy Scripture ascribes 
to the death of God’s saints. (Cp. Luther, St. L., XIII, 1328ff.; 
VIII, 1230.) These sweet names (mortis dulcia nomina) are not 
empty titles, but true and blessed Gospel assurances of God’s grace 
and love, which give ineffable consolation to the dying believer.

THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (eSOHATOLOGT). 


2. THE CONDITION OF THE SOUL BETWEEN DEATH 
AND THE RESURRECTION. 

The number of Scripture-passages which describe the condi¬ 
tion of the soul after death is comparatively small, since Holy 
Scripture principally directs the attention of Christian believers 
to the day of Judgment and the eternal salvation following it 
rather than to the blessedness which they enjoy immediately after 
death, 1 Cor. 1, 7; Phil. 3, 20. 21; CoL 3, 4; 1 Thess. 4, 13 ff.; 
2 Tim. 4, 7. 8; Titus 2, 13. The Christian believer therefore 
patiently “waits” for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and 
rejoices in the glorious redemption which this day of salvation 
promises to him. Matt. 24, 44—46; Luke 21, 31. As Holy Scrip¬ 
ture comforts the believer preeminently with the glory of Christ’s 
second advent, so also it warns the unbeliever mainly by reminding 
him of the certainty of the final Judgment, 2 Thess. 1, 9.10; Heb. 
10, 27; 2 Pet. 2, 3—6; Jude 6. 7, rather than by direct references 
to his punishment after death, although such passages are not 
wholly lacking, Heb. 9, 27; Luke 16, 22. 23. 

The godly should therefore always rejoice in Christ’s second 
coming, Matt. 25, 34, while the ungodly must constantly dread His 
righteous judgment as the great and everlasting punishment which 
he shall not escape. Matt. 25, 41. 46. 

Nevertheless Holy Scripture speaks also of the condition of 
the soul after death. It tells us that the souls of the ungodly are 
“spirits in prison,” 1 Pet. 3,19, and that they suffer excruciating 
and endless torments, Luke 16, 23—31, so that death leads them 
directly into everlasting agony and anguish, Ps. 106,16—18. 

On the other hand, Scripture assures us that the souls of the 
godly are in God’s hand. Acts 7, 59. 60; Luke 23, 46, that they are 
with Christ in paradise, Phil. 1, 23; Luke 23,43, and that they are 
supremely happy, Eev. 14,13, in their new heavenly life, Ps. 16,11; 
John 17, 24; Eom. 8,18. In fact, they are so completely removed 
from all earthly trouble and sorrow that they are altogether igno¬ 
rant of those who live upon earth. Is. 63, 16, and their needs no 
longer concern them, Is. 57,1. 2. 

Hence we conclude that the souls of the believers are in a con¬ 
dition of perfect blessedness and of perpetual enjoyment of God, 
though we cannot picture to ourselves in what manner this won¬ 
derful fruition of celestial bliss takes place. We therefore reject 
every kind of soul sleep (psychopannychism) which excludes the 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


617 


active enjoyment of God on the part of the departed believer, 
Phil. 1, 23; Luke 23, 43. 

The statements of Scripture that “the dead sleep," 1 Cor. 
15,18, or that “the dead do not praise God," Ps. 6, 5, or that “they 
enter into rest," Heb. 4, 3, etc., do not prove the insensibility of 
the soul after death, but are figurative expressions, used in a sense 
which Scripture clearly explains. 

To draw inferences with regard to the condition of the soul 
after death from the nature of the soul (“The soul is never in¬ 
active,” etc.) is not permissible, since the conclusions so reached are 
most uncertain, and, above all, since Scripture is the only source 
and standard of faith, and its teaching must not be supplemented 
by human speculation. 

A psychopannychy which includes a real enjoyment of heav¬ 
enly bliss (Luther) must not be rejected as wrong since it does 
not contradict Scripture. Luther writes (St. L., I, 1758 ff.; 
II, 215 ff.) : “It is divine truth that Abraham [after death] lives 
with God, serves Him, and rules with Him. But what kind of life 
that is, whether he sleeps or is awake, is a different question. How 
the soul rests we cannot know; but it is certain that it lives.” 

With respect to the habitation of the souls (paradise, prison, 
(pvXcna)) Gerhard writes: “Scripture, by a general appellation, 
speaks of a place, John 14, 2; Luke 16,28; Acts 1,25. Not that 
it is a corporeal and physical place, properly so called, but because 
it is a 'where’ (nov) into which souls, separated from their bodies, 
are brought together. Scripture enumerates only two such recep¬ 
tacles, or habitations, of the souls, one of which, prepared for the 
souls of the godly, is called by the most ordinary appellation 
heaven , and the other, intended for the souls of the wicked, is called 
hell.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 632.) 

The so-called purgatory (purgatorium, as also the limbus 
infantium and the limbus patrum), in which, according to papistic 
doctrine, the souls of believers must expiate the temporal punish¬ 
ments for their sins, is a figment of reason; for Scripture teaches 
that all believers through faith in Christ obtain (not purgatory, 
but) eternal life, John 5,24; 3, 36. Moreover, it expressly teaches 
that not only the souls of saints, such as St. Paul and Stephen 
(Phil. 1, 23; Acts 7, 59), but also those of great sinners, converted 
in the last hour, such as the thief on the cross, entered with Christ 
into paradise, Luke 23, 43. (Cp. Luther on purgatory, St. L., 
II, 2067 ff.)

THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


Among modern Protestant theologians Kahnis advocated the 
doctrine of purgatory. He writes: “In the idea of a purgatory 
there undoubtedly is some truth, namely, that many Christians still 
need a purging. Great is the number of Christians of whom it 
cannot be said that Christ is their life. But they are drawn to 
Him and confess that which they have known of Him with a sin¬ 
cerity, disinterestedness, and faithfulness in conduct which ought 
to put to shame many Christians who are stronger in words than 
in works/’ (Pieper, Christl. Dogmatik, III, 576.) 

However, a Protestant purgatory has no more Scriptural 
foundation than has the papistic purgatory; for Christ promises 
to all who believe in Him eternal life, John 5, 24; 3, 36. In addi¬ 
tion, Scripture teaches that only the blood of Christ cleanses from 
sin, 1 John 1, 7, and not man’s work or suffering, Gal. 3,10. Not 
even faith purges from sin inasmuch as it is a human work, Bom. 
4,3—5; it saves only because it is the receiving means ( medium, 
Xrjnxixov), which lays hold of Christ’s righteousness and thus regen¬ 
erates the heart and frees the believer from the curse and dominion 
of sin, Bom. 6, 2. 14. All Protestant theologians who join Borne in 
teaching a purgatory eo ipso reject the sola fide and espouse the 
doctrine of work-righteousness. 

From the many Scripture promises which are made to Chris¬ 
tian believers it is clear that the soul of the dying Christian is 
entirely cleansed from all original and actual sin; for it is then 
in “paradise,” the holy abode of God’s perfected saints, Phil. 1,23; 
Luke 23,43. (Cp. Luther, St. L., X, 2119 ff.) Luther very aptly 
calls death the “last purgatory” of the Christians, meaning by this 
that the soul of the believer, after departing in Christ, is wholly 
free from sin. 

With regard to purgatory, Hafenreffer writes: “Everything 
that is ascribed to the satisfactions either of purgatory or of the 
intercession of the saints is detracted from the merit of Christ, 
which alone cleanses us from sin.” (Doctr. Theol., p.636.) The 
Lutheran Church thus rejects the doctrine of purgatory as con¬ 
flicting with that of justification by faith alone. 

Among modern Protestant theologians some (Schleiermacher) 
taught that the soul during the status medius (the time between 
death and the resurrection) must be endowed with a certain tem¬ 
porary body (Ztvischenleib), since otherwise it could hardly exist 
(Macpherson: “The individual wears a body suitable to his con¬ 
dition during that period”). But of such a temporary body Scrip-

ture knows nothing at all. The Christian believer may rest assured 
that God, who so wondrously created the soul for the body, is able 
to take care of it also while it is outside the body, 2 Cor. 5,1—9. 

The appearance of “Samuel” (1 Sam. 28) is best explained as 
a delusion of Satan (1 Sam. 28,19: “Thou and thy sons shall be 
with me”). Those who hold that in this instance God really per¬ 
mitted Samuel to appear must regard his appearance as an excep¬ 
tion to His fixed rule and must maintain, on the basis of Scripture, 
that Spiritism is a work and fraud of Satan, Deut. 18,10—12. 

With respect to the departed souls we may summarize the 
teachings of Scripture as follows: a) The departed souls do not 
return to earth, Luke 16,27—31; the appearance of Moses and 
Elijah at the transfiguration of Christ, Matt. 17, 3, was not an ex¬ 
ception to this rule, since these saints may be classified among the 
risen, Deut. 34, 6; 2 Kings 2,11. b) The departed souls are igno¬ 
rant of those living upon earth and of their affairs, Is. 63, 16. 
c) The adoration of the departed saints is not only unreasonable, 
but also idolatrous. Matt. 4,10. d) Scripture emphatically denies 
the erroneous opinion of those rationalistic theologians who claim 
that even after death conversion is possible, Heb. 9, 27. 

In 1 Pet. 3,18.19 St. Peter does not speak of the preaching of 
the Gospel, but rather of the proclamation of the divine judgment 
to those who during their life despised the saving Word of God. 
The exriQvgev (“He preached”) denotes Law-preaching, and not 
Gospel-preaching, as the context shows. 

3. THE SECOND ADVENT OF CHRIST. 

Holy Scripture teaches most emphatically that in His ap¬ 
pointed hour (Acts 1, 7; John 6, 28. 29) Christ, the God-man 
(Matt. 26,31), will appear visibly (Acts 1, 9.11) to all men at the 
same time (Matt. 24, 27. 30; 1 Thess. 5, 2) in divine glory, and 
surrounded by His assisting angels (Matt. 25, 31; 1 Thess. 4,16; 
Matt. 13, 41. 42), to judge “all nations of the earth” (Matt. 
25,31), both the living and the dead, the latter after their resur¬ 
rection (1 Cor. 15, 51; Dan. 12, 2; John 5, 28. 29), to cast the 
wicked into eternal hell-fire (Matt. 25,46), and to lead His saints 
into eternal glory (Heb. 9, 28), so that the Church Militant (eccle- 
sia militans) will in all eternity be the Church Triumphant 
(ecclesia triumphans). (Cp. Luther, St. L., IX, 951 f.) 

The Scriptural doctrine of Christ’s glorious return must be 
emphasized both over against the blasphemies of the ungodly, 



620 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


2 Pet. 3, 3. 4, and the forgetfulness of Christian believers, who 
because of the weakness of their flesh are prone to overlook their 
glorious hope, Mark 13, 23. 

With respect to the exact time of Christ’s second advent Holy 
Scripture teaches that this is both unknown, Matt. 24, 36; Mark 
13, 32, and unknowable to men, 1 Thess. 5, 2. 3; Matt. 24, 44; 
Ma±k 13, 33—36. If in spite of Christ’s warning even believing 
theologians (Bengel: 1836 is the day of the Lord’s return) have 
tried to compute the time of His second advent, this proves how 
deeply sinful curiosity (Acts 1, 6) is embedded in the human heart. 

However, while Christians should not try to compute the time 
of the Lord’s return (against Kussellism, Adventism, etc.), they 
should carefully observe the signs of the times, which God has ap¬ 
pointed in order to arouse His saints to greater watchfulness and 
preparedness. Matt. 24, 32. 33; Luke 21,29—31; 2 Thess. 2, 3 if. 
Concerning the signs of the times Luther rightly says that "all 
creatures serve this day by means of signs” (St. L., XI, 69). 

Among the signs of the times Holy Scripture names abnormal 
conditions a) in the realm of human activity and life (warfare, 
hatred against the Church, pestilences, famines, general distress, 
great wickedness. Matt. 24, 5—14. 37—39); b) in the realm of 
nature (earthquakes, floods, disturbances in the movements of the 
celestial bodies, Luke 21, 26.26); c) in the realm of the Church 
(the rise of false teachers, apostasy from Christ, Antichrist, Luke 
21, 8.16.17; 2 Thess. 2, 3. 4); etc. As sickness is a sign of the 
impending dissolution of the individual person (microcosm), so 
also the disturbances in the world (macrocosm) foretell its final 
destruction. (Cp. Luther, St. L., VII, 1480 ff.) 

That these signs are not recognized as such by men is a proof 
of the amazing stupor (mirabilis stupor) which sin has wrought in 
man (Luther, St. L., I, 254IT.). As Luther rightly says, man after 
the Fall lives in a veritable "Egyptian darkness” (St. L., I, 255). 

Especially is the wanton persecution of Christ and His Gospel 
a most certain sign of the coming Judgment; for this sin of sins 
involves the basest ingratitude on the part of man. After Christ 
has redeemed the whole world by His holy suffering and death, all 
men should gladly worship Him and join and support His Church; 
but instead they persecute those who love and serve Christ, Matt. 
24, 9; John 16, 2; Matt. 10, 17; Eom. 8, 36; Acts 14, 5. 6. 19; 
16, 22 ff. 

Despite this shameful ingratitude of men (Modernism; Anti- 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (e8CHATOLOOY). 


021 


christ), Christ most graciously preserves His Word upon earth and 
has it preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations. 
Matt. 24,14. But this is at the same time an outstanding sign of 
the times (Matt. 24,14: “Then shall the end come”). 

With respect to the signs which foreshadowed the destruction 
of Jerusalem and at the same time that of the world, Matt. 24, 
2—14.15—31. 32—51; 16, 27. 28, Dr. Stoeckhardt rightly remarks 
that the destruction of Jerusalem was “both a sign of the day of 
Judgment and the beginning of the final Judgment” ( Bibl . Oesch. 
d. N. T., p. 256). The “epitelesmatic” character of divine prophecy 
in general explains also this particular prediction; for in one un¬ 
divided prophetic vision the Lord here views both the things that 
are near and those that are farther removed, that is, both the 
destruction of Jerusalem and that of the world. 

With respect to the question whether the signs of the times 
have been fulfilled, Luther declares that “these signs have already 
largely (das mehrere Teil) come to pass, so that we cannot expect 
many others” (St. L., XI, 50f.). But to this we must add that 
intentionally the signs have been so arranged by God that no one 
can compute the exact day or hour of the Lord’s second coming. 
Thus even during the apostolic period it could be said, e. g., with 
regard to the sign given by Christ Matt. 24,14, that the Christian 
faith was spoken of “throughout the whole world,” Rom. 1, 8; 
10,18; 1 Thess. 1, 8; Acts 19,10; 1 Tim. 3,16. 

The purpose of the signs is not to lead Christian believers to 
determine the hour of the Lord’s coming, but to incite them to 
perpetual watchfulness, Matt. 24, 42. There is a certain analogy 
between the end of the world and the death of the individual Chris¬ 
tian; for while no one can know just when he will die, every one 
should always be prepared to meet God when in His appointed hour 
death should come to him, Amos 4,12; 2 Cor. 5, 9. 

The Lutheran Church, on the basis of Holy Scripture, rejects 
the doctrine of the millennium as a figment of the human mind. 
The Augsburg Confession (Art. XVII) voices its disagreement 
with millennialism when it says: “They condemn also others, who 
are now spreading certain Jewish opinions, that before the resur¬ 
rection of the dead the godly shall take possession of the kingdom 
of the world, the ungodly being everywhere suppressed.” 

The “Jewish opinion” (Acts 1, 6) appeared early in the Chris¬ 
tian Church and was known as chiliasm (an earthly reign of 
Christ lasting a thousand years). It was taught and defended in 



622 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


many forms (chUiasmus crassissimus , crassus, subtihs). While this 
classification is not quite accurate, it is helpful in distinguishing 
between the various types of chiliasm. 

The crassest chiliasts (crassissimi) expect a period of great 
spiritual and temporal blessedness, during which the consequences 
of sin upon man and the world will be removed. 

The crass chiliasts (crassi) expect the destruction of Anti¬ 
christ and the general conversion of the Jews, so that during 
a thousand years the Christian Church will enjoy a period of great 
peace and prosperity. This type of chiliasm teaches a twofold 
visible return of Christ and a twofold resurrection of the dead and 
either includes or excludes the earthly reign of Christ in Jeru¬ 
salem and the Holy Land. 

It is a characteristic of the fanciful dream of chiliasm that its 
advocates never agree among themselves on particulars; the various 
theories are so contradictory that the whole subject becomes repul¬ 
sive to the student of doctrinal aberrations because of its very 
complexity and inconsistency. 

The subtle chiliasts (subtiles) reject the doctrine of the two¬ 
fold coming and resurrection, but expect a period of unusual growth 
and prosperity for the Christian Church (Spener) before the world 
will be finally destroyed. 

Millennialism (millenarianism) has no Scriptural foundation 
whatever. The passages which are usually quoted in its favor 
(Is. 2, 2—1; 11, 6—9; Zech. 9, 9. 10; Joel 3, 2 ft; Micah 4, 
1—4; Rev. 20,1—10) do not predict a millennial reign at all, but 
describe the spiritual glory of the Church of the New Testament, 
which is brought about through the coming of the Messiah and the 
preaching of the Gospel throughout the whole world, Luke 2, 
13.14; 1,76—79; 1,46—55. 

Chiliasm is not only unscriptural, however, but also anti- 
Scriptural. It expressly contradicts Holy Scripture, which plainly 
teaches, a) that the time of the New Testament, and especially the 
last days before Christ’s coming, shall be a period of great perse¬ 
cution and suffering for all who love the Lord Jesus Christ, John 
16,33; Matt. 24, 9—13. 21—27; Luke 21, 16.17; and b) that 
Christ’s kingdom is not earthly and external, but spiritual and in¬ 
ternal, John 14, 27; 16,33; Rom. 5,1—5; Luke 17, 20. 21; Mark 
1,14.15; Luke 10, 9—11; Rom. 14,17—19. Moreover, by direct¬ 
ing the Christian hope to a worldly reign of Christ, chiliasm mis¬ 
directs and thus destroys the true Christian hope, which steadfastly 



THE DOCTRINE OP THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


623 


looks for that wonderful glory of heaven, Phil. 3,20. 21; 1 Cor. 

1, 6—8, into which the Church Militant shall be gathered at 
Christ’s second coining, Matt. 25, 34; 5, 3.10—12. 

To the objection of chiliasts that the small earthly Church of 
Christ which we see now certainly does not represent the glorious 
Church of our Lord we reply that our Savior deliberately foretells 
and describes the small size (Luke 12, 32; Matt. 20,16), the dis¬ 
tress and tribulation (Acts 14, 22), and the apparent defeat (Matt. 
24, 37. 38) of His Church on earth in order that His followers may 
be kept from the deceitful snares of all chiliastic delusions, Matt. 
24,42—51. 

Again, millennialism opposes other clearly established Scrip¬ 
tural truths; for it affirms a) a twofold visible coming of Christ, 
contrary to the express teaching of Heb. 9, 28, and b) a twofold 
resurrection, contrary to John 6, 40. 

If chiliasts contend that millennialism is at least a beautiful 
hope, which ought not to be weakened or destroyed in those who 
hold it, we answer that nothing is good or beautiful that is opposed 
to the teaching of Scripture. Eve, too, regarded the fruit of the 
forbidden tree as beautiful, Gen. 3, 6; but the beautiful thought 
of eating of the tree was a delusion of Satan, 1 Tim. 2,14, which 
resulted in her transgression and brought upon her and all her 
descendants unspeakable woe. 

Similarly many regard the thought of having a vicar of Christ 
on earth to rule over the Church as very beautiful, 2 Thess. 2, 
9—12; but the result is Antichrist, a servant of Satan, 2 Thess. 

2, 3. 4, who misleads thousands into eternal damnation, 2 Thess. 
2,12, through his very external piety. 

Chiliasm is Satan’s most subtle way of inducing believers to 
regard the crucified Christ as a stumbling-block and foolishness, 
1 Cor. 1,23; for their chiliastic dream is really the effect of their 
inward dissatisfaction with the lowliness of Christ’s Church 
on earth. 

To the objection that at least Rev. 20, 2 teaches a millennium, 
we reply, a) that this passage does not teach a millennium at all, 
since those “who lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years” 
are clearly described as “the souls of them that were beheaded 
for the witness of Jesus and for the Word of God,” Rev. 20, 4, 
so that the vision depicts not an earthly, but a heavenly scene; 
b) that the whole passage, Rev. 20, 1—10, is so obscure, that it 
cannot be a sedes doctrinae for chiliasm, especially since hardly

THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


two interpreters will explain it alike; e) that the ffiittle season” 
(fuxgdg xQ° V0 $) together with the “thousand years” embraces the 
entire time of the New Testament (Luther), since immediately 
after this “little season” the last Judgment will follow, Rev. 20,10; 
and d) that, since the Apocalypse is a prophetic book, “so full of 
obscure visions as well as allegorical and quasi-enigmatical forms 
of speech, extremely difficult to be understood, it must be expounded 
according to the analogy of faith or the clear and perspicuous 
Scripture passages” (Hollaz), which foretell the eschatological 
events in clear and unmistakable language. 

As the millennium, so also the “general conversion of the 
jews” is a figment of human reason. The champions of this error 
base their doctrine on Rom. 11, 26: “And so all Israel shall be 
saved.” But that this passage does not teach a general conversion of 
all Jews is clear a) from the context, which shows that the apostle 
understands the expression all Israel (nag , IoQarjk) in the sense of 
"the elect of Israel” (v. 28: “As touching the election, they are 
beloved”); and b) from the fact that in other passages he clearly 
states the fact that not all Jews, but only the elect will be saved 
(Rom. 11, 5: “There is a remnant according to the election of 
grace”; v. 7: “The election hath obtained it, and the rest were 
blinded”). 

St. Paul thus clearly distinguishes between spiritual Israel 
0 Iogar/k xaza nvsv/xa), which shall be saved, and carnal Israel 
(’logafjl xaza oagxa), which shall be damned. Cp. Rom. 9, 6: 
“They are not all Israel which are of Israel”; v. 7: “Neither 
because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children; but. 
In Isaac shall thy seed be called”; v. 8: “They which are the 
children of the flesh, these are not the children of Ood; but the 
children of the promise are counted for the seed”; v. 27: “Though 
the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, 
a remnant shall be saved”; v, 31: “Israel, which followed after the 
law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.” 

From this we conclude that the “all Israel that shall be saved” 
(Rom. 11,26) is the spiritual Israel (the elect in Israel), just as 
the expression “fulness of the Gentiles” (Rom. 11,25) denotes the 
elect of God among the Gentiles. The determination of time 
“until” (Rom. 11,25: “until faygi ovj the fulness of the Gentiles 
be come in”) stresses the truth that, as long as Gentiles shall be 
converted and saved, so long also shall the elect in Israel be brought 
in, that is, until the end of the world, Matt. 24, 14. The words 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


625 


“and so” (Eom. 11,26: xal out ok) describe the manner in which 
“all Israel shall be saved,” namely, by the divine calling of the elect 
in Israel through the Gospel, by which also the “fulness of the 
Gentiles shall come in,” Rom. 10,13—18. 

In accord with this principle the apostles preached the Gospel 
to both Jews and Gentiles, Acts 13,14—52, that during the same 
New Testament time of grace “all Israel” and “the fulness of the 
Gentiles” might come in, Rom. 10,1—4. Just so the Church of 
Christ must preach the Gospel of salvation to every creature and 
make disciples of all nations till the end of time, Mark 16,15.16; 
Matt. 28, 20; for through the blessed proclamation of the Gospel 
the elect among both Jews and Gentiles will be saved, Acts 13, 
43—49. (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 584ff.) 

The return of the Jews to Palestine, which is usually made 
a concomitant of the general conversion of the Jews, is based upon 
a bare literalism in interpreting Old Testament prophecies (Is. 11, 
11. 12; Amos 9, 11—15; Ezek. 40—48; Zech. 6, 12; etc.), which 
is as unscriptural as it is ridiculous. (Cp. St. L., XIV, 53.) These 
passages of course foretell and describe the building of the New 
Testament Church in Old Testament phraseology. 

4. THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD. 

(De Eesurrectione Mortuorum.) 

While the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead is both 
doubted (1 Cor. 15,35) and blasphemed (Acts 17,32) by the un¬ 
godly, contrary to their own natural knowledge of God as the 
almighty Creator and King of the universe, who can do all things, 
Rom. 1,19. 20, so that their unbelief is inexcusable, 1 Cor. 15, 35f., 
it is to the believing Christian a source of supreme joy and sweet 
consolation, 1 Cor. 15, 20—22 (Third Article: “I believe in the 
resurrection of the dead”). 

The doctrine of the resurrection is taught not only in the 
New, but also in the Old Testament, Job 19, 25. 26; Is. 26, 19; 
Dan. 12, 2. The Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, were re¬ 
proved by Christ as errorists, who “knew not the Scriptures,” 
Matt. 22, 29. At the same time Christ pointed out to them the 
large number of passages in the Old Testament which attest the 
resurrection, when He said: “As touching the resurrection of the 
dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, 
saying, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the 
God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,” 

40 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



626 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


Matt. 22, 31. 32. Hence, wherever in the Old Testament we read 
the gracious promise: “I am thy God,” we have a passage teaching 
the resurrection of the dead, since “God is not the God of the dead, 
but of the living,” Gen. 17, 7; 26,24; 28,13; Ezek. 37, 27; etc. 

Luther therefore is fully justified in saying that in Gen. 3,15 
also the abolition of death and the resurrection are taught, since 
death is the wages of sin. He writes (St. L., I, 240) : “This pas¬ 
sage embraces the redemption from the Law, sin, and death and 
points out a clear and sure hope of the resurrection and the renova¬ 
tion in a life after this. For if the head of the serpent should be 
bruised, then also death must be abolished and annulled.” 

We therefore maintain that the Christian faith in the resur¬ 
rection of the dead is as old as is the proclamation of the Gospel. 
It is a mistake on the part of modern theologians to claim that 
the doctrine of the resurrection was only gradually developed 
among the believers (Luthardt, Dogmatik, p. 412; Voigt: “The 
doctrine of the resurrection is found only in the later books of 
the Old Testament.” Biblical Dogmatics, p. 239). 

In opposition to this we hold that the doctrine of the resur¬ 
rection is found not only in such passages as Dan. 12, 2; Ps. 17,15; 
Hos. 13, 14; Is. 26, 19; Ezek. 37, 1—10; Job 19, 25—27, but 
also in all passages in which God reveals Himself as the God of 
His people, individually or collectively, Ex. 3, 6. 13; 4, 5, etc. 
Hofmann rightly says: “Nothing can be more erroneous than the 
opinion that the doctrine of the resurrection is a later idea, which 
resulted from human speculation. . . . There is no time in which 
faith can be conceived without this hope.” 

Since the doctrine of the resurrection belongs to the primary 
fundamental articles, without which the Christian faith cannot 
exist, 2 Tim. 2,17.18; 1 Tim. 1,19. 20, Hofmann’s statement that 
“faith cannot be conceived without this hope” is indeed Scriptural. 
The Old Testament believers would certainly have “made ship¬ 
wreck concerning faith,” 1 Tim. 1,19, had they not believed in the 
resurrection. 

It is nevertheless true that the full and complete revelation 
concerning the resurrection came with Christ and the fulness of 
His Gospel-preaching, John 5, 28. 29; 6, 39. 40; 1 Thess. 4, 16; 
1 Cor. 15 ; etc. 

According to Scripture the resurrection of the dead consists 
formally a) in the restoration of the same body which has perished 
by death, out of its atoms or particles that have been scattered and 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


627 


dispersed, Job 19,25—27; 1 Cor. 15, 42—49; and b) in the re¬ 
union of the body with the soul, 1 Thess. 4,14—17. The resur¬ 
rection therefore lies beyond the comprehension of man; it is 
a miracle of God’s omnipotence, just as is creation, 2 Cor. 1, 9; 
Rom. 4,17. 

Since the divine power, just as the divine essence, belongs to 
the three Persons in the Godhead without division or multiplication 
(una numero essentia, una numero potentia). Scripture ascribes 
the resurrection sometimes to the Father and sometimes to the Son 
in the same manner, John 5, 21, and to the latter not merely ac¬ 
cording to His divine, but also according to His human nature 
(John 5,22.27: “because He is the Son of Man”). The divine- 
human Redeemer of the world is also its divine Resurrector and 
Judge (John 5, 28: “All that are in the graves shall hear His [the 
Son of Man’s] voice”). 

The fact that the Verbum incarnation (Aoyos evangxog), or the 
God-man, is the omnipotent Lord, who on the Last Day will bless 
or condemn (Acts 17, 31: “by that Man”), is of great comfort to 
all believers, John 11, 23—27; Rev. 1, 5. 6, while to all unbelievers 
it is a cause of unspeakable terror, John 19, 37; Rev. 1, 7; 6,16.17. 

That the denial of the communication of divine actions 
(actiones) to the human nature is a most pernicious error (cp. the 
Calvinistic denial of the genus maiestaticum) is proved convinc¬ 
ingly by the very passages of Scripture which describe the resur¬ 
rection and the final Judgment as the work of the Son of Man. 

With respect to the question, Who will be raised from the dead ? 
(subiectum quod resurrectionis), Scripture answers very clearly 
that all men will rise again, both believers, 1 Cor. 15, 20—22; 
1 Thess. 4, 13—18, and unbelievers, John 5, 28; Acts 24, 15. 
Unitarians and other antichristian sects have invariably denied 
the resurrection of the wicked (Socinians, Adventists, Russell- 
ites, etc.); but Scripture asserts this fact in unmistakable terms. 
While Christ’s exhortation to rise spiritually through faith in His 
divine Gospel promises, Matt. 11, 28—30, can be resisted. Matt. 
23, 37, since He now works through means (potentia ordinata). 
His command on the day of Judgment to rise bodily from the grave 
cannot be resisted, Matt. 25, 31. 32, since He will then exert His 
divine power without means (potentia absoluta, efficacia irresisti- 
bUis, in nuda maiestate, lv zfj avzov). 

If the question is asked, Just what of man will rise from the 
dead? (subiectum quo resurrectionis), Scripture designates “the 



628 THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 

entire man that previously died” (Quenstedt; Dan. 12, 2; John 5, 
28. 29), in particular the body, the same in number and essence 
which was born in this life and which perished through death, 
Job 19, 25—27; Is. 26, 19; Rom. 8, 11; 1 Cor. 15, 53; 2 Cor. 
5, 4; Phil. 3, 21. 

The body, of course, will be united with the soul, as the very 
concept of resurrection implies; for as death is the separation of 
the body and soul, so the resurrection is the reunion of the body 
with the soul. Vox dvaoraoecoe important iteratam, stationem eins, 
quod ante steterat et ceciderat. Hence all who deny the numerical 
identity of the dead and the raised body deny eo ipso also the 
resurrection. Neither the resurrection nor the “change” (1 Cor. 
15, 51. 52: “We shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling 
of an eye”) of those who will live when the day of Judgment breaks 
will destroy the identity of the body. All those who doubt or deny 
the possibility of the resurrection our sovereign Lord reproves 
very severely: “Ye do err, not knowing . . . the power of God,” 
Matt. 22, 29. 

However, while the same body will rise from the grave, it will 
have new qualities. The resurrected bodies of the believers will 
be spiritual (owpiaia nvevfiaxued), 1 Cor. 15, 51. 52, that is, suited 
to the spiritual, heavenly life with God in glory. Holy Scripture 
describes the spiritual bodies of God’s saints as incorruptible, 
glorious, and powerful, 1 Cor. 15, 42—45; as “fashioned like unto 
His [Christ’s] glorious body,” Phil. 3, 21; and lastly as “like unto 
the angels of God in heaven,” Luke 20, 36; Matt. 22, 30. This 
similarity, however, must not be extended to the bodilessness and 
sexlessness of the angels; for while the human body will not per¬ 
form its former earthly functions in heaven (cp. the error of the 
Mormons), it will nevertheless be essentially the same body that 
lived upon earth, 1 Cor. 15, 47—49. 

Luther thus says (St. L., VIII, 1222): “The body remains ac¬ 
cording to its nature, but not the same use of the body [remains].” 
(Cp. also IX, 1242f.) Luther correctly describes the “natural body” 
(odb/jia. xpvyjxov), 1 Cor. 15, 44, as “the whole man as he lives with 
his five senses in this world and sustains himself by eating, drink¬ 
ing, maintaining house and home, wife and children,” etc., but the 
“spiritual body” (o&pa nvev/nazixor) as the glorified body, fitted 
for heavenly bliss. Of the saints of Christ Holy Scripture tells us 
in particular that “the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in 
the kingdom of their Father,” Matt. 13,43. 



THE DOCTRINE 07 THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


629 


That the bodies will rise in the same stature in which they 
were in death (children, youth, men, old men, etc.) is quite prob¬ 
able, since in the Book of Revelation we read: “And I saw the 
dead, small and great, stand before God,” Rev. 20,12. 

It goes without saying that the bodies of the righteous there 
will have no physical defects nor any traces of age or suffering, 
since all these are the consequences of sin. Chemnitz is correct 
when he says (De Duabis Naturis, p. 175): “The bodies are heav¬ 
enly, not with respect to substance, but with respect to qualities, 
because they will shine with heavenly light and glory, will no 
longer be subject to earthly infirmities, but will be distinguished 
by their heavenly luster and no longer be disfigured, corrupt, im¬ 
perfect, maimed, and unsightly, but most beautiful, pleasing to 
the sight, perfect, handsome, and complete in members, etc. An 
illustration of these qualities is presented to us in the body of 
Christ, as raised from the dead and placed at the right hand of 
God, to which our body is to be made like.” ( Doctr. Theol., 
p. 6421) 

Since the ungodly remain in their sin and under the divine 
curse, John 3,18. 36, their bodies will come forth from the graves 
“unto shame and everlasting contempt,” Dan. 12,2, so that all the 
defects and consequences of sin will be the more visible in their 
bodies, raised to everlasting disgrace. 

Chemnitz writes of this: “Although the bodies of the wicked 
and the damned will be incorruptible and imm ortal, yet they will 
not be impassible, but will be subject to eternal tortures and will 
be adorned by no honor, no glory, no power, no spiritual excellence, 
but will be marked by perpetual foulness and ignominy, destined 
to eternal disgrace, and oppressed by infernal darkness. They are 
vessels made unto dishonor and disgrace, Eom. 9,21; 2 Tim. 2,20.” 
(Doctr. Theol., p. 643.) 

While the righteous shall rise from the dead by virtue of the 
merit of Christ, 1 Cor. 15, 20—22, the godless will rise by the 
divine power communicated to Christ’s human nature through the 
personal union and exaltation to the right hand of God, by which 
He sustains, rules, and governs all things in heaven and earth in 
His general Kingdom of Power (regnum potentiae), John 5, 
25—29. As Gerhard well remarks, the resurrection of the godless 
pertains to Christ’s functions as Judge and not to His functions 
as Mediator and Savior (Doctr. Theol., p. 643). 

The view of some modern theologians (Kahnis, Nitzsch, Mar- 



630 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


tensen, etc.) that a germ of the resurrection body is implanted in 
the believers in this life, which either develops into, or serves as 
the nucleus of, the glorified body, is unscriptural. Holy Scripture 
does not teach such an Auferstehungsleib, nor does it say that it is 
implanted in the believer through the use of the Lord’s Supper. 

5. THE FINAL JUDGMENT. 

(De Iudiclo Extremo.) 

Immediately upon the second advent of Christ and the resur¬ 
rection of the dead there will follow the final Judgment (Matt. 26, 
31. 32: “When the Son of Man shall come in His glory, . . . then 
shall He sit upon the throne of His glory, and before Him shall 
be gathered all nations”). This immediate connection of the 
second coming of Christ with the general resurrection and the final 
Judgment excludes every possibility of a millennium; for when 
Scripture speaks of the last things ex professo (sedes doctrinae), 
it leaves no room for a chiliastic earthly kingdom of Christ. 

Those who will be judged are all men without exception, the 
pious as well as the impious, 2 Cor. 5,10; Rom. 14,10, the living 
as well as the dead, Acts 10, 42, as also the evil angels, 2 Pet. 2,4; 
Jude 6. The basis of Christ’s judgment will be His revealed truth, 
the Word of God, as Scripture clearly attests, Kom. 2, 16; John 
12,48; Rev. 20,12. The norm of judgment (norma iudicii) will 
be the works of men, 2 Cor. 5, 10; Matt. 25, 35—45. But the 
righteous will be judged only according to their good works, Matt. 
25, 34—40; Rev. 12,11, since their evil works, or sins, have been 
cast into the depths of the sea, Micah 7,19, or forgiven. 

When, on the one hand, Holy Scripture declares that all men 
will be judged (2 Cor. 5,10; Rom. 14,10: “we,” that is, believers), 
and, on the other, that the believer in Christ will not come into 
condemnation (John 5, 24: eig xqioiv ovx eg^ezai), this seeming 
contradiction is the old contradiction between the Law and the 
Gospel. According to the Law all men must appear before the 
judgment-seat of Christ. According to the Gospel the believers 
shall not come into condemnation. The appearance of the be¬ 
lievers before God’s judgment-seat will therefore not have the 
nature of a condemnatory judgment since their sins are forgiven 
through faith in Christ, Matt. 25, 34. 

Gerhard rightly remarks that also the eschatological teachings 
of Christ are both Law and Gospel and that also in this case the 
Law admonishes and warns all Christians so far as they are flesh, 



THE DOCTRINE OP THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


631 


2 Cor. 5,10; Rom. 14,10, while the Gospel comforts them in their 
fears and doubts, Luke 21, 28. Luther declares (St. L., VII, 
1794 f.) : “The Judgment pertains to the believers as little as it 
does to the holy angels. All believers enter out of this life into 
the kingdom of heaven without judgment and are even the judges 
of others.” This statement is true; for Christ expressly declares 
that the righteous will be separated from the unrighteous before 
the Judgment begins, Matt. 25, 32. 33. 

According to Scripture the Judgment is not a long-drawn-out 
process (indicium, discussionis)j but a momentary event (actio 
momentanea), Matt. 24, 27; Luke 17, 24. It takes place h dzdpcg, 
in an instant, h guifj dzp&alfwv, in the twinkling of an eye, 
1 Cor. 15, 51. 52. 

That the righteous shall judge the world with Christ is a clear 
doctrine of Scripture, 1 Cor. 6, 2—4. They will judge the world 
and the evil angels, inasmuch as they cooperate in Christ’s deci¬ 
sions and support His verdict (assessores). This great dignity, 
which Christ confers upon them out of pure grace, should prompt 
them to judge rightly between their brethren already in this life, 
1 Cor. 6, 5. 

6. THE END OF THE WORLD. 

(De Consummatione Mundi.) 

With regard to heaven and earth, or the world which God 
created in the beginning, Gen. 1, 1, Holy Scripture teaches in 
unmistakable terms that they shall “pass away” (Luke 21, 33: 
TiaQElevaovTai; Heb. 1, 10—12: a.7ioXovmai, “they shall perish”; 
dMaytjoovrat, “they shall be changed”; Ps. 102, 26—28: 

The meaning of the words pass away, perish, be changed, etc., 
in these passages is clear from the contrast in which the perishable 
“works of God’s hands” stand to Him, the eternal, imperishable 
Creator; for while He remains, they perish; while He continues 
the same and His years do not fail, they “wax old as a garment,” 
“are folded up,” and are “changed.” In the same contrast “heaven 
and earth” stand (Luke 21,33) to the “words of Christ”; for 
while Christ’s words do in no wise pass away, heaven and earth 
will pass away. 

In 1 Cor. 7, 31 St. Paul writes: “The fashion of this world 
passeth away (nagdyei to a^g/aa zov x6o/iov tovtov ). The “fashion 
of this world” is its present form, or the “present circumstances 
or conditions of all earthly things.” Similarly St. John writes: 



632 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


“The world is passing away” (o xdauog nagayerai), 1 John 2,17. 
On the basis of these Scripture-passages Christian theology 
teaches that the world in its present form will be entirely destroyed 
(2 Pet. 3,10: “The heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and 
the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the 
works that are therein shall be burned up”). 

However, our dogmaticians are divided with respect to the 
manner in which this shall occur. While most Lutheran divines 
(Gerhard, Quenstedt, Calov, etc.) teach a total destruction 
(annihilation) of the world quoad substantiam, others (Luther, 
Brenz, etc.) affirm that only the form of this world as it appears 
now will pass away; in other words, that the world will be destroyed 
only as it appears now. This teaching is based also on Rom. 8, 21, 
where the apostle writes: “The creature itself also shall be deliv¬ 
ered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of 
the children of God.” 

Luther thus writes (St. L., XII, 729f.): “The sun is waiting 
for another embellishment, which it shall have, together with the 
earth and all other creatures; namely, they shall be cleansed from 
every abuse of Satan and the world.” 

Quenstedt rejects this doctrine and writes: “The form of this 
consummation consists not in the mere change, alteration, or renew¬ 
ing of qualities, but in the total abolition and reduction of the 
world’s substance itself to nothing.” (Doctr. Theol., p. 656.) This 
doctrine he bases on such passages as Ps. 102, 26; 2 Pet. 3,10—13; 
Rev. 20,11; Is. 34, 4; Luke 21,33; Job 14,12. He states, how¬ 
ever, that this belief must not be defended as an article of faith, 
though “it corresponds more to the Scripture-passages which de¬ 
scribe the end of the world.” Nevertheless those who regard the 
destruction of the world as a change or renewal “should not be 
accused of heresy.” (Cp. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 609 f.) 

In view of the fact that the matter cannot be fully decided on 
the basis of clear Scripture-passages, other dogmaticians (Heer- 
brand, Hutter, Balthasar Meisner) suggest that the theologian also 
at this point place his hand upon his mouth and refrain from any 
definite teaching. Yet it may be added that even those dogma¬ 
ticians who regard the destruction of the world as a renovation 
of all things teach that in its present form the world will indeed 
pass away. Cp. 1 Cor. 15, 24: “Then cometh the end” (t eXog). 
So also Luther teaches (St. L., VIII, 1222) : “In short, all that 
shall cease which belongs to the substance of these temporal things, 



TUB DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


633 


or to the perishable life and works.” It is therefore an open 
question whether the world will pass away quoad substaniiam, by 
annihilation, or only secundum accidentia, according to its form 
and external appearance, by transformation. 

It is not advisable to take the passages speaking of a new 
heaven and a new earth (Is. 65, 17; 66, 22; 2 Pet. 3, 13; Rev. 
21,1) in a literal sense, since the “new heaven and the new earth” 
are “symbols of the heavenly mansions and eternal life.” Buechner 
(Handkonkordanz) remarks concerning these passages: “Just as 
this earth now offers man a comfortable home, so the children of 
God receive the most comfortable homes, full of all manner of 
blessedness, in heaven.” (John 14,1—4.) 

7. ETERNAL DAMNATION. 

(De Damnation® Aeterna.) 

At the last Judgment a complete and eternal separation takes 
place between the ungodly and the godly. Matt. 25,46: “These 
shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into 
life eternal ." 

The fact that there will be an everlasting punishment may be 
deduced to some extent also from the natural knowledge which 
man has of divine things, Rom. 1,18—21. The knowledge of God’s 
judgment (Aixalcojua) is a part of the divine Law which God has 
written in the human heart, Rom. 1, 32. On the basis of the Law, 
conscience condemns the sinful acts of man as transgressions, for 
which he is held accountable to God, Rom. 2,15; 1,20. 32. Hence 
also among the heathen we find a certain doctrine of an eternal 
retribution, though this, of course, is distorted by many fanciful 
speculations. (Cf. Christl. Dogmatik, III, 611 f.) 

Holy Scripture teaches the doctrine of eternal damnation so 
clearly and definitely that only those can rightly deny it who reject 
the divine authority of God’s Word (cf. the doctrine of restitution, 
dnoxazdozaan; zwv ndvzoiv, naktyysveoia , restitutio omnium). If 
any one presumes to reject the everlasting punishment (elg xokaaiv 
ahbviov ), he must reject also the everlasting life («V tcor/r aicbviov), 
since both are placed side by side, indeed, in contrast to each other, 
Matt. 25, 46; John 3, 36. 

While it is true that the term eternity is sometimes used in 
Scripture in the weakened sense of “long duration” (D^ijriy, 
Ex. 12,14. 24; 21, 6, etc.), it is employed in its strict sense (sine 
fine) in all those passages where it describes either the blessedness 



634 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (eSOHATOLOQT). 


of God’s saints in heaven or the misery of the damned in hell, 
2 Thess. 1, 9; Matt. 18, 8; Mark 3, 29. 

In addition, the endless duration of the agonies of the damned 
is clearly described in other unmistakable terms (Is. 66, 24; Mark 
9, 48: “where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched”; 
Rev. 14,11: “The smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and 
ever; and they have no rest day nor night”; Rev. 20,10: “And 
shall be tormented day and night forever and ever”). 

The Augsburg Confession therefore justly condemns all who 
deny the eternal punishment of Satan and his followers when it 
writes (Art. XVII) : “They condemn the Anabaptists, who think 
that there will be an end to the punishments of condemned men 
and devils.” Also the Apology declares (Art. XVII, Triglot, 
p. 335) : “At the consummation of the world Christ shall appear 
and shall raise up all the dead and shall give to the godly eternal 
life and eternal joys, but shall condemn the ungodly to be punished 
with the devil without end (sine fine)." 

If the objection is raised that the very idea of an eternal pun¬ 
ishment is so dreadful that it cannot be true, we reply that it is 
not for finite man, but for the infinite God to determine the punish¬ 
ment of those who have rebelled against Him, Jude 6—8. 

The argument that the idea of an eternal punishment is irrec¬ 
oncilable with divine love or with divine justice or with the unity 
of the divine “world-plan” (the final conversion of the penitent in 
hell and the annihilation of the impenitent) is based upon human 
speculation and not upon God’s Word, so that it is worthless, since 
God cannot be judged by our feeble sense, 1 Tim. 6, 16; Rom. 
11, 33—36. 

While the terms and adgg may denote either the state 
of death or the grave, Ps. 16, 10; Acts 2, 27. 31, they properly 
signify “the place (nov) in which the wicked suffer and in all 
eternity sustain the most miserable condition and ineffable tortures” 
(Gerhard). (Cp. Deut. 32, 22; Ps. 49, 14; Prov. 15, 24; Matt. 
11, 23; Luke 10, 15; 16, 23; etc.) 

Against the Russellites, who claim that neither nor fidrjg 
can mean hell in the sense of “the place of the damned,” we reply 
that we do not depend on these terms alone to prove the existence 
of hell, since the doctrine of an eternal punishment is otherwise 
clearly taught in Scripture (cp. yhvva, Matt. 5, 22; Mark 9, 43. 44; 
Luke 12, 5). 

The valley of Hinnom (Gehinnom) near Jerusalem, with its

ceaselessly burning fires to consume the city offal, was surely a fit¬ 
ting symbol of the eternal hell-fire, “where their worm dieth not 
and their fire is not quenched.” It is certainly most impressive 
that our beloved Savior, who is Love (1 John 4, 8), Himself taught 
the eternal punishment of the damned so persistently and emphati¬ 
cally, Matt. 5, 29. 30; 10,28; 11,23; Luke 16,23. The eternal 
punishment of the damned is proved also by Christ’s descent into 
hell (rot? lv cpvXaxfj nvev/uaoiv ... dneiihjoaoiv), 1 Pet. 3,18—20. 

Upon the basis of clear Scripture-passages we teach that the 
form (forma), or essence, of the eternal damnation consists in ever¬ 
lasting banishment from divine grace and communion, or in the 
everlasting separation of the damned from God’s love and mercy, 
Matt. 25, 41; 8,12; 2 Thess. 1, 7—9. Originally man was created 
for communion with God, and in this alone he finds supreme happi¬ 
ness, John 17,20—23; Ps. 17,15; Matt. 11, 28f. Hence separa¬ 
tion from God, the Supreme Good (summum bonum) and the only 
Source of every good and perfect gift, Jas. 1,17, in itself means 
suffering the greatest bodily and spiritual anguish. 

Holy Scripture, moreover, very carefully describes the un¬ 
speakable sufferings of the damned as “tribulation and anguish” 
(Eom. 2, 9), “being in torments” (Luke 16, 23), “being tormented 
in this flame” (Luke 16,24), “being cast into unquenchable fire, 
where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched” (Mark 
9,43. 44), “weeping and gnashing of teeth” (Matt. 8,12), “wailing 
and gnashing of teeth” (Matt. 13, 50), etc. In short, Scripture 
employs the strongest terms to show that the sufferings of the 
damned in soul and body are the greatest conceivable. In fact, 
they surpass our feeble understanding, since they are both con¬ 
tinuous and everlasting, the fire burning endlessly and yet not con¬ 
suming, Mark 3,29. 

While the suffering of the body in hell-fire will be extreme, 
the soul will be perpetually tortured with the sense of God’s wrath 
(sensus irae) and His eternal condemnation, Gal. 3,10, as also by 
the terrors of a fully awakened conscience (terrores conscientiae), 
Luke 16, 27. 28. Hollaz adds the pertinent remark that “the tor¬ 
tures of hell will befall the souls of the damned as soon as they 
have departed from the body,” i. e., in death, Luke 16, 23. 

To describe the torments of the damned more accurately, our 
dogmaticians divide them into privative and positive sufferings. 
The privative sufferings include a) forfeiture of the beatific sight 
of God, Matt. 25, 41; b) separation from the communion of the 



636 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LA8T THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


blessed. Luke 16,26: c) exclusion from heavenly light, rest, and 
happiness, Matt. 8,12; d) entire denial of pity, divine and human, 
Luke 16, 25. 26; and e) complete lack of everything that might 
comfort them, Rev. 6,16.17. 

The positive sufferings are both internal and external. The 
internal are the most inexplicable pains and tortures of the soul, 
Mark 9, 44, and the external, their association with devils, Matt. 
25, 41, their everlasting confinement in a place of unspeakable 
sorrow. Matt. 25, 30; 1 Pet. 3,18—20, and their ceaseless torments 
in fire that burns, but does not consume, Luke 16,23. 24; Rev. 14, 
10.11; 20,10.15. 

Whether the fire of hell is material (real fire) or immaterial 
(unspeakable torment) does not matter, for even in its figurative 
meaning (Gerhard, Quenstedt) the term denotes indescribable 
anguish and agony. Is. 66, 24. Our dogmaticians rightly warn all 
curious minds that it is much more profitable to seek to escape the 
agony of hell than to argue concerning what the fire of hell may be 
(Gerhard). 

Dr. Pieper aptly remarks that in hell there will be no atheists, 
since their torment in endless punishment will convince them of 
the existence of a righteous and omnipotent Judge, whose sov¬ 
ereignty must be recognized, Luke 16, 27. 28. 

The question whether the damned in hell will continue in sin 
may be affirmed in the sense that their entire moral condition of 
reprobation (lack of faith, hope, and inward obedience) is a cease¬ 
less state of transgression. To this we may add that the fire of 
hell is not cleansing (hell is no purgatory), but punitive, so that 
the damned will not be morally improved by it. Hence, if they do 
acknowledge God’s majesty, they will do so only under coercion 
in endless agony. 

That the damned will actually blaspheme God is hardly prob¬ 
able, Luke 16, 27. 28. The passage Rev. 16,11 no doubt refers to 
men who blaspheme God on account of the tribulations of this 
present life. 

That the punishments of hell differ in degree , according to the 
quality and measure of sin, Scripture teaches very plainly, Matt. 
11,24; Luke 12,47; Matt. 23,15. The sin that will be punished 
most severely is that of malicious opposition to the Gospel of Christ, 
Matt. 11,16—24. 

While on the basis of clear Scripture-passages we speak of hell 
as a place, Luke 16, 28; 1 Pet. 3,19, this must not be understood 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (E8CHATOLOGY). 


637 


in a physical sense. Nor are we to determine where this place is, 
since Scripture does not give us any information on this matter. 
Hell may be said to be where God reveals to the damned His eternal 
punitive justice by banishing them from His gracious countenance 
(Pieper). Quenstedt quotes Chrysostom on this point, who says: 
“Let us not seek where it is, but how we may escape it.” 

Hollaz concludes the whole matter with the fitting remark: 
“It is certain that the infernal prison is a real locality, Luke 16, 28; 
1 Pet. 3,19, separated from the abode of the blessed, Rev. 22,15; 
Luke 16,23. It is also probable that it is outside this habitable 
world, 2 Pet. 3,10; Matt. 8,12; but where this place definitely is, 
is unknown to men during the present life.” ( Doctr. Theol., 
p. 658.) 

With respect to the cause of eternal damnation it is clear that, 
while every sin (both original, Eph. 2, 3, and actual, Ezek. 18, 20) 
is by its very nature (natura sua, ut stc, meritorie) damnable, 
1 Cor. 5,11; Rev. 21, 8; Gal. 3,10, it is, in the final analysis, the 
sin of unbelief that actually condemns, John 3,16—18. 36; Mark 
16, 16. Through His vicarious atonement (satisfactio vicaria) 
Christ has secured perfect reconciliation for all men with God, 
so that in Him every sinner in this world is absolved from all 
transgressions, 2 Cor. 5, 19—21 (objective justification). Hence 
a sinner is punished eternally only if he refuses to accept God’s 
gracious forgiveness by faith in Christ. This is an offense so great 
that it is rightly punished with everlasting damnation in hell. 

However, if a sinner refuses to accept God’s gracious pardon 
in Christ Jesus, then both his original sin and his actual sins will 
also condemn him, since he can never atone for them, and so they 
are forever charged against him. It is for this reason that Scrip¬ 
ture, on the one hand, ascribes eternal damnation to the sin of 
unbelief, John 3,18, and, on the other, also to all other sins, Eph. 
5, 6; Gal. 5,19—21; 1 Cor. 6, 9.10; Rev. 22,15. 

If we bear in mind the explanation just given, we shall neither 
minimize the vicarious atonement of Christ (by teaching work- 
righteousness) nor the condemnable character of human transgres¬ 
sion (Rom. 6, 1: “Shall we continue in sin that grace may 
abound?”), but we shall trust the more in Christ Jesus, our divine 
Savior, and in the power of faith flee and combat sin, Rom. 6, 
2, 11—15. 

The purpose of Holy Scripture in revealing to us the doctrine 
of eternal damnation is to warn us against both unbelief (Mark 



638 THE DOCTRINE OP THE LAST THINGS (E8CHATOLOGY). 

16,16) and carnal security (Matt. 26,41; 1 Cor. 10,12) and so to 
move us to seek Christ’s gracious salvation, offered to all men in 
the means of grace. The doctrine of eternal damnation is the 
severest kind of Law-preaching, and its object is repentance, 
Matt. 3, 7—12. 

The warning, implied in the doctrine of everlasting punish¬ 
ment, is, however, meant not only for unbelievers, but also for 
believers inasmuch as they still are flesh (Matt. 8,11.12, addressed 
to “the children of the Kingdom”; 26, 24, addressed to Judas; 
24,42—51, addressed to the disciples). 

Mon tua, indicium postremum, gloria coeli, 

Et dolor inferni aunt meditanda tibi. 

While the doctrine of hell will never convert a soul, since the 
Law only “worketh wrath,” Rom. 4, 15, it is nevertheless “our 
schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified 
by faith,” Gal. 3, 24. Hence all preachers who deny the eternal 
punishment of the wicked are not “merciful theologians” (miseri- 
cordes theologi), but the most cruel of all false prophets, who, 
instead of warning the sinner against his terrible doom, Ezek. 3, 
17—19, do all in their power “to drown men in destruction and 
perdition,” 1 Tim. 6, 3—5. Christ and His holy apostles taught 
the doctrine of eternal retribution with great clearness and em¬ 
phasis, Mark 9, 43 ff.; 2 TheBS. 2, 9, and their example every Chris¬ 
tian preacher must follow as a faithful minister of Christ and 
a loyal steward of God’s mysteries, 1 Cor. 4,1. 2. 

The doctrine of eternal damnation serves also to illustrate 
God’s righteous judgment over all transgressors, Rom. 2, 5. 6; 3,4. 
But since God earnestly desires that all men be saved (voluntas 
antecedcns), John 3, 16, it is only by His voluntas consequens, 
John 3,18. 36, that He exhibits and glorifies His righteous wrath 
and punishment. 

The Calvinistic doctrine of a reprobation to hell “from eter¬ 
nity” is unscriptural. God never intended man for hell, but only 
for heaven, 1 Tim. 2 r 4—6. 

The doctrine of eternal damnation is denied by the Restora- 
tionists, who teach that the future punishment is not retributive, 
but remedial and will result in the salvation of all men and, 
as some hold, of the evil angels. (Restitution of all things; 
djioxcndozaois; second probation). Likewise it is denied by the 
AnnihUationists, who teach that the wicked will be completely 
destroyed either at the Judgment or later. Both errors are opposed 
to the clear statements of Scripture. 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY).

8. ETERNAL SALVATION. 

(De Beatitudine Aetema.) 

a. The fact of eternal salvation. That there is an everlasting 
life in glory and bliss for all true believers in Christ Jesus is the 
culmination of all Gospel revelation in Holy Scripture, Rom. 
5,1.2; Eph. 2,4—6. The explanation of the Second Article of 
the Creed thus says: “I believe that Jesus Christ has redeemed 
me . . . that I may be His own and live under Him in His kingdom 
and serve Him in everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessed-, 
ness, even as He is risen from the dead, lives, and reigns to all 
eternity.” So also the Formula of Concord (Thor. Decl., XI, 
14—22): “God in His purpose and counsel [of grace] ordained 
that finally He will eternally save and glorify in life eternal those 
whom He has elected, called, and justified.” 

The blessed doctrine of life eternal through faith in Christ 
cannot be learned from reason since it belongs to “the wisdom of 
God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained 
before the world unto our glory,” 1 Cor. 2, 7—9. 

The Christian hope of eternal life (John 17, 3) must there¬ 
fore not be confounded with the pagan doctrine of the immortality 
of the soul or of its continued existence after death, which even 
human reason may excogitate. Concerning the arguments for the 
immortality of the soul we may note the following: a) “Since the 
soul is immaterial and simple, it is indissoluble” (Plato, Leibniz; 
the metaphysical proof) ; b) “The rich capacities of the soul can¬ 
not be satisfactorily developed in this life; its destiny must there¬ 
fore be extended to a future life” (Cicero, Lotze; teleological 
proof); c) “Man strives after virtue as well as after happiness; 
but this life affords no satisfaction with regard to either” (Kant; 
argumentum ethonomicum) ; d) “Love for country is inspired only 
by the promise of life beyond death” (J. G. Fichte; argumentum 
iuridicum) ; e) “All men by nature believe in the immortality of 
the soul” (Homer, Vergil, Cicero; argumentum e consensu gen¬ 
tium; cp. Doctr.Theol., p. 631f.). 

However, all the “heavens” of the heathen (unbelievers) are 
man-made and are just as much a caricature of the heaven of Scrip¬ 
ture as every man-made savior is a caricature of the divine Savior. 
Though the heathen have always speculated on the immortality of 
the soul, St. Paul bears witness that despite their eschatological 
speculations they are “without God,” “having no hope ... in the 
world,” Eph. 2,12. Karl Hase rightly states that “in the hovel of 
the poorest peasant there is a stronger faith in an eternal life than 



640 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


in the lecture halls of the greatest philosophers.” (Cf. Christl. 
Dogmatik, III, 619.) 

Only he can in reality have the hope of eternal life who truly 
believes in Christ Jesus, God’s only-begotten Son, and in His 
vicarious death for the sins of the world, John 3,16; 11, 23—27. 
Even the “sweetest thoughts” on the future life of the soul are 
dreadful without faith in Christ, since they can never silence the 
accusing and condemning voice of conscience, Eom. 2,16.16. 

b. What eternal life is (forma beatitudinis aetemae). Accord¬ 
ing to Holy Scripture the life eternal which Christ will graciously 
bestow upon His followers consists in the perpetual beatific vision 
of God, Job 19, 25—27; Acts 7, 56; Matt. 5, 8; 2 Cor. 5, 1—6; 
1 Cor. 13,12; 1 John 3, 2. In this life Christian believers see God 
only through faith by means of His Word, and, as it were, in an 
image, 1 Cor. 13,12 (cognitio Dei abstractiva); but in heaven they 
will behold Him without an image or veil, face to face (cognitio 
Dei intuitiva). 

This beholding of God is beatific, that is, it is joined with 
supreme bliss, Ps. 17,15, so that the blessed will never desire any 
other happiness than that of seeing God, the Supreme Good and 
Source of all perfect enjoyment. From this it follows that they 
can never fall away from Him, but they are confirmed in their 
heavenly glory (Rev. 14,13; John 10,27—29; Ps. 16,11; John 
17, 24; Rev. 7, 9—17). There will be no spiritual foe to interfere 
with their bliss (Rev. 20,10). 

Quenstedt describes the everlasting happiness of the blessed as 
follows: “The form [of eternal life] consists, generally speaking, 
in the ineffable, most full, and never-ending reception of incom¬ 
prehensible blessings. The blessings of eternal life are either 
privative or positive. 

“The privative blessings are the absence of sin and of all causes 
of sin, namely, the flesh inciting, the devil suggesting, the world 
seducing, and of the punishments of sin, such as various calamities, 
18.25,8; 49,10; Rev. 21, 4; temporal death, Hos. 13,14; 1 Cor. 
15, 26. 55—57; Rev. 2, 7, and eternal damnation, Rev. 2, 11; 
20,14. Here also belongs immunity from the affections and actions 
of the animal body as such, as, for example, hunger, thirst, eating, 
drinking, the use of marriage, etc., Rev. 7,16.17; Matt. 22, 30. 

“Some of the positive blessings of life eternal are internal, 
while others are external. The internal positive blessings, among 
which the beatific and immediate sight of God is preeminent, 
belong to the entire composite being and affect both body and soul 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


641 


of the blessed. The internal blessings of either part of the com¬ 
posite being belong either to the soul or to the body. Those of 
the soul are: a) the perfect enlightenment of the intellect, 1 Cor. 
13, 9—12; b) complete rectitude of the will as well as the appetite, 
Ps. 17,15; Eph. 5, 27; c) the highest security concerning the per¬ 
petual duration of this blessedness, John 16, 22. Those of the body 
are: a) spirituality, 1 Cor. 15, 44. 47; Phil. 3, 21; b) invisibility, 
1 Cor. 15, 44; c) impalpability, 1 Cor. 15, 44. 48; d) illocality 
(ibid.); e) subtility (ibid.); f) agility, 1 Thess. 4,17; g) impas¬ 
sibility, Rev. 7, 16; 21,4; h) immortality and incorruptibility, 
1 Cor. 16, 42—48.53; 2 Cor. 5, 4; i) strength and soundness, 
1 Cor. 15, 43; j) brilliancy, Dan. 12, 3; Matt. 13, 43; 1 Cor. 16, 
41.43; k) beauty, 1 Cor. 15, 43; Phil. 3, 21. 

“The external positive blessings are those which the blessed 
experience deeply outside of themselves. Of these two are chief: 
a) the most delightful communion with God, Luke 23, 43; John 
12, 26; 14, 3; 17, 24; 2 Cor. 5, 8; Phil. 1, 23; 1 Thess. 4, 17; 
Rev. 21, 3, with the angels, Heb. 12, 22, and with all the blessed, 
Matt. 8, 11; Luke 13, 29; Heb. 12, 23, consisting in the mutual 
presence, the most agreeable conversations, and the rendering of 
mutual honor, joined with mutual love; and b) a most beautiful 
and magnificent abode.” (Doctr. Theol., p. 661 f.) 

With respect to the beatific vision, Scripture teaches that this 
is accomplished not merely by means of mental contemplation 
(visio mentalis), but by the actual sight of the eyes (visio cor- 
poralis), 1 Cor. 9,12; Job 19, 25—27; 1 John 3,2. Those who 
doubt the possibility of the beatific vision may just as well doubt 
the possibility of all of heaven, since the entire doctrine of eternal 
life transcends our feeble understanding. That the blessed in 
heaven will recognize not only God, but one another is plainly 
taught in Scripture, Matt. 17, 3. 4; Rev. 7, 13. 14. Hafenreffer 
writes: “Because the perfect image of God in which we had been 
created will be fully restored, we shall be endowed also with per¬ 
fect wisdom and knowledge. Hence, if Adam before the Fall im¬ 
mediately recognized his rib in Eve, much more in the life to come, 
when all these gifts will be far more perfect, shall we recognize 
one another, Luke 16, 23 ; Matt. 17,1 ff.” (Doctr. Theol., p. 662.) 

Whether the blessed will recognize the damned in hell is not 
certain, though it is quite probable, Luke 16, 23 ff. Dr. Pieper 
wisely suggests that it is best to leave this question unanswered. 
That such recognition, if it should occur, does not disturb the 

41 


CHRISTIAN DOGMATICS. 



642 


THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 


happiness of the saints, Hutter explains as follows: “The will of 
the blessed will in all things concur with that of God. Such carnal 
affections as are signs of our weakness in this life will entirely 
cease in the life to come, when our love will extend to those who 
are beloved of God and whom He has made heirs of everlasting 
life. But in the damned they will supremely admire and eternally 
praise the exalted justice of God.” ( Doctr.Theol ., p. 662.) 

c. How Scripture describes life eternal. Gerhard rightly sug¬ 
gests that what eternal life is can be known from the revelation 
of the Word only in a general and obscure manner (mViy/iarixmc). 
As a matter of fact, while Holy Scripture speaks of eternal life in 
many places, it does not supply us with many details regarding 
its exalted nature. This method of teaching the Holy Spirit has 
chosen designedly; for in this life we have no adequate conception 
of the nature of things that lie beyond space and time. 

Nevertheless the description of eternal life which God’s Word 
provides is sufficient to give us a foretaste of the coming glory, 
Kom. 8,18, and to make us long for heaven, Phil. 1, 23. Nega¬ 
tively Scripture describes the blessedness of God’s saints in heaven 
as complete freedom from all the ills of this life, 2 Tim. 4,18; Rev. 
7, 16. 17; 21, 4; positively, as supreme and perfect bliss, 1 Pet. 
1,8.9; Ps. 16,11; John 17,24. Moreover, Scripture depicts the 
perfect joy of eternal life by means of symbols that give us a fore¬ 
taste of heaven’s perfect glory (Matt. 25,10; Rev. 19, 9 : marriage; 
Luke 13,29; Matt. 8, 11: a feast of joy; Luke 22, 30: sitting 
upon thrones). That these pictures must not be explained in 
a physical or earthly sense Scripture expressly shows, Luke 22, 
24—30; Matt. 22, 30. 

However, not only the soul, but also the body will share in 
the eternal bliss of heaven, 1 Cor. 15,44; for it shall be like the 
glorified body of Christ, Phil. 3, 21, and shall shine as the sun, 
Matt. 13, 43, being free from all consequences of sin, 1 Cor. 
15, 42. 43. 

The language which will be used in heaven is not earthly, but 
heavenly, so that it cannot be known upon earth (2 Cor. 12, 4: 
“unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter”). 

While there are no degrees of bliss, since all the saints of 
Christ shall see God and so will be completely blessed, Scripture 
teaches that there are degrees of glory (<5o£a, gloria), commen¬ 
surate with the faithfulness and sufferings of Christian believers 
in this life, 2 Cor. 9, 6; 1 Cor. 15, 41. 42 ; Dan. 12, 3. ( Omnibus 

una salus sanctis, sed gloria dispar; cp. Luther, St. L., VIII, 



THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (E80HAT0L0GY). 


643 


1223 f.) These differences in glory will of course not arouse envy, 
since jealousy is sin, Gal. 6, 20. 21, and sin will be completely 
abolished in heaven, Ps. 17,16; 16,11. 

Heaven indeed must be conceived of as a certain place ( nov ), 
where the blessed will see God and perfectly enjoy supreme glory. 
Matt. 5, 12; 6, 20; 1 Pet. 1, 4; Mark 16, 19; yet we must not 
understand this “certain nov” in a physical sense. As the nov 
damnatorum is everywhere where God reveals His eternal puni¬ 
tive justice, so the nov beatorum is everywhere where God reveals 
His eternal grace and love in unveiled glory. Thus the angels are 
always in heaven, even when they minister to the saints on earth, 
Matt. 18,10; Luke 1,19. 

d. The saints in heaven. Scripture describes as the saints of 
God who shall inherit eternal life all those who believe in Christ, 
John 3,16—18. 36. For this reason it is wrong to ascribe eternal 
life also to non-believers on the basis of their iustitia naturalis et 
civilis (Zwingli, Hofmann; cp. Luther, St. L., XX, 1766f., against 
Zwingli, who expressed the hope to find such heathen as Hercules, 
Theseus, Socrates, etc., in heaven). Christ expressly commanded 
His disciples to preach the Gospel to every creature, adding the 
warning that whosoever believeth not shall be damned, Mark 16, 
15.16; Luke 24, 47; cp. also Acts 26,18. 

That only true believers shall be eternally saved appears also 
from all passages in Scripture, a) in which Christian ministers are 
commanded to be faithful and diligent in their sacred office in 
order that not a soul may be lost through unbelief, Ezek. 3,18.19; 
2 Tim. 4,1. 2; 2, 23—26; 1 Tim. 4,15.16; b) in which all Chris¬ 
tians are exhorted to instruct, reprove, and warn their erring 
brethren lest they lose their soul’s salvation through apostasy, Matt. 
18,15—17; 1 Cor. 5; and c) in which all Christians are admon¬ 
ished to lead a holy life lest they become guilty of any one’s dam¬ 
nation through the offense of denying the Christian faith and 
profession, Matt. 18, 6. 7. 

e. The purpose of the doctrine of eternal salvation. As the 
doctrine of eternal damnation serves to warn men against unbelief 
and carnal security, so the doctrine of eternal life serves to incite 
the believers to greater faith and to sustain them in their faithful 
following of Christ, Matt. 10, 22; 24,13; Mark 13,13. A truly 
Christian life is impossible without constant consideration of the 
sure hope of eternal life, Phil. 3, 12—14; 1, 23. 24; Matt. 6, 
19—21. (Cp. Luther, St. L., IX, 930 ff.) 


644 THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAST THINGS (ESCHATOLOGY). 

In this life Christian believers do not receive that recognition 
which they deserve as children of God, 1 John 3, 2, just as little as 
their Savior was appreciated during His sojourn on earth, Is. 53, 
1—3; John 1,10.11. Moreover, as they are hated and troubled 
by "all men,” Matt. 10,22. 25; 24,9, they must endure much tribu¬ 
lation in general before they can enter into God’s Kingdom of 
Glory, Acts 14, 22. Hence they should constantly direct their 
attention to their sure inheritance in heaven in order that they 
may overcome all evil and gain the eternal victory, Matt. 5, 12; 
2 Cor. 4,16—18. All manner of tribulation is the earthly lot espe¬ 
cially of the Christian ministers, 2 Tim. 2, 9; 2 Cor. 4, 7—11, since 
the world detests the Gospel of Christ, 1 Cor. 1,23, and will abomi¬ 
nate it till the end of time, 2 Tim. 4,10. 

But in all their tribulation Christian believers will overcome 
and gain the victory, Rom. 8, 35—39, if after the example of the 
apostle, 2 Tim. 1, 12, they continue in faith and hold fast their 
Spirit-sealed hope of eternal glory, John 16, 33; 1 John 5, 4. 5; 
Rev. 2, 7—11; 12,11. (Cp. Luther, St. L., II, 1237.) 

Of the practical use of the doctrine of eternal life, Gerhard 
writes very beautifully: "The doctrine concerning the heaven of 
the blessed and eternal life is set forth in Holy Scripture not that 
we may idly dispute as theorists concerning the locality of heaven, 
the beatific vision, the properties of the glorified bodies, but that, 
as practical men, considering the promised joys of eternal life every 
day, aye, every hour, aye, every moment, we may keep closely to 
the way leading thither and carefully avoid all that may cause 
delay or recall us from entrance into life eternal. 

"In 2 Cor. 4,18 the godly are well described by the apostle as 
looking not at the things which are seen (ra fikenofieva), but at the 
things which are not seen (id fxr\ (iXuiofuva). One of the ancients 
who was asked what books he used in his daily studies answered 
that he studied every day a book with three pages, one red, one 
black, one white; that on the red page he read of our Lord’s 
Passion, on the 1 lack, of the torments of the lost, and on the 
white, of the joy> of the glorified, and that from this study he 
derived more profit than if he would ponder all the works of the 
philosophers.” ( Doctr. Theol., p. 663.) 

“Christus gubemet mcntes nostras ad veram pietatem, 

Et restituat ecclesiae piam et perpeluam concordiam! Amen.”
